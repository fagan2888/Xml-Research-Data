    <AbstractNarration>This grant supports a workshop on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing (EBM) and Remanufacturing in the Transport Industries, to be held in Ypsilanti, Michigan, October 4-6, 2001. Ford Motor Company and the Integrated Manufacturing Technology Initiative (IMTI) are also supporting the workshop. The objective of the workshop is to invite participants from industry and academia to discuss future directions and opportunities for research collaboration in EBM that will serve as a roadmap for the development of future research projects. While research in the fields of Design for the Environment (DfE) and Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) have focused on the product, there is a need to focus on processes and their impact both on the manufacturing aspects and on the product life cycle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will explore the EBM issues to establish the fundamental research needs to address current and future manufacturing enterprise.</AbstractNarration>
