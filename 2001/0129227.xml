    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0129227&lt;br/&gt;Cameron M. Gordon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Mathematics at the University of Texas &lt;br/&gt;at Austin will host the 2002 Spring Topology and Dynamics &lt;br/&gt;Conference. Now in its 36th year, this is the largest annual &lt;br/&gt;topology conference in the US. It has a broad scope that &lt;br/&gt;encompasses set-theoretic and general topology, continuum&lt;br/&gt;theory and dynamical systems, geometric group theory and &lt;br/&gt;geometric topology. It thus provides a unique forum for &lt;br/&gt;researchers in a wide range of disciplines within topology. &lt;br/&gt;There will be eight invited plenary one-hour lectures of a semi-expository nature, given by leading researchers in the &lt;br/&gt;areas covered. There will also be twenty invited half-hour &lt;br/&gt;lectures, together with 15-minute contributed talks, held in&lt;br/&gt;four parallel sessions. The invited speakers have been &lt;br/&gt;selected with the help of an advisory committee of experts &lt;br/&gt;in the various subfields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is one of the major subdisciplines of mathematics, &lt;br/&gt;and, at just over a hundred years old, the youngest. It &lt;br/&gt;originated with Henri Poincare around 1900, who introduced &lt;br/&gt;it as a means of describing the qualitative behavior of &lt;br/&gt;certain physical systems (for example, our solar system),&lt;br/&gt;whose complexity renders a precise quantitative analysis &lt;br/&gt;too difficult. The wide range covered by the subject today &lt;br/&gt;is well represented by the Conference. General topology deals &lt;br/&gt;with the abstract properties of topological spaces; set-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;topology impinges upon the logical foundations of mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;The study of dynamical systems is close to Poincare's original motivation, and deals with the behavior of various iterative &lt;br/&gt;processes. These often give rise to complex objects, continua,&lt;br/&gt;which are studied in their own right. Geometric topology &lt;br/&gt;deals with manifolds, objects which are locally like &lt;br/&gt;n-dimensional Euclidean space, but whose global structure &lt;br/&gt;might be quite complicated. For instance, there is a lot &lt;br/&gt;of current activity in 3-dimensional topology, whose goal is&lt;br/&gt;essentially to describe all theoretically possible &lt;br/&gt;3-dimensional universes. Rich connections have recently &lt;br/&gt;been discovered between this subject and quantum physics, &lt;br/&gt;while on the other hand topological techniques from the &lt;br/&gt;theory of knots in 3-dimensional space have recently &lt;br/&gt;been applied to the study of DNA. Finally, geometric &lt;br/&gt;group theory, a relatively new subject, studies groups, &lt;br/&gt;which are algebraic objects, from a topological point of view; &lt;br/&gt;this is leading to deep connections between topology and &lt;br/&gt;algebra. The interaction at the Conference between workers &lt;br/&gt;in all these different branches of topology is expected to &lt;br/&gt;be very fruitful.</AbstractNarration>
