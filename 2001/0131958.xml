    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0131958&lt;br/&gt;Bowker, Geoffrey&lt;br/&gt;University of California - San Diego&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BDEI: Designing an Infrastructure for Heterogeneity in Ecosystem Data, Collaborators and Organizations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biodiversity and ecosystems data are currently being gathered in a large range of formats by a&lt;br/&gt;constellation of loosely connected private, government and not-for-profit agencies. The normal response&lt;br/&gt;to this double heterogeneity has been the development and enforcement of metadata (data about data)&lt;br/&gt;standards; in this response one tries to abstract data away from its organizational context in order to&lt;br/&gt;render it universally accessible. This project takes the opposite track, and seeks new ways of grounding&lt;br/&gt;environmental data in its organizational context in such a way that it can both be used more flexibly today&lt;br/&gt;and so it can retain its value longer. The hypothesis, based on the last 25 years of work in the field of&lt;br/&gt;Science Studies, is that formal data descriptions must be wrapped in informal descriptions in order to&lt;br/&gt;be useful. The informal description for short-lived data is provided by face-to-face contact, by&lt;br/&gt;exchanging graduate students, through conference papers and so forth. It is precisely this layer which is&lt;br/&gt;lost in highly distributed data collection efforts characteristic of biodiversity and ecosystem informatics; it&lt;br/&gt;is also this layer which is lost when data is wrapped in formal metadata and saved to disk. The goal of&lt;br/&gt;this project is to open up a major new field of database inquiry tied precisely to the specific problems of&lt;br/&gt;the biodiversity and ecosystems communities generated by their need for very long lasting and highly&lt;br/&gt;distributed data. The project will develop into a larger study of the articulation between metadata and&lt;br/&gt;narrative modes of wrapping data.</AbstractNarration>
