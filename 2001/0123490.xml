    <AbstractNarration>I propose to initiate an innovative, collaborative small grants program that fosters basic research by undergraduate and graduate students on fundamental questions related to plant conservation biology. With a third year of funding following on my NSF Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology Education, I will forge partnerships between my host institution, the New England Wild Flower Society (NEWFS), and academic centers in New England to establish a student research program addressing the ecology of rare plants, called the NSF/NEPCoP Fellows Program. During fall 2001, I will solicit research proposals from advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students from academic institutions in New England. I will fund six field research studies selected via peer-review and will advise these studies during summer, 2002. I will assist students in empirical design, data interpretation, and publication. Results from these studies will be published as appropriate in scientific journals, and promulgated to relevant conservation organizations to facilitate management of rare plant populations. &lt;br/&gt;This program will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Enable students to hone both strong empirical research skills and clear communication skills that will enhance their. Professional development and broaden their opportunities for employment; yield valuable new data to advance the science of conservation biology; fund opportunities for research in conservation biology not currently covered by grant sources; provide. Critically needed data on species biology to NEWFS and other conservation organizations to promote scientifically-based. Conservation efforts; serve as a self-sustaining model for collaboration among academic and extramural institutions to strengthen data collection efforts and to train a new generation of conservation biologists.</AbstractNarration>
