    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0104000&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Efstratia Kalfagianni&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study the ``finite type" invariants of knots and&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds by using techniques from classical 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology and search for geometric information encoded in these&lt;br/&gt;invariants. First, she will continue her work on developing the&lt;br/&gt;theory of finite type invariants for knots and links in arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds by using techniques from the theory of atoroidal&lt;br/&gt;decompositions of 3-manifolds. She also plans to work on&lt;br/&gt;relating the Vassiliev knot invariants to properties of Seifert&lt;br/&gt;surfaces spanned by the knots and to intrinsic invariants of the&lt;br/&gt;knot complement. This will extend classical results about the&lt;br/&gt;topology of the Alexander polynomial to the Jones polynomial and&lt;br/&gt;its generalizations. Finally, the PI plans to search for&lt;br/&gt;relations between the Jones polynomial of a knot and the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental group of 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on the&lt;br/&gt;knot.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of the project lies in the area of 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology the central objects of study of which are spaces called&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. A 3-manifold is an object that locally looks like&lt;br/&gt;the ordinary 3-dimensional space but whose global structure can&lt;br/&gt;be complicated. A main goal of 3-dimensional topology is to&lt;br/&gt;understand these structures and achieve a classification of&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds. An important part of 3-dimensional topology is also&lt;br/&gt;the study of knots (loops embedded in some tangled way in&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds) and their classification. One of the ways that&lt;br/&gt;topologists have been approaching these problems is through the&lt;br/&gt;use of ``invariants". In the recent years, ideas originated in&lt;br/&gt;physics, lead mathematicians to the discovery of a variety of&lt;br/&gt;invariants of knots and 3-manifolds. The central theme of the&lt;br/&gt;PI's project is to understand the properties of these invariants,&lt;br/&gt;using ideas from traditional 3-dimensional topology and from&lt;br/&gt;physics, and to look for applications to the aforementioned&lt;br/&gt;classification problems.</AbstractNarration>
