    <AbstractNarration>Plasma is a manufacturing medium with unique properties, and its use has led to more efficient processes and products that could not be fabricated without them. Yet, despite the importance of plasma-aided manufacturing, few community colleges currently offer courses and prepare technicians in this critical technology. To address this urgent need, the project is developing essential resources that will enable community colleges to implement plasma-aided manufacturing courses. These resources include outcomes- based instructional materials, training systems in plasma technology, and workshops for community college faculty. Outcomes-based instructional materials are organized around three fundamental components of a plasma processing system. These fundamental components include plasma physics, RF power subsystems, and gas delivery subsystems. Modules on plasma applications, e.g. plasma etch, chemical vapor deposition, and sputtering, integrate the three fundamental components into a capstone-type learning experience for students. Laboratory improvement will focus on the design of plasma training systems at RF frequencies. Project staff are working with equipment suppliers to adapt current manufacturing systems for community college laboratories. Finally, faculty enhancement workshops provide hands-on opportunities with plasma training systems and disseminate instructional materials developed through this project.</AbstractNarration>
