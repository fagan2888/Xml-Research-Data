    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0135910&lt;br/&gt;Fernando Torres-Gil, UCLA &lt;br/&gt;Partial travel support and conference preparation costs are requested for the participants at the workshop "Nanotechnology: Opportunities and Challenges for Industry" to be held at UCLA on September 10, 2001. The California NanoSystems Institute and the UCLA School of Public Policy and Social Research organize the workshop. The sponsors are the Department of Commerce, the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Nanotechnology Coordinating Office (NNCO), and the National Science Foundation (NSF). The workshop will bring together 70-80 leaders from industry, government, academia and financial community to explore the future of nanotechnology, the industry opportunities, and the ways to increase the pace of taking advantage of the new technology. This workshop is part of a series of workshops over the next 18 months in various regions of the country. The UCLA workshop will draw attendees from the Western U.S. predominantly with focus on importance of nanotechnology in three areas of application: aerospace, information technology/electronics, and biotechnology/medicine. The main objectives are: identifying the major technical challenges for application of nanotechnology in industry, scientific developments that could be exploited by industry, major obstacles in this developments, and networking among experts and organizations from various areas.</AbstractNarration>
