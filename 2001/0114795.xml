    <AbstractNarration>Determining the function of a network of genes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Definition of "determining the function"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In our project, we will define the function of approximately 10 new genes from Arabidopsis that are functionally related because they are part of the RPM1 disease resistance pathway. Our definition of function will entail:&lt;br/&gt;1. Detailed information on the role of these genes in disease resistance.&lt;br/&gt;2. Broader definition of extra functions that we may uncover for these genes. For example, we already know that reduction of function of at least two of them causes meristem defects. At present, this may be simple pleiotropy. It also may be relevant, meaning that the genes in question have additional functions in plant growth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;URLs where the public can get information on their accession numbers in GenBank or other identifiers in a publicly accessible database&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our data will be published and our results will also be available on our lab web site at:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/dangl/lab/superpage.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an example of how we release web based data, see:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.bio.unc.edu/faculty/dangl/lab/sar/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What, how and where the results will be shared&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will share our results well before publication at the annual Arabidopsis meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance of the proposed work in relation to the 2010 Project objectives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our work will dovetail with more general functional genomics proposals funded in 2010. It is necessary to incorporate hypothesis driven functional genomics results, such as the data we intend to generate, with the gene family and whole genome data generated by others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disease resistance is a significant problem in agriculture. We will add to the body of knowledge that will eventually lead to more effective control of plant disease. This is vital because we currently lose up to 30% of crop yield to pathogens and pests.</AbstractNarration>
