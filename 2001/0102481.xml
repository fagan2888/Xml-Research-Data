    <AbstractNarration>Chemical reactions that convert a solid oxide into new fluid and solid&lt;br/&gt;products with compositions that differ from the initial oxide are&lt;br/&gt;considered to be "incongruent" (e.g., incongruent melting, incongruent&lt;br/&gt;dissolution). While some types of incongruent reactions are well&lt;br/&gt;understood, the basic kinetic mechanisms by which oxides undergo&lt;br/&gt;"incongruent reduction" with molten metals are not. The objective of this&lt;br/&gt;research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the kinetic&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms (rate-limiting steps, microstructural evolution) by which a&lt;br/&gt;solid oxide undergoes incongruent reduction with a reactive metallic&lt;br/&gt;liquid. In this work, the incongruent reduction of aluminum oxide in&lt;br/&gt;contact with Mg-Al liquids (which involves the formation of solid magnesium&lt;br/&gt;aluminate spinel) will be examined. Novel experiments with in-situ x-ray&lt;br/&gt;diffraction will be used to track, in real time, the formation of spinel on&lt;br/&gt;alumina surfaces immersed under molten Mg-Al layers. The kinetics of&lt;br/&gt;alumina weight change upon immersion in Mg-Al melts will also be studied&lt;br/&gt;under steady-state conditions. These kinetic measurements (phase change,&lt;br/&gt;mass change) will be used along with microchemical and microstructural&lt;br/&gt;analyses of the alumina/melt interface to identify the rate-limiting&lt;br/&gt;step(s) of incongruent alumina reduction.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The rate of reaction between ceramics and liquid metals is of vital&lt;br/&gt;importance for a number of advanced technologies, such as: 1) novel,&lt;br/&gt;low-cost, reactive infiltration processing of ceramic/metal composites for&lt;br/&gt;automotive applications (e.g., cylinder liners, brake components, bearing&lt;br/&gt;sleeves), and 2) investment casting of advanced titanium alloys for&lt;br/&gt;lightweight and strong structural components in aircraft. The purpose of&lt;br/&gt;this research project is to develop a better fundamental understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the mechanisms of reactions between solid ceramics and liquid metals, so&lt;br/&gt;that the rate of such reactions can be better predicted and controlled.&lt;br/&gt;This research will involve the use of state-of-the-art analytical equipment&lt;br/&gt;to track the progress of such reactions in real time at interfaces between&lt;br/&gt;solid ceramics and liquid metals.</AbstractNarration>
