    <AbstractNarration>Technical changes to agriculture in Africa have long been promoted and introduced with the aim of improving food security in the region. The results of recent research on the relationship between technology transfer and agricultural production in Africa south of the Sahara are, however, inconsistent at best, indicating the need for new conceptualizations of the problem. This project examines changes to rice production systems in Ivory Coast in the context of the neo-liberal reforms of the 1990s in order to determine the conditions under which rice growers have responded positively to the new policies. The research will test three main hypotheses:(1) that the reforms have had little impact on national rice output but that they have affected regional market orientation of rice production; (2) that farmer-led innovations can be expected in commercial rice systems but that the macro-level economic reforms will have had little impact on the regional rice cropping patterns; and (3) where small-scale milling operations provide a market outlet for rice producers, positive farmer response to the reforms will be greatest. The research will include a mix of techniques involving both qualitative and quantitative information. The methods to conduct this study include establishing accurate information on current rice production and area from data provided by local extension service offices throughout the country and interviews with local extension workers responsible for rice, rice farmers, millers, and traders. From these updated data, the project will use survey research techniques in selected villages using a farming systems approach and in selected urban milling and marketing centers using a commodity chain analysis approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to debates on the role of technology transfer and market incentives to stimulate production, and in particular on the potential role of intermediary regional commodity chains in the development and diffusion of agricultural technology. This research will be of value to social scientists, applied agricultural researcher, and policymakers.</AbstractNarration>
