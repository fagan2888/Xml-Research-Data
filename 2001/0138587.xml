    <AbstractNarration>The project "CourseMap: On-line Course to Enhance Precollege Mathematics Teaching" proposes to create and disseminate a new set of on-line teacher development courses to enhance the skills and subject-matter understanding needed in our nation's mathematics classrooms. Over the proposal two-year period the PIs plan to create 8 one-credit-hour graduate courses, four at the middle school level and four at the high school level. Understanding that the distinction between content and methods can be artifical, they intend that all methods courses will reinforce important new content, and similarly, the presentation of content courses will model best pedagogical pratice. Consequently, there will be significant integration of the standards-based content and methodologies across the courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed project looks at new and emerging technologies to begin to address these concerns, with a team of some of the most prominent mathematics educators in the country. More specifically, the design and production teams comprise leading mathematics, educators, technology specialists and instructional video specialists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, Teachers College Columbia will offer the courses for graduate credit, with Lesson Labs to provide an authoring system, and with WebCT to provide expertise in course management and on-line community building, as well as to promote and host the courses. Their goal is to reach the largest possible in-service teacher audience.</AbstractNarration>
