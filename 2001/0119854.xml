    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Our Ocean: Enhancing Minority Education in the Marine Sciences at a Caribbean HBCU&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is conducted by faculty in the Marine Sciences at the University of the Virgin Islands (UVI), a predominantly undergraduate, Historically Black university with campuses on the islands of St. Thomas and St. Croix. &lt;br/&gt;The project takes advantage of the strengths of UVI-the accessible tropical marine environment of the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, high academic standards, and a strong track record of preparing minority undergraduates for postgraduate study in the sciences. The program works synergistically with other programs, including an NSF Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program cooperative agreement (HRD-9979896) to address the education, economic, and cultural barriers to entry into the marine sciences that Virgin Islanders face. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project increases the number of minority Virgin Islanders entering into the marine sciences at the undergraduate and graduate levels by reducing educational, economic, and cultural barriers to entry and retention. Specific activities supporting this goal include: enhancing the interest and preparation in the marine sciences of minority high school students through a six-week, on-campus summer enrichment activity; increasing enrollment and retention in UVI's Marine Biology BS curriculum by providing one new 4-year tuition scholarship to a minority Virgin Island student each year for 3 years; strengthening preparation for post-baccalaureate study and/or careers in marine sciences by supporting mentored undergraduate research projects per semester for three years; and developing programs to increase awareness and interest in marine fields.</AbstractNarration>
