    <AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative research award under the Information Technology Research initiative. The collaborator (DMR-0113172) is Professor L. Sun at the University of Iowa. The research involves the development and application of methods for large-scale dislocation dynamics simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of recent progress in manufacturing and engineering utilization of nano-and micro-scale structures, there is an urgent need for approaches that are capable of predicting the reliability and propensity of these structures to failure. This grant will develop Fortran 90/95 parallel computer software, based on discrete dislocation dynamics, which will predict plastic deformation and failure of sub-micron semiconductor microelectronics. Developed software will be aimed at (1) design of desired mechanical properties of semiconductor thin film-substrate material systems for optimum reliability; (2) development of new computer architectures for parallel, large-scale simulations for the dynamics of topologically complex line defects, which interact through long-range force fields; and (3) enhanced education training of graduate and undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following projects will be undertaken: (1) Investigation of single and collective dislocation interaction phenomena in anisotropic materials, which determine plasticity and failure in semiconductor devices; (2) Multiscale coupling of parametric dislocation dynamics with the finite element and analytical elasticity methods; (3) Development of unique software on parallel, scalable computer clusters to simulate the collective behavior of topologically complex line defects, which interact with a long-range force field; (4) Application of the developed software to investigate a number of critical physical mechanisms, including, misfit and threading dislocation loop motion; dislocation-dislocation interactions; junction and jog formation; dislocation annihilation and multiplication; dislocation interaction with grain boundaries, free surfaces and bimaterial elastic interfaces; dislocation interactions with point defects, precipitates and cracks; influence of thermal residual stress; computational design of buffer layers and superlattices; and (5) Large-scale simulation and optimization of semiconductor systems to provide guidelines for engineering design of new generations of microelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will improve our understanding of plastic flow and failure at the nano-to-meso scale and represents a challenge to high performance computing and protocols. Models will be compared to experimental data and will also be used to design reliable microelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative research award under the Information Technology Research initiative.
