    <AbstractNarration>0111170&lt;br/&gt;Roundhill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project supports a collaborative project between Dr. D.M. Roundhill, Department of Chemistry, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas and Dr. Mustafa Yilmaz, Department of Chemistry, Selcuk University, Konya, Turkey. The focus of the collaboration is the synthesis of new chemically modified calixarenes, and their use as liquid-liquid phase extractants for heavy metal ions. In particular, metal ions will be targeted that are presently causing environmental problems. The researchers plan to study calixarene-based receptors designed for heavy metal clean up applications. The work includes the generation of new ionophore polymer systems with specific binding strategies for Cs+ and selected cations and anions. Specifically the calixarene known as calixcrown-6 polymer will be synthesized and incorporated into copolymer resins. The material thus derived will be characterized, and will be used in liquid-liquid extractions with equal volume mixtures of metal and extractant analyzed for aqueous phase metals. The solid-liquid extraction will be determined by batchwise column methods. The plan of work involves three sequential components: synthesis of ionophores, characterization of ionophores and extraction studies that will assess the ability of the ionophores to extract metal ions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The project supports collaboration between two well-known scientists who have complementary expertise and resources to investigate an important material and environmental problem. There are substantial environmental implications of the research, as it may lead to new and improved means for decontamination of heavy metal polluted sites. Both groups have independently studied the complexation of metal ions by calixarenes and both will conduct research on liquid phase extractants of heavy metals with the use of calixarene modified polymers. Dr. Yilmaz is a synthetic organic chemist with extensive experience in calixarene chemistry, and Dr. Roundhill is an inorganic chemist who has considerable knowledge of the complexation chemistry of heavy metal ions. The proposed collaborative effort will establish stronger international ties and provide scientific benefits. This project meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.</AbstractNarration>
