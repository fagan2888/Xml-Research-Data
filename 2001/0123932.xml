    <AbstractNarration>CMS-0123932&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of this symposium is to bring together, engineers, scientists and applied mathematicians from a variety of scientific disciplines who are working on duality, Complementarity and symmetry in nonlinear mechanics and computational methods. The original proposal of this IUTAM symposium has been approved by the IUTAM Symposia Committee with the maximum grade A. The purpose of this proposal is to apply for a very limit grant from NSF to cover partially the travel expenses for about ten important participants from different institutions in US. The symposium proceedings will be published in a hardbound volume by Chapman &amp; Hall / CRC in the book series Advances in Modern Mechanics and Mathematics. It is expected that this IUTAM Symposium will lead a new trend of nonlinear mechanics, and the proceedings will be an important IUTAM documentation in the development of this fascinating subject.</AbstractNarration>
