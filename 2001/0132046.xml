    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project describes the development of a Capillary Breakup Rheometer (CaBER) from a proven breadboard design to a commercially viable instrument for both analytical and process control functions. In this document the results of the successful completion of a Phase I SBIR are outlined. The fundamental operation of the CaBER's component parts is supported by data that validates the chosen components and verifies the suitability of the design. In addition, sample data from model fluids will be used to both illustrate the functionality of the CaBER and to highlight the broad applicability of the instrument. Ongoing developments of the CaBER include more robust software analysis, cheaper manufacturing costs and a more intuitive user interface. These improvements will result in an instrument that is invaluable to industry in both a research laboratory and a process control environment. &lt;br/&gt; Currently there is only one commercially available extensional rheometer and a handful of academic rheometer designs. By providing a virtually unique tool for the determination of extensional viscosity in a freely draining fluid thread, this instrument will fill a segment of the instrumentation field that as here to fore been neglected.</AbstractNarration>
