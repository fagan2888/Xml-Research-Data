    <AbstractNarration>0107812&lt;br/&gt;Gremaud&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the Southeast Conference on Applied &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics (SECAM). The conference will focus on four overlapping &lt;br/&gt;themes: i) Mathematical Methods for Multiscale Problems, ii) Industrial &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, iii) Mathematical and Computational Biology, and iv) &lt;br/&gt;Material Science. Multiscaled models are found in a wide range of &lt;br/&gt;applications and pose difficulties for both mathematical and numerical &lt;br/&gt;analysis. What is, for instance, the effect of the fine scale behavior on the &lt;br/&gt;solutions? How well should the fine scales be resolved to obtain accurate &lt;br/&gt;information? etc. The problems to be discussed in Industrial Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;come from areas such as microelectronic, chemical manufacturing and &lt;br/&gt;material processing, and will focus on the process of technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;The extreme complexity of the problems studied in Mathematical Biology &lt;br/&gt;precludes a traditional "pencil and paper" approach and calls rather for an &lt;br/&gt;integrated approach between mathematical modeling and computer &lt;br/&gt;analyses. This trend has been accelerated by the development of &lt;br/&gt;productive partnerships between experimentalists, theoreticians and &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians with similar interests but very different areas of expertise. &lt;br/&gt;Successful examples will be discussed. The study of emerging &lt;br/&gt;applications in the Material Sciences such as granular flows, thin films or &lt;br/&gt;smart materials has led to the discovery of new kind of instabilities and &lt;br/&gt;interface propagation problems. This session will aim at facilitating the &lt;br/&gt;migration of the most successful analysis and computational techniques &lt;br/&gt;from specific areas of Material Science to other problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference aims at accomplishing three main goals: Interaction, &lt;br/&gt;Showcase, and New Activities. Interaction: The conference will provide a &lt;br/&gt;forum and gathering place for applied mathematicians in the Southeast. It &lt;br/&gt;will reach out to several groups that are underrepresented in traditional &lt;br/&gt;meetings. First, many successful collaborations have been established &lt;br/&gt;between applied mathematicians and scientists from local companies and &lt;br/&gt;governmental laboratories in technological parks such as Research &lt;br/&gt;Triangle Park, NC. Several industrial partners have been invited to give &lt;br/&gt;presentations. Second, there are emerging centers of excellence within the &lt;br/&gt;many local colleges and historically black institutions. Speakers and &lt;br/&gt;students from such institution have been invited to contribute to the &lt;br/&gt;success of the conference. Showcase: The high level of activity in Applied &lt;br/&gt;and Industrial Mathematics is not always accurately represented through &lt;br/&gt;the usual channels of communication. Indeed, by its very nature, a sizable &lt;br/&gt;part of the work done in Industrial Mathematics gets to be published in &lt;br/&gt;specialized engineering type journals, reaching only a small portion of the &lt;br/&gt;Applied Mathematics community. Conferences such as this one can play a &lt;br/&gt;fundamental role in unifying and improving approaches that may be &lt;br/&gt;similar in many aspects but are used in very distinct applications. Special &lt;br/&gt;care has been taken to provide younger scientists and graduate students &lt;br/&gt;with the opportunity to present their work and take an active part in the &lt;br/&gt;conference. New activities: The audience is expected to span a whole &lt;br/&gt;spectrum of expertise, experience and background, from recognized &lt;br/&gt;researchers in academia to engineers from the private sector and national &lt;br/&gt;research laboratories to students and people with limited research &lt;br/&gt;experience in Applied Mathematics. It is expected that not only will the &lt;br/&gt;conference give an accurate idea of significant ongoing and future trends &lt;br/&gt;in Applied Mathematics, but also will lead to new collaborations and &lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
