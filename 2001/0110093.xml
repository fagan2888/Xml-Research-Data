    <AbstractNarration>Force-induced conformational transitions in single polysaccharide molecules by AFM&lt;br/&gt;Pyranose ring-based molecules are of extraordinary importance to biological systems (e.g.&lt;br/&gt;glucose). Many biologically important polysaccharides are composed of pyranose rings and they&lt;br/&gt;are placed under tensile stress in a wide variety of cellular structures such as the cell wall of&lt;br/&gt;plants or the extracellular matrix (ECM) in animal tissues. Mechanical stress is thought to&lt;br/&gt;regulate assembly and physiological properties of these complex elastic systems. The&lt;br/&gt;polysaccharides respond to that stress by mechanical rearrangements of their components but&lt;br/&gt;the underlying mechanism is not well understood. The simplest view assumes that&lt;br/&gt;polysaccharides are entropic springs and the pyranose ring structure is typically portrayed as&lt;br/&gt;inelastic and locked into a stable conformation. The development of single molecule AFM&lt;br/&gt;techniques allowed for critically examining these views. AFM instruments can stretch&lt;br/&gt;mechanically single molecules and have superb length and force resolution. Stretching of&lt;br/&gt;polysaccharides by AFM revealed that they do not behave as simple entropic springs but that&lt;br/&gt;they display yielding phenomena. The origin of these elastic deviations was pinpointed to the&lt;br/&gt;pyranose ring that was found to undergo, upon stretching, conformational transitions such as&lt;br/&gt;chair-boat or chair inversion. These forced transitions change, in a step-wise fashion, the&lt;br/&gt;separation of the glycosidic oxygen atoms, and therefore affect the contour length of the&lt;br/&gt;polysaccharide chain and its elasticity. Axial glycosidic bonds were found to drive those&lt;br/&gt;transitions by acting as atomic levers. The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand,&lt;br/&gt;at the atomic level, the mechanism of these force-induced conformational transitions in&lt;br/&gt;polysaccharides. During the second grant period single molecule AFM techniques will be&lt;br/&gt;combined with the tools of computational chemistry to examine in detail force-induced&lt;br/&gt;conformational transitions in the pyranose ring. The mechanical properties of the ring and its&lt;br/&gt;mechanical conformational transitions will be probed by pulling on the ring from various&lt;br/&gt;directions and by different attachment points. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These studies will determine the contribution of each type of the monomer to the&lt;br/&gt;complex elasticity of a mixed chain and will be valuable in interpreting the molecular elasticity of&lt;br/&gt;many native polysaccharides. The experimental and theoretical findings of this proposal will be&lt;br/&gt;integrated to develop an AFM-based methodology for identifying individual polysaccharide&lt;br/&gt;molecules in solution from their unique force-extension spectra. Such a methodology will be an&lt;br/&gt;important addition to the arsenal of analytical tools for carbohydrate research.</AbstractNarration>
