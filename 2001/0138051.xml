    <AbstractNarration>0138051&lt;br/&gt;Mazumdar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports the US-India cooperative research project entitled Theory of Pi-Conjugated Photonic Materials. The investigators, Sumitendra Mazumdar, University of Arizona and Suryanarayana Ramasesha, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore will undertake theoretical studies on the photophysics of pi-conjugated oligomers and polymers. These materials are of high current interest for their applications in photonics. The PIs will study the optical properties of conjugated organic polymer materials with a focus on interpreting experimental results, developing mechanisms for photophysical processes, and predicting optical properties of new materials. The goals are to develop a comprehensive theory of charge-transfer and collision processes important in organic light emitting diodes and to develop a density matrix renormalization technique capable of calculating energies of low band gap polymers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project extends research funded under grant, DMR-0101659 to Mazumdar and continues a highly successful collaboration with Ramasesha. Their work on organic light emitting diodes was published in Nature this year. The PI is a leading theorist in the area of excited states and optical properties of conjugated polymers. The research is expected to lead to greater understanding of correlated electron physics and to significant advances in the development of new concepts and methodologies for organic semiconductors and low dimensional correlated electron systems. Due to the technological importance of the materials and methodologies under study, this research is likely to strongly impact the development of this rapidly evolving field over the next few years. It extends DMR funded research and provides mutual benefits to students and junior colleagues in both countries. The project is supported by the Office of International Science &amp; Engineering and the Division of Materials Research. In India, it is supported by the Department of Science and Technology.</AbstractNarration>
