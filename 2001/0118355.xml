    <AbstractNarration>This project proposed by the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) will collect and&lt;br/&gt;analyze data from sample surveys and data systems towards three goals: (1) evaluate the quality of initial&lt;br/&gt;preparation and professional development of math and science teachers in the nation and by state, and&lt;br/&gt;assess trends toward improved preparation, (2) assess change in the quality of teaching practices being&lt;br/&gt;used in schools in relation to science and math education standards, and (3) establish a web-based system&lt;br/&gt;for collecting data and evaluating the quality of professional development activities with science and&lt;br/&gt;math teachers, using criteria based on recent research on quality programs. This will be led by CCSSO with assistance from an expert panel, and a subcontractor organization, Wisconsin Center for Education Research (WCER).</AbstractNarration>
