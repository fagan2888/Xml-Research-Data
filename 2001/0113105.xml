    <AbstractNarration>The phenomenal growth of the World Wide Web has resulted in the emergence&lt;br/&gt;and popularity of several new information technology related computer&lt;br/&gt;applications. The emerging computer workloads involve the integration&lt;br/&gt;of a variety of software, protocols, and standards: GUIs, Java, CORBA, &lt;br/&gt;cgi, perl, TCP/IP, HTTP, and HTML are just a few of them. Facilitating&lt;br/&gt;smooth use of the internet for emerging applications involves designing&lt;br/&gt;efficient computer systems and microprocessors for use in the computers&lt;br/&gt;that serve these applications. Most of these workloads are just emerging,&lt;br/&gt;and their behavior is not well-understood by computer designers and&lt;br/&gt;architects. Many of the microprocessors that run these applications were&lt;br/&gt;designed before the advent of these workloads.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research consists of understanding emerging workloads of the&lt;br/&gt;Information Technology era and designing microprocessors and computer&lt;br/&gt;systems for their efficient execution. It involves identifying where the&lt;br/&gt;cycles are gone during execution of these workloads, and identifying&lt;br/&gt;sources of loss of performance. The study will pin point bottlenecks, and&lt;br/&gt;identify architectural enhancements to improve performance. The&lt;br/&gt;performance monitoring counters present on commercial processors will be&lt;br/&gt;used for the first level of characterization followed by detailed complete&lt;br/&gt;system simulations for analyzing design tradeoffs. The proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will be conducted in close collaboration with our industrial partners,&lt;br/&gt;IBM, Tivoli, Intel and AMD. The project will serve as an integral part of&lt;br/&gt;a long term, comprehensive research program to influence the design of&lt;br/&gt;microprocessors and computer systems for the information technology era.</AbstractNarration>
