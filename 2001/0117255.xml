    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0117255&lt;br/&gt;Robert E. Hiromoto&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas - San Antonio&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Experiences in High-Performance Computing and Communications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, our goals are to (1) strengthen our ability to attract and retain undergraduate and graduate minority students, (2) increase the numbers of talented undergraduate minority students pursuing graduate education and high-tech industrial careers, (3) enhance the research productivity of the faculty and students, and (4) provide valuable industry experience to these students through industrial internships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to create a dual-mentor partnership program with local industry to enhance the linkage of research and high-tech opportunities for our students. Students selected for this program will participate as NSF student scholars and will be provided financial support in the form of scholarships and research assistantships. Students will be expected to collaborate with a faculty mentor and regional industry research partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty from the Computer Science Department and the College of Engineering, will provide undergraduate student mentoring, work to develop student skills in problem solving activities, and create student research collaborations with faculty and industry. The research strengths in CS alone include: 1) parallel and distributed computing; 2) compiler technology for internet and parallel computing; 3) computer network protocols; 4) network security; 5) high-speed switching architectures; 6) data mining; and 7) biocomputing.</AbstractNarration>
