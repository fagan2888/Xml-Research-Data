    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Adaptation of Bluetooth Technology for Wireless Sensing Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we are proposing to develop the communication interface that will allow microsensors such Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors to transfer sensor data to a Bluetooth communication module for wireless data telemetry to a remote computer. Wireless transmission of sensor data will be compared with direct acquisition of sensor data using traditional wired methods. Since line of sight communication is not required in such systems, studies will be conducted to assess data transmission capabilities from within a variety of enclosures made of different materials. Lithium Niobate SAW devices operating at three different frequencies will be acquired for this purpose. They can serve as very good temperature sensors. All three sensors will be operated simultaneously in close proximity to verify sensor identification capability of the communication system. This proof of concept system is expected to serve as foundational work for the wide use of this technology for a variety of sensor systems including SAW and MEMS sensors. One graduate student and one undergraduate student will be supported on the project.</AbstractNarration>
