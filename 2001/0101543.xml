    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to use equivariant methods to study&lt;br/&gt;problems concerning algebraic varieties with group actions. Part&lt;br/&gt;of this project involves moment graphs of varieties with torus&lt;br/&gt;actions. For a variety on which a torus acts with finitely many&lt;br/&gt;fixed points and curves, one can define a combinatorial object&lt;br/&gt;called a moment graph. There has been much recent progress in&lt;br/&gt;computing topological invariants, such as cohomology or&lt;br/&gt;intersection homology, in terms of the moment graph. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator proposes to extend this to K-theory. Schubert&lt;br/&gt;varieties are among the most important varieties with this type of&lt;br/&gt;torus action; the investigator plans to continue work with Brian&lt;br/&gt;Boe on a conjecture that would simplify determining if a point in&lt;br/&gt;a Schubert variety is rationally smooth. Moreover, he plans to&lt;br/&gt;extend some facts known only for Schubert varieties to the more&lt;br/&gt;general setting of varieties with this type of torus action. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the investigator plans to use equivariant methods to&lt;br/&gt;study certain interesting varieties: he plans to calculate&lt;br/&gt;Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson classes of degeneracy loci, and to&lt;br/&gt;calculate interesting invariants (degrees, push-forward measures)&lt;br/&gt;of nilpotent adjoint orbits of reductive Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in the area of mathematics referred to as&lt;br/&gt;"algebraic geometry." Algebraic geometry studies geometric&lt;br/&gt;objects by describing them as solutions to polynomial equations&lt;br/&gt;-- such objects are called "algebraic varieties." Fortunately,&lt;br/&gt;although algebraic varieties can be very complicated, many of&lt;br/&gt;them have a great deal of symmetry. Mathematicians have been&lt;br/&gt;intensely investigating such varieties with extra symmetry for&lt;br/&gt;several reasons: The presence of such extra symmetry makes&lt;br/&gt;these varieties easier to study, so that these varieties are&lt;br/&gt;valuable test cases in developing methods to investigate all&lt;br/&gt;varieties. Moreover, varieties with extra symmetry are of great&lt;br/&gt;interest in their own right: they play important roles in&lt;br/&gt;various areas of mathematics, including number theory,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, and representation theory. There has been&lt;br/&gt;considerable recent progress in developing techniques to&lt;br/&gt;understand these kinds of varieties; this project is about&lt;br/&gt;extending these techniques, and using them to study particular&lt;br/&gt;classes of varieties.</AbstractNarration>
