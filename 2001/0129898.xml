    <AbstractNarration>Systemic Research, Inc. proposes to conduct a 24-month evaluative study (from October 2001 to&lt;br/&gt;September 2003). During the initial phase, comprehensive secondary data collection will be conducted from various sources, including past Core Data Elements (CDE) reports, Annual Reports submitted to&lt;br/&gt;NSF, other key indicators obtainable from the RSIs' own web sites and relevant rural project reports.&lt;br/&gt;Systemic Research will develop a Rural Key Indicator Database (RKID) to organize both quantitative and&lt;br/&gt;qualitative longitudinal achievement databases over the project period of individual RSI sites. The study&lt;br/&gt;team will conduct two site visits each year to confirm reform implementation and to write relevant case&lt;br/&gt;stories based on observation. Based on completed RKID, both quantitative and qualitative data analysis will be performed to explore an inferential causal model. Study results will be disseminated in three&lt;br/&gt;publications: a two volume Rural Key Indicators of Science and Mathematics Education (Volume I for&lt;br/&gt;individual RSI progress report and Volume II for overall RSI progress reports); a rural education report in&lt;br/&gt;booklet format; and a RSI Evaluative Study Report including case stories of the four sites that were&lt;br/&gt;visited. All publications will be available in three different formats-- printed copy, CD-ROM, and web-based&lt;br/&gt;publication.</AbstractNarration>
