    <AbstractNarration>The University of Idaho Physics Department will host seven undergraduate physics students annually for a ten-week summer research experience. These students will closely work with Idaho faculty members and subsequently present their research project results at an appropriate venue (e.g. National Conference on Undergraduate Research). The objectives of this program are: (1) to introduce undergraduate physics majors to the excitement of physics research, (2) to train these students in the laboratory skills needed in modern physics research, (3) to foster student personal growth by having the students work in teams and by teaching them the ethical dimension of scientific research, and (4) to promote diversity in the field of physics by encouraging applicants and participants from under-represented groups. The Idaho physics faculty will design research projects that are challenging yet viable. The areas of research in the department that will be represented are condensed matter physics, plasma physics, astrophysics, and nuclear physics. Both theoretical and experimental projects will be made available. The students will be encouraged to work in small groups to foster teamwork skills. Weekly meetings will be held to allow the students to interact and to keep each other posted on their progress. The REU students will interact with Idaho faculty, research staff personnel, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students and undergraduates. Weekend activities will take place that revolve around the tremendous outdoor experiences available in Idaho. A targeted recruiting plan will be undertaken. Particular attention will be given to recruiting from institutions with significant populations of students from traditionally under-represented groups. The program presented herein will benefit the REU participants by allowing them to learn and grow in an active research environment and will also benefit the Idaho physics department by bringing bright, enthusiastic researchers from around the country into our department.</AbstractNarration>
