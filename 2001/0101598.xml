    <AbstractNarration>The Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC), the largest provider of IT training in Maryland, is collaborating with other organizations to implement an associate degree program in e-commerce and two related certificate programs for "Building E-Commerce Solutions for Organizations" and "Managing E-Commerce Enterprises." Partners include the Maryland State Department of Education, the University of Baltimore's Department of Business and Economic Development, the University of Maryland University College, the Maryland Community College Teleconsortium, the Baltimore County Career and Technology Education Division, the Next Generation Internet Company, Paragon Computer Services, Circadian Management Corporation, Delata Graphics and Communications, Vansant Creations, and the Maryland Online Network. The project builds on course work developed under NSF Award No. 9950056, "Internet and Multimedia Technology (I/MMT): Curriculum, Faculty, and Workforce Development," and also builds on the IT skill standards developed by the NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies, an ATE Center of Excellence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important part of this project is the development and validation of skill standards needed to define the specific skill sets, performance indicators, employability skills, and technical knowledge required of technician-level workers in e-commerce in the region. The resulting degree and certificate programs aim to prepare students for entry-level employment, provide opportunities for workers to upgrade and acquire technical skills, and prepare students for further education in articulated four-year programs. Students in the new programs have access to two delivery options for their courses: the Internet and the classroom. Project faculty are obtaining professional development through graduate studies and internships. Workshops are upgrading K-12 teachers' skills. An annual professional development conference brings together K-12 and college faculty and industry representatives to address ongoing changes in the field. Finally, the project is employing an Internet-supported process to survey business leaders in e-commerce, in order to access business expertise, maintain the currency of the skill standards information, and regularly update the curriculum. Business and educational partners are supporting the program as advisory board members, in program development, and for internships and cooperative education opportunities for faculty and students.</AbstractNarration>
