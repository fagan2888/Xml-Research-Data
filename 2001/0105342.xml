    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0105342&lt;br/&gt;Alexandru I. Suciu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is centered around a topological study&lt;br/&gt;of complex hyperplane arrangements, with a view towards&lt;br/&gt;finding effectively computable invariants of their complements.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to decide whether a given invariant is&lt;br/&gt;combinatorially determined, and, if it is, to express&lt;br/&gt;it explicitly in terms of the intersection lattice of&lt;br/&gt;the arrangement. An important role is played by the&lt;br/&gt;jumping loci for cohomology with coefficients in local&lt;br/&gt;systems, and the related resonance varieties.&lt;br/&gt;These varieties have emerged as a central object of study.&lt;br/&gt;They provide deep information about the homotopy theory&lt;br/&gt;of the complement of an arrangement, as well as&lt;br/&gt;a bridge relating various invariants, in often unexpected ways.&lt;br/&gt;Another key role is played by the rational-homotopy&lt;br/&gt;notion of formality, which provides the underlying&lt;br/&gt;explanation for many of the encountered phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;Whenever possible, the study is done in a more general setting,&lt;br/&gt;which includes certain types of subspace arrangements,&lt;br/&gt;both real and complex, as well as certain links in the 3-sphere.&lt;br/&gt;Such a point of view enlarges the range of applicability of the&lt;br/&gt;results, and helps explain what is really peculiar to complex&lt;br/&gt;hyperplane arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its simplest manifestation, an arrangement is a&lt;br/&gt;finite collection of lines in the plane. These lines&lt;br/&gt;cut the plane into components, and understanding the topology&lt;br/&gt;of the complement amounts to counting those components.&lt;br/&gt;In the case of lines in the complex plane (or, for that&lt;br/&gt;matter, hyperplanes in complex n-space), the complement&lt;br/&gt;is connected, and its topology (as reflected, for example,&lt;br/&gt;in its homotopy groups) is much more interesting.&lt;br/&gt;The theory of arrangements is a relatively new branch&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics, started in the 1960's with a study&lt;br/&gt;of the classifying space for the pure braid group.&lt;br/&gt;The theory has developed at the interface between&lt;br/&gt;topology, algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;Hyperplane arrangements, and the closely related&lt;br/&gt;configuration spaces, are used in numerous areas,&lt;br/&gt;including robotics, multi-dimensional billiards,&lt;br/&gt;graphics, molecular biology, computer vision, and&lt;br/&gt;databases for representing the space of all possible&lt;br/&gt;states of a system characterized by many degrees&lt;br/&gt;of freedom. There are also deep connections between&lt;br/&gt;hyperplane arrangements, knot theory, hypergeometric&lt;br/&gt;functions, conformal field theory, and quantum cohomology.</AbstractNarration>
