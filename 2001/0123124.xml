    <AbstractNarration>Summary&lt;br/&gt;Building the Technology Workforce in Indiana: Undergraduate Scholarships in Information Technology, Computer Science, and Electronic and Computer Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides thirty-two scholarships to academically talented low-income students enrolled in a newly created Information Technology degree program, or in existing and highly regarded programs in Computer Science, and Electronic and Computer Technology. As part of the program, scholars are embraced in a unique First Year learning community designed to provide academic and social support to ensure their continued success toward their degree and in the university environment. Faculty advisor/mentors build relationships with the scholars, providing critical support as they monitor and guide. Internships with high tech industry partners offer scholars valuable career related experiences. Placement of graduating scholars in the workplace is facilitated through workshops and individual assistance. The program incorporates a wide range of student support services aimed to improve scholarship, retention to graduation, and successful employment in appropriate high technology careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.:&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME:&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:&lt;br/&gt;NSF RECEIVED DATE:&lt;br/&gt;0123124&lt;br/&gt;Easton, Richard&lt;br/&gt;Indiana State University&lt;br/&gt;Building the Technology Workforce in Indiana: NSF Undergraduate Scholarships in Information Technology, Computer Science, MIS, and Electronic and Compu&lt;br/&gt;05/01/2001</AbstractNarration>
