    <AbstractNarration>This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs (OPP) of the National Science Foundation (NSF), provides support for a workshop designed to initiate discussion about future scientific objectives and technical needs of the Antarctic marine geology and geophysics community. It has been about a decade since the community last took a focused look at the long-range science goals and needs for Antarctic marine geology and so a new perspective is needed. The present need for such a dialogue is also based on the timing of the lease schedule for the current ship support to the US Antarctic Research Program. Although ship support for Antarctic science is contracted for several more years, the process of developing scientific requirements as planning input for ship support beyond this period takes a considerable amount of time and so must begin soon. Consequently, within the next year, a document outlining the anticipated future scientific goals and objectives, in a broad fashion, and describing the specific technical needs for marine geologic and geophysical work in the Southern Ocean must be available for proper planning. The report produced from this workshop will serve as this planning document and will be available as a hard copy and on the Internet. The workshop will be held during Spring of 2002, in Washington, D.C. The meeting will be advertised via e-mail and through EOS, so that all interested individuals will have the opportunity to attend.</AbstractNarration>
