    <AbstractNarration>The design of efficient wireless communication systems relies on a&lt;br/&gt;deep understanding of the basic characteristics of the underlying&lt;br/&gt;channel. The most fundamental and unique characteristic of wireless&lt;br/&gt;channels is the random time-variation of the channel strengths, a&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon known as fading. Communication over fading channels has&lt;br/&gt;been a topic of study since the 60's. A very different view of the&lt;br/&gt;problem, however, emerges from recent research. The traditional view&lt;br/&gt;of fading is that it is a source of unreliability that has to be&lt;br/&gt;compensated for by various diversity techniques. The modern view is&lt;br/&gt;much more&lt;br/&gt;powerful and considers fading as a source of randomization from nature&lt;br/&gt;that can be exploited to get very significant capacity boost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project addresses several key problems within this&lt;br/&gt;modern paradigm. They will be centered around two areas: 1)&lt;br/&gt;opportunistic communication : the dynamic rate and power allocation&lt;br/&gt;over the dimensions of time, frequency, antennas and users&lt;br/&gt;so that transmission is done when and where the channel is strong;&lt;br/&gt;2) multi-antenna communication: the use of multiple transmit and&lt;br/&gt;receive antennas to increase the number of degrees of freedom available&lt;br/&gt;for communication in richly scattered fading environments. The issues&lt;br/&gt;studied are focused on how the random fading can be exploited even in&lt;br/&gt;the face of&lt;br/&gt;channel uncertainty, and the interplay between the modern and&lt;br/&gt;traditional views of channel fading.</AbstractNarration>
