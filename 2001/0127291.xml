    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing a complete Linked and Layered Resource for Collaborative, Technology-Based Learning in Physical Chemistry. The resource, Quantum States of Atoms and Molecules, is grounded in progressive pedagogical methods, uses appropriate computer technology, and makes firm connections between fundamental principles, physical reality, physical models, and mathematical descriptions of reality and the models. The resource would be unconventional in both form and structure. It is designed to engage students in the process of learning and help them develop skills in information processing, critical thinking and problem solving. It also takes advantage of existing knowledge on how adults and young adults learn. The product would consist of two parts: an inexpensive soft-cover text and a comprehensive multimedia CD. The text would present the core concepts linked to spectroscopy in an easy to understand prose style. The entire text would be on the CD with active hyperlinks to web and computer-based activities that engage students in active learning. Some hyperlinks would point to animations and simulations to provide dramatic visualization of concepts, chemical processes, and molecular-level phenomena. Other links would connect to concept and math supplements to provide greater depth, detailed derivations, and review relevant math concepts within a chemistry context. Such linking should make it easy for students to review material on a need to know basis as they advance through the text without having pages and sections that interrupt the narrative. A final set of links would point to Mathcad symbolic math templates that will be used in both a guided-discovery mode and as a resource for students in building their own Mathcad documents for assigned problems and activities. An instructor's manual and sets of numerical solutions to exercises and problems are also being created for the project.</AbstractNarration>
