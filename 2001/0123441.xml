    <AbstractNarration>We propose to develop technologies which will enable communication on a single&lt;br/&gt;optical fiber at rates in excess of 100 Tb/s within a few years. To accomplish this in the&lt;br/&gt;low-loss window of silica fibers (1200-1700 nm), there will be a need for novel very&lt;br/&gt;wideband devices, particularly optical amplifiers. In addition, modulation techniques with&lt;br/&gt;spectral efficiencies well in excess of unity will be needed. Our research activities will be&lt;br/&gt;centered in these two areas.&lt;br/&gt; We will investigate modulation techniques, and associated detection schemes,&lt;br/&gt;suitable to obtain a spectral efficiency of 4 b/s/Hz by the end of the project. The&lt;br/&gt;techniques will be designed to be resistant to impairments due to PMD and fiber&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearities. In particular, we will investigate novel techniques using appropriate&lt;br/&gt;combinations of PSK, QAM, and polarization-based techniques. Coherent detection will&lt;br/&gt;be utilized where indicated to boost spectral efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;We will investigate fiber optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) and discrete&lt;br/&gt;Raman amplifiers made from novel highly-nonlinear fibers. These fibers will have&lt;br/&gt;nonlinearity coefficients exceeding those of today's most nonlinear fibers by several&lt;br/&gt;orders of magnitude. These fibers will enable the development of novel nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;amplifiers , with gain bandwidth of a single device covering most of the 1200-1700 nm&lt;br/&gt;window. These devices will also use shorter fibers and lower pump powers than their&lt;br/&gt;current versions, and may thus lead to practical applications in a relatively short time.</AbstractNarration>
