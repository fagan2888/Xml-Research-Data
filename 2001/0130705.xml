    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0130705 -University of Washington-Guang R. Gao-Adaptive Neurally-Inspired Computing: Models, Algorithms, and Silicon-Based Architectures&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rapid advances in silicon technology over the past few decades have allowed digital&lt;br/&gt;devices to achieve ultra-high speeds in numerical computation. However, a majority of&lt;br/&gt;these devices are prone to catastrophic failure when confronted with circumstances&lt;br/&gt;unforeseen at programming time. Endowing such devices with the ability to adapt and&lt;br/&gt;learn from experience is rapidly becoming a problem of fundamental importance in&lt;br/&gt;information technology. We propose a new approach to solving this problem: building&lt;br/&gt;information technology systems based on neurobiological computation and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We intend to achieve this goal by developing computational models of plasticity and information processing in neurons and networks of neurons in selected sensory and motor areas of the brain; testing these models and their corresponding algorithms in software-based simulations, and designing real-time implementations of these algorithms in silicon using synapse transistors and field-programmable learning arrays (FPLAs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We expect our research to provide a better understanding of computation within neuronal&lt;br/&gt;networks, and to lead to a new generation of adaptive neuromorphic devices that could be&lt;br/&gt;used for a variety of information technology applications, ranging from signal processing&lt;br/&gt;and pattern recognition to ubiquitous computing and robotic control.</AbstractNarration>
