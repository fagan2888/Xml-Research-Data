    <AbstractNarration>0138697&lt;br/&gt;Dorfman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be devoted to further studies on the foundation&lt;br/&gt;of the theory of irreversible processes in fluid systems. Such processes&lt;br/&gt;include viscous and thermal flows as well as diffusive motion, chemical&lt;br/&gt;reactions, in both classical and quantum systems. Recent work by the PI&lt;br/&gt;and co-workers has shown that for most systems of interest, there is an&lt;br/&gt;underlying chaotic dynamics which can be viewed as the source of the&lt;br/&gt;irreversibility. The sensitivity of the motion of a chaotic system of&lt;br/&gt;particles to the precise values of the initial conditions of the particles&lt;br/&gt;reflects itself as an apparent randomness in the dynamics of the system.&lt;br/&gt;Current research is devoted to a study of entropy production and related&lt;br/&gt;irreversible phenomena in classically chaotic systems, as well as to the&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical versions of the systems and their processes. This&lt;br/&gt;latter direction is stimulated in part by recent work by many authors on&lt;br/&gt;the quantum behavior of classically chaotic systems which can be&lt;br/&gt;fruitfully applied to a study of irreversibility in quantum systems.&lt;br/&gt; Finally, work will be carried out to determine the analogous&lt;br/&gt;properties of non-chaotic systems, or of mixed chaotic and non-chaotic&lt;br/&gt;systems, with transport to study the modifications of the theory needed to&lt;br/&gt;treat such systems, as well.</AbstractNarration>
