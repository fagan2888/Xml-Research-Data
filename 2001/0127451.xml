    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;Instructional materials that fit undergraduate classroom teaching and laboratory experiments for the subject of web-based Instrumentation and Control (WIC) are scarce. The literature has a few examples of previous efforts to build virtual web-based laboratories, but most of these are very specialized and the support software is very expensive. It is the goal of this proof-of-concept project to offer an undergraduate course with a companion laboratory that teaches students to design and develop web tools for WIC. The idea is a result ot the research the PI conducted for Siemens and Motorola.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to demonstrate that (a) it is practical and feasible to offer engineering undergraduate students a course on WIC that involves recent technological innovations; (b) the proposed course can be effectively conducted with two integrated components--classrom lectures and hands-on practices through a remote setting; and (c) the course materials can also be offered after modification to gifted high school students and thus be used as a vehicle to attract students to the engineering disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan is to reinforce the process by regularly evaluating the project progress based on gathered data and information, and disseminating the project findings through conference presentations, scholarly publications, preparation of a textbook based on the lecture notes and laboratory materials.</AbstractNarration>
