    <AbstractNarration>This Chemistry Division award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Michigan State University, where a previous REU site was funded for 1998-2000. Louis Pignolet is the site's Program Director. Fourteen faculty are available to serve as REU student mentors. Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. The research areas in this program are environmental, materials, and biological chemistry. Activities will include weekly lunch seminars and regular research group meetings. All students will present a report on their research in the form of a poster or oral presentation at the end of the program. The program is evaluated by exit surveys of all participants, tracking the career choices of the participants, and surveying the faculty research mentors.</AbstractNarration>
