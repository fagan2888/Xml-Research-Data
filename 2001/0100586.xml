    <AbstractNarration>The proposal concerns the investigation of motivic cohomology of&lt;br/&gt;schemes and its relationships to algebraic K-theory. One part of the&lt;br/&gt;project proposes an investigation of generically contractible sheaves.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator intends to use the properties of such sheaves in&lt;br/&gt;an attempt to show that Grayson motivic cohomology coincides with &lt;br/&gt;Voevodsky one and hence Graysons construction gives another&lt;br/&gt;approach to the dvelopment of the motivic spectral sequence.&lt;br/&gt;Another part of the project concerns the Friedlander-Milnor Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator expects to develop new methods for the proof&lt;br/&gt;of the rigidity property for homology of the finite general&lt;br/&gt;linear group. Finally the investigator plans to figure out&lt;br/&gt;what if anything is missing in the proof of the Bloch-Kato Conjecture&lt;br/&gt;modulo an arbitrary prime integer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposal is in the area of mathematics known as&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry. The objective of algebraic geometry is to&lt;br/&gt;gain a deep understanding of the geometric properties of &lt;br/&gt;solutions to polynomial equations -- while everyone sees &lt;br/&gt;quadratic equations in school, equations of higher degree or&lt;br/&gt;more variables become much more subtle. Yet, because&lt;br/&gt;computer and robot computations are inherently finite&lt;br/&gt;approximations to the continuous "real world," understanding&lt;br/&gt;polynomials is vital to such endeavors.</AbstractNarration>
