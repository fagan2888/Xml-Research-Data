    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry students at the University of San Francisco (USF) complete many traditional wet chemistry techniques in their introductory lab courses. With this project, we are making use of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) and web-based writing-to-learn technology (Calibrated Peer Review, CPR) to explore environmental chemistry problems in general and analytical chemistry courses. We are adapting a number of environmentally significant chemistry experiments from the chemical education literature to improve conceptual understanding of technical subjects, to develop skills in reading for content and in scientific writing, and to link the writing assignment to hands-on experiments using atomic absorption spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;On-line source material on environmental problems and published experiments using AAS are being adapted for pre-lab and post-lab writing assignments using the web-based Calibrated Peer Review (CPR) program developed by the NSF-funded Molecular Science Project. First and second year science students in general and analytical chemistry, plus a group of non-science majors in a general education course are impacted by the project. Assignments are designed to explore how quantitative analysis by AAS can help identify environmental problems. The immediate impact includes (i) a deeper understanding of an environmental problem via the CPR pedagogy of reading for content and peer-review of writing assignments, (ii) exposure of introductory students to high quality analytical instrumentation, and (iii) more confidence and interest in quantitative chemistry. We are assessing student confidence and learning by conducting surveys tracking their exam performance, their writing assignments and by arranging informal discussions with students.</AbstractNarration>
