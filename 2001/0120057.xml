    <AbstractNarration>0120057 &lt;br/&gt;Crawford&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Korea seminar on information technology for product development to be held in Bokwang, Korea in July 2001. The co-organizers are Professor Richard Crawford of the University of Texas at Austin and Professor Yong Se Kim of Sungkyunkwan University in Korea. Information technology has revolutionized the entire product development design cycle, and will continue to do so. The seminar will enable U.S. and Korean researchers and graduate students to exchange the latest research findings in the areas of Internet-aided distributed design, virtual systems and environment, enterprise integration and product data management, solid freeform fabrication, and computer-aided process planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the seminar and associated activities are to 1) exchange information on recent advances; 2) visit Korean laboratories to gain an understanding of available expertise and facilities; 3) identify research areas that are particularly suited for U.S.-Korea collaboration; and 4) introduce American graduate students to research opportunities in Korea. The exchange of ideas and data with Korean experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will set the stage for future collaborative projects. Seminar organizers have made a special effort to involve students. Findings of the meeting will be publicized via professional journals and conferences.</AbstractNarration>
