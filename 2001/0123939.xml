    <AbstractNarration>The convergence of telecommunications networks rely heavily on the interconnection of networks and related Quality of Service (QoS). The Internet is evolving into a multi-class service, integrated network, which is trying to support various applications, which require QoS in addition to the traditional best-effort applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the proposal is to design, evaluate, develop and test new dynamic Quality of Service and bandwidth management mechanisms and systems that allow secure and scalable dynamic open provisioning for the interconnection of Differentiated services. The proposal will develop a Bandwidth Management Point to manage scalable and secure control, and performs the functions of service assignment, admission control, traffic conditioning and class routing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bandwidth Management Point will support intra-domain communications, which is useful for applications within the same domain. It will also support inter-domain applications including policy information such as reservation process, edge-to-edge admission control and peer-to-peer access control. The deliverables include the design, analysis and implementation of software.</AbstractNarration>
