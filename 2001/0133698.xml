    <AbstractNarration>The experience of providing or receiving medical care has a very&lt;br/&gt;personal dimension. Quoted from the Hippocratic oath:&lt;br/&gt;"Whatsoever I shall see or hear in the course of my dealings with&lt;br/&gt;men, if it be what should not be published abroad, I will never&lt;br/&gt;divulge, holding such things to be holy secrets". The 1996&lt;br/&gt;Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)&lt;br/&gt;required the Administration to issue regulations protecting the&lt;br/&gt;privacy of health information. Such a regulation gives consumers&lt;br/&gt;the right to see, copy, and correct their own health information&lt;br/&gt;and the right of being notified as to how their health&lt;br/&gt;information is going to be used and shared. It also imposes new&lt;br/&gt;restrictions on those who hold health information.&lt;br/&gt;However, legal protection alone is not enough as it can only be&lt;br/&gt;applied after the problem has occurred, when the damage has&lt;br/&gt;already been done. Moreover, law enforcement is usually&lt;br/&gt;expensive, slow, and complex. The goal of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;design a comprehensive technical infrastructure that guarantees&lt;br/&gt;the enforcement of health information privacy protection. The&lt;br/&gt;problem of data protection and privacy is addressed on a&lt;br/&gt;technical level, thus preventing any violation of a privacy&lt;br/&gt;policy in advance rather than correcting it after it has&lt;br/&gt;occurred. The intend of the project is to demonstrate that&lt;br/&gt;health information privacy solutions can be designed to achieve&lt;br/&gt;meaningful benefits without penalizing society with undue&lt;br/&gt;financial burdens or worse, with the compromise of public safety.</AbstractNarration>
