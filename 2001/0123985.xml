    <AbstractNarration>Distributed systems are becoming ever more important as they provide information support for basic infrastructures such as electrical and telephone service, and as a means for corporations to manage worldwide operettas. They are also becoming ubiquitous because many applications demand greater computational power and require distributed resources. The net impact is that a vast amount of data needs to be shared across a broad array of users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal plans to investigate the long-term issues of mobility and efficiency in the design of scalable middleware for distributed systems. The effort will include the implementation of a distributed middleware for mobile environments. Specific research themes to be pursued are:&lt;br/&gt;- formalization and implementation of consistency requirements for middleware&lt;br/&gt;- algorithms for data placement and replication&lt;br/&gt;- protocols for support of conflict resolution and the support of mobility, and&lt;br/&gt;- incorporation of stream data in a computational framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of these investigations will be the development of an experimental prototype that uses the researched algorithms and protocols. In order to experiment with the prototype, a number of applications will be implemented in a campus environment. The goal of the research is to help guide long-term development of middleware at large scale.</AbstractNarration>
