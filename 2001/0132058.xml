    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will develop software and hardware products that assist people with low vision to efficiently read and process information from many sources. These products will combine optical character recognition (OCR), speech synthesis and recognition technologies, together with customizable displays based on the latest vision research to accommodate a variety of visual impairments. These products will incorporate a 'Pick and Click' user interface, developed in Phase I, which does not require viewing the screen, yet presents visual displays useful to a low vision person, and is intuitive to fully sighted teachers experienced with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Included in the products will be functions particular to the low vision market, such as reading text optimally, enlarging pictures, and using a video camera for magnification while handwriting and viewing 3D objects. In addition, 'Pick and Click' interfaces to the most common computer applications programs, such as word processing, e-mail, Internet browser, spreadsheet, and financial accounting will be included.&lt;br/&gt; Low vision users will benefit from a low cost interface that provides a clean and less cluttered presentation of information on the screen. JBliss Imaging's proffered new technology has potential to improve access to and capability of manipulating information for the low vision population.. The technology also has potential to serve individuals with other disabilities, such as dyslexia and other forms of challenges to learning and reading abilities. Commercial applications are in schools, libraries, businesses, and homes.</AbstractNarration>
