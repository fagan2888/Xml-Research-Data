    <AbstractNarration>The research of the PI (Miller) focuses on the analytic theory of&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms. The proposed research concentrates on two analytic&lt;br/&gt;tools in the subject. The first is the trace formula. The PI hopes to&lt;br/&gt;sharpen Arthur's trace formula for GL(n) so that it can be applied to&lt;br/&gt;analytic questions in the same fashion that Selberg's original trace&lt;br/&gt;formula for GL(2) has been. One of the expected applications is to&lt;br/&gt;counting various types of automorphic forms, for example a general Weyl&lt;br/&gt;law for arithmetic quotients of reductive Lie groups. The second tool is&lt;br/&gt;that of automorphic L-functions. The PI and his coworker Wilfried Schmid&lt;br/&gt;(Harvard University) are engaged in a research program to study&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms using the boundary distributions of eigenfunctions on&lt;br/&gt;symmetric spaces. These boundary techniques allow new constructions of&lt;br/&gt;L-functions, and offer a new way to investigate many problems in&lt;br/&gt;automorphic forms. The proposed research involves developing this&lt;br/&gt;technique and its applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of automorphic forms slices across many important areas of&lt;br/&gt;modern mathematical research, including number theory, representation&lt;br/&gt;theory, geometry, analysis, and mathematical physics. Through&lt;br/&gt;L-functions, Langlands has conjectured many deep and interesting&lt;br/&gt;structural relationships between automorphic forms which have implications&lt;br/&gt;in the above areas. As an example, the work of Wiles et al demonstrates&lt;br/&gt;the link between certain automorphic forms and the ancient problem of&lt;br/&gt;solving equations between squares and cubes. The proposed research aims&lt;br/&gt;to apply and develop new tools for automorphic forms and L-functions from&lt;br/&gt;analysis, which is the branch of mathematics expanding calculus, and&lt;br/&gt;representation theory, the concrete study of symmetry. Current&lt;br/&gt;applications of automorphic forms and L-functions are manifest in&lt;br/&gt;constructing the sophisticated codes which enable high-speed and secure&lt;br/&gt;transactions over the internet.</AbstractNarration>
