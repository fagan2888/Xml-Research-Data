    <AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL NO.: 0103096&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Lu, Yicheng&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME: Rutgers University New Brunswick&lt;br/&gt;TITLE: NER: Feasibility Studies on ZnO Nanostructures And Their Device Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the exploratory research on zinc oxide (ZnO) based nanoscale structures&lt;br/&gt;and feasibility study of their device applications. ZnO is a multifunctional material possessing unique&lt;br/&gt;electrical, optical, acoustical, and mechanical properties. Semiconductor ZnO has a wide and direct&lt;br/&gt;energy bandgap (~3.3eV). ZnO can be grown at low temperatures, in contrast with the other wide&lt;br/&gt;bandgap materials, such as GaN and SiC. Its ternary compounds, formed by alloying ZnO with CdO and&lt;br/&gt;MgO, permit bandgap tuning from ~2.8 eV to ~4 eV. Doped ZnO ternaries can be made magnetic or&lt;br/&gt;ferroelectric, extending its applications beyond the traditional semiconductor confines. In this exploratory&lt;br/&gt;research, we will study growth mechanisms and conduct substrate engineering for selective growth of&lt;br/&gt;ZnO nanotips and nanotip arrays on various substrates, including R-plane sapphire, Si, silicon-on-sapphire&lt;br/&gt;(SOS), and GaN-on-sapphire. Feasibility studies of ZnO nanotip applications will focus on field-emission,&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional photonic bandgap (PBG), and fine instrumentation such as atomic force&lt;br/&gt;microscopy and scanning tunneling optical microscopy. We will also explore the feasibility to form CdO&lt;br/&gt;quantum dots in ZnO using the activated alloy phase segregation mechanism, which may be proved as a&lt;br/&gt;viable alternative to the Stranski-Krastanov mechanism. These quantum dots have potential applications&lt;br/&gt;in UV lasers and integrated UV optoelectronic chips. The proposed work will extend the research on&lt;br/&gt;nanoscale structures and devices into the field of wide bandgap semiconductor nanoscale science and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. The research and development of nanoscale structures in ZnO and its ternaries will lead to a&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally new class of devices, which integrate multi-phenomena and posses unprecedented multi-functional&lt;br/&gt;characteristics.</AbstractNarration>
