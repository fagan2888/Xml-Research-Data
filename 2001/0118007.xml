    <AbstractNarration>This award establishes a Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology at Rice University. The Center will foster the development of nanotechnology through an integrated set of programs that aim to address the scientific, technological, environmental, human resource, commercialization issues. The Center's research program is organized under three themes: (1) wet nanoscience integrating biology and nanochemistry; (2) nanomaterials in bioengineering; and (3) environmental applications, origin and impacts of nanostructured materials. Fundamental questions concerning how in organic materials interact with biochemical and cellular processes will be investigated. The research will also address the applications of nanomaterials to biomedical and environmental problems. The Center will work in collaboration with industry and government laboratories in developing bench-top and pilot scale proof-of-concept testbeds. A multi-user nanoparticle fabrication facility will be established with state-of-the art instrumentation. The research outreach will include the University of Texas Health Science Center and Geoscience and Environmental Laboratory of CNRS, France. The Center will foster nanoscience and engineering education by implementing course modules for upper level undergraduates, publication of a new textbook, and creating of an interactive web page. The education outreach activities will include training of middle and high school teachers in nanoscience and engineering. The Center will offer lectures and tutoring, experience in research laboratories and a sabbatical semester to focus on integrating their experiences into their teaching. The industrial affiliate program will enable member companies to send their senior scientists to the Center for research residency and tutorial courses. The Center will offer a year-long team taught graduate course on entrepreneurship in nanotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
