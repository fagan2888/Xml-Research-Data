    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0124016&lt;br/&gt;Ralph D. Kopperman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for participants at the&lt;br/&gt;Sixteenth Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications, &lt;br/&gt;to take place July 18-21, 2001 at City College in New York, NY.&lt;br/&gt;This Conference series addresses the need of topologists to &lt;br/&gt;share new ideas at a time of year when most are free of academic commitments, a need demonstrated by its continued growth. &lt;br/&gt;This series began in 1984 at the City College of New York with 35 participants and 13 talks. Over the past decade, attendance has averaged about 150, with participants all inhabited continents &lt;br/&gt;and about 100 talks. Today, after much concentration on &lt;br/&gt;problems internal to topology, emphasis in this field is again turning toward applications to other areas. Thus we have &lt;br/&gt;organized the following Special Sessions: Asymmetric Topology and Computer Science, Dynamical Systems, Topological Algebra and &lt;br/&gt;Functional Analysis, Set-theoretic Topology, and Topological &lt;br/&gt;Groups and Semigroups. Further information, including invited speakers, schedule of talks, and housing information, is available &lt;br/&gt;at sumtopo.att.net.</AbstractNarration>
