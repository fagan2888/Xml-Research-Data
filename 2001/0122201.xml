    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is to cover expenses associated with hosting the Digital Libraries Initiative All Projects Meeting in June 2001. The All Projects Meetings have been held semi-annually since the program's inception in 1994 and have been essential to building collaborations between funded projects, establishing and maintaining program identity and direction, and stimulating valuable personal interactions between researchers, graduate students, and information professionals from all sectors. The meeting agenda is structured to allow projects to report and demonstrate research products, and discuss and assess the relative merits and promise of new capabilities.</AbstractNarration>
