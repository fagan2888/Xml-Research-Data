    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: The Mechanics of Fracture in Superelastic Materials&lt;br/&gt; ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wendy C. Crone, Assistant Professor&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Mechanics Program, Department of Engineering Physics&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin - Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shape memory alloys (SMA) constitute a unique class of materials that have&lt;br/&gt;already proven to have wide-ranging applications in the biomedical,&lt;br/&gt;aerospace, microelectronics, and automotive industries. These materials&lt;br/&gt;have a crystallographic structure that can change reversibly and&lt;br/&gt;reproducibly, allowing the material to display dramatic stress-induced and&lt;br/&gt;temperature-induced recoverable deformations. One key hurdle to their use&lt;br/&gt;is the development of reliable SMA materials and structures, in which the&lt;br/&gt;material's microstructure is well understood and its resistance to fatigue&lt;br/&gt;and fracture can be reliably predicted. Critical topics to be investigated&lt;br/&gt;in this research involve: determining the effect of process-induced&lt;br/&gt;microstructure on fracture and fatigue behavior; exploring the effect of&lt;br/&gt;grain refinement on the fracture behavior for grain sizes ranging between&lt;br/&gt;the micron and nanometer scale; and developing experimentally-based models&lt;br/&gt;that delineate the mechanisms influencing fracture and fatigue in NiTi and&lt;br/&gt;Cu-based SMAs. In conjunction with this research, education initiatives&lt;br/&gt;will be undertaken to develop widespread training at the undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate levels in superelastic behavior and shape memory materials, via&lt;br/&gt;new course material in the areas of nanomaterials, micromechanics and&lt;br/&gt;fracture mechanics. Not only will the expanded course material provide&lt;br/&gt;students with an introduction to topics where mechanics has been developing&lt;br/&gt;influence and making critical contributions to new technologies, it will&lt;br/&gt;also have international impact via Smart Materials Exemplar of the&lt;br/&gt;Worldwide Universities Network, an international network of&lt;br/&gt;researchers/educators.</AbstractNarration>
