    <AbstractNarration>The Boise Extravaganza in Set Theory (BEST) is an annual&lt;br/&gt;conference in Set Theory hosted by Boise State University. It has&lt;br/&gt;run continuously since it began in 1992 and is the only regular&lt;br/&gt;conference in North America devoted primarily to Set Theory. The&lt;br/&gt;talks and the participants are representative of set theoretic&lt;br/&gt;research in North America with topics ranging from large&lt;br/&gt;cardinals, cardinal invariants of the continuum, core models,&lt;br/&gt;fine structure, descriptive set theory, set theoretic topology&lt;br/&gt;and analysis, forcing axioms, and combinatorics. The small scale&lt;br/&gt;of the conference --- about 20 participants, most presenting&lt;br/&gt;talks --- allows for an informal atmosphere and encourages&lt;br/&gt;discussion between the representatives of various areas of set&lt;br/&gt;theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general format is that of a three day conference. Four&lt;br/&gt;invited talks running approximately 50 minutes each are spread&lt;br/&gt;throughout the conference with the remainder of the schedule&lt;br/&gt;consisting of shorter contributed talks. NSF funds are used to&lt;br/&gt;cover the expenses of the invited speakers and to help defray the&lt;br/&gt;local and travel expenses of those who do not have their own form&lt;br/&gt;of travel support, especially graduate students. The organizers&lt;br/&gt;make a sincere effort to invite women, minorities, and young&lt;br/&gt;members of the field.</AbstractNarration>
