    <AbstractNarration>The research focuses on new approaches for exposing concurrency and improving performance in modern&lt;br/&gt;superscalar microprocessors. These approaches include semantic decomposition of instruction &lt;br/&gt;sets and bitslice decomposition of data paths to expose elements of the processor's control and data path &lt;br/&gt;to allow flexible, programmable control over at least a subset of the microarchitectural features &lt;br/&gt;that are available. Preliminary analysis shows that there are significant opportunities for reducing ALU &lt;br/&gt;cycle time, power consumption, and the deleterious effects of wire delay with little or no harmful &lt;br/&gt;effects on throughput measured in instructions per cycle. Further, the research proposes pre-execution &lt;br/&gt;using partial operand knowledge to resolve conditional branches, identify references that miss the cache, and mitigate the effects of other problematic instructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the proposed educational plan are to integrate advanced topics into the &lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin's computer architecture curriculum at the graduate and undergraduate level; &lt;br/&gt;to continue to involve undergraduate students in research to enhance their educational experience &lt;br/&gt;via exposure to leading-edge research topics; to incorporate advanced pedagogic techniques into the &lt;br/&gt;classroom environment in order to accommodate all learning styles; and to exploit emerging web-based &lt;br/&gt;technologies to streamline interactive and off-line communication between instructor and students.</AbstractNarration>
