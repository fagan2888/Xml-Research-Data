    <AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns several related problems in quantum information&lt;br/&gt;theory, all arising from the study of noisy quantum channels. The first&lt;br/&gt;problem is to prove additivity of minimal entropy and multiplicativity of&lt;br/&gt;the maximal trace norms for a unital qubit channel. This result would imply&lt;br/&gt;additivity of the Holevo capacity for such channels, thereby settling one&lt;br/&gt;particular case of a longstanding conjecture. The second problem is to&lt;br/&gt;investigate a conjectured equality between the Shannon capacity of a noisy&lt;br/&gt;quantum channel and a new quantity which was introduced in earlier work of&lt;br/&gt;the P.I.. The third problem involves a study of one special class of&lt;br/&gt;non-product measurements for product channels, with the goal of providing&lt;br/&gt;an interesting laboratory for testing ideas about entangled measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in nanotechnology have provided the opportunity for scientists to&lt;br/&gt;study and manipulate the quantum properties of microscopic systems,&lt;br/&gt;including single-atom systems and single-photon states. Recent theoretical&lt;br/&gt;discoveries indicate that such systems may have extraordinary properties. One example&lt;br/&gt;is the quantum computer, which is a theoretical device capable of&lt;br/&gt;outperforming any standard computer. Another example is a protocol for&lt;br/&gt;unconditionally secure encryption, which would be achieved by encoding&lt;br/&gt;messages as quantum states. Mathematics played a key role in the&lt;br/&gt;development of both of these ideas. The current proposal concerns a similar&lt;br/&gt;mathematical investigation of quantum devices which would be used to&lt;br/&gt;transmit and store information. A fundamental problem is to determine the&lt;br/&gt;information capacity of such a system, and thereby find the quantum analog&lt;br/&gt;of Shannon's famous expression for the capacity of a noisy channel. The&lt;br/&gt;P.I. describes a strategy for determining this capacity in an important&lt;br/&gt;special case, namely a memoryless channel where "qubits" are used to encode&lt;br/&gt;the information. The method of solution would involve some new mathematical&lt;br/&gt;ideas which may have applications to other areas of quantum information&lt;br/&gt;theory.</AbstractNarration>
