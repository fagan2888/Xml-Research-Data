    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Notre Dame is sponsoring a NSF-REU Site for undergraduate research during the summers of 2001 - 2003. The focal point of the proposed REU projects is the use of model systems and basic research to study the cellular and molecular basis of disease. A nationwide search will be conducted for 14 sophomore or junior participants. The primary goals of our program are to 1) expose students to the excitement of scientific discovery, 2) help students develop the skills needed to generate, analyze and report scientific data, 3) educate students on the professionalism needed to succeed in graduate school and beyond, 4) give students opportunities for leadership roles, and 5) encourage students to be responsible scientists and citizens by providing international research experiences and service opportunities. To reach these goals, participants will carry out research projects for 9 weeks. During these 9 weeks, they will speak on their proposed work twice, attend and coordinate a weekly seminar program to develop students professional and leadership skills, as well as to educate them on various career paths in biological sciences, attend weekly journal clubs where students will present current published research, and participate in an optional service component mentoring high school students. New to our proposed program is an international research component for two students each summer. The underlying aim of the program is to give students strong incentives for pursuing careers in research.</AbstractNarration>
