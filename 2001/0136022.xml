    <AbstractNarration>The PI plans to study finite dimensional normed spaces and convex bodies&lt;br/&gt;using methods of Fourier analysis. The idea is to express different&lt;br/&gt;properties of convex bodies in terms of the Fourier transform and then&lt;br/&gt;solve geometric problems using Fourier analytic methods.&lt;br/&gt;This approach has already led to several results including a&lt;br/&gt;complete analytic solution to the Busemann-Petty problem on sections&lt;br/&gt;of convex bodies. The PI plans to develop new connections between&lt;br/&gt;the Fourier transform, spherical harmonics and parallel section functions&lt;br/&gt;(X-rays) of convex bodies that will lead to new results on critical sections&lt;br/&gt;of convex bodies, intersection and projection bodies and to new results&lt;br/&gt;of Busemann-Petty type. A significant part of the work will be related to&lt;br/&gt;several open problems of the local theory of Banach spaces. This includes&lt;br/&gt;several possible Fourier analytic approaches to the slicing problem and&lt;br/&gt;the study of the central limit properties of convex bodies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important direction of the geometry of normed spaces is the study of&lt;br/&gt;geometric properties of convex bodies based on the properties of sections&lt;br/&gt;and projections of these bodies. This direction has already found&lt;br/&gt;numerous applications to engineering and medicine, starting with the&lt;br/&gt;classical theory of X-rays and geometric tomography. The goal of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop a new approach to the study of sections and&lt;br/&gt;projections of convex bodies based on methods of Fourier analysis.&lt;br/&gt;New connections between sections of convex bodies and the Fourier transform&lt;br/&gt;have been recently found by the PI and have already led to an analytic&lt;br/&gt;solution to the Busemann-Petty problem of whether smaller bodies can have&lt;br/&gt;uniformly larger central sections. The connections with Fourier analysis&lt;br/&gt;and geometric tomography will further relate methods and results of the&lt;br/&gt;Banach space theory to different areas of mathematics, engineering and&lt;br/&gt;medicine. New techniques for computing the Fourier transform will have&lt;br/&gt;independent value and can also be applied to signal processing and statistics.</AbstractNarration>
