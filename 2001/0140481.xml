    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0140481&lt;br/&gt;PI: Richard Laugesen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wavelet expansions are a mathematical tool that enable&lt;br/&gt;functions and data to be analyzed at multiple scales and&lt;br/&gt;locations simultaneously. The investigator seeks first to&lt;br/&gt;characterize all (non-tight) wavelet frames - these frames&lt;br/&gt;permit more flexibility than the widely-used orthonormal&lt;br/&gt;wavelets. Then he aims to characterize and find examples&lt;br/&gt;of wavelets whose dilation matrices expand in some directions&lt;br/&gt;but not in others. Another goal is to prove that the&lt;br/&gt;"Mexican hat" wavelet family is dense in all Lebesgue spaces,&lt;br/&gt;so that this family can be used to approximate data in more&lt;br/&gt;than just the mean-square sense. On a different topic, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator will also pursue questions about the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;model equations that underlie motion of thin fluid films. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research aims to mathematically determine the&lt;br/&gt;stability of steady states of these equations. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;"droplet" steady states will be studied. The existence of such&lt;br/&gt;stable steady states would signal the possibility of creating&lt;br/&gt;a pattern in the film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wavelet theory draws on fundamental mathematics and on&lt;br/&gt;engineering disciplines such as signal processing to create&lt;br/&gt;tools for efficiently analyzing and storing information.&lt;br/&gt;The two-way street between basic research and practical&lt;br/&gt;applications has been particularly effective in recent years.&lt;br/&gt;Abstract mathematical theories from harmonic analysis have&lt;br/&gt;been transformed into large scale engineering solutions (for&lt;br/&gt;example the FBI uses a wavelet compression technique to store&lt;br/&gt;its fingerprint images), while engineering challenges continue&lt;br/&gt;to stimulate fundamental research in mathematics. Many&lt;br/&gt;questions about the mathematical equations of fluid flow are&lt;br/&gt;famously difficult. In view of this difficulty, much research&lt;br/&gt;has concentrated on special situations, such as a thin film of&lt;br/&gt;fluid either sitting on or hanging from a flat surface. These&lt;br/&gt;films arise in many industrial coating situations, such as the&lt;br/&gt;manufacture of photographic film, or the coating of magnetic&lt;br/&gt;disk drives. The mathematical understanding of these problems&lt;br/&gt;became substantial only in the 1990s, and even now, much more&lt;br/&gt;is known in one space dimension than in the physically relevant&lt;br/&gt;case of two space dimensions, where this research will&lt;br/&gt;concentrate.</AbstractNarration>
