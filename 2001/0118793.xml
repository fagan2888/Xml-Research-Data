    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary: Conspicuousness and Concealment: The Visual Ecology of&lt;br/&gt;Signaling and Camouflage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All visual tasks that animals perform take place in natural scenes.&lt;br/&gt;Consequently, the visual systems of animals are adapted for efficient&lt;br/&gt;(often nearly optimal) analysis of the scenes they view in natural&lt;br/&gt;circumstances. Animals are rarely concerned with general scene&lt;br/&gt;properties, however. Rather, most objects of visual interest are other&lt;br/&gt;animals or plant food items such as fruits or flowers. Sometimes the&lt;br/&gt;visual object is decorated to become a strong signal. Other times, it&lt;br/&gt;may conceal itself using patterns that are confused with its natural&lt;br/&gt;background - it is camouflaged. Systems of signaling and camouflage&lt;br/&gt;must contend with both vision of other animals and properties of the&lt;br/&gt;background. Furthermore, neither the background nor the organism has a&lt;br/&gt;constant appearance because of continuous variations in the patterns of&lt;br/&gt;illumination falling upon them. These changing conditions strongly&lt;br/&gt;influence the visual appearances of scenes and signals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project considers the interrelationships among illuminants, scenes,&lt;br/&gt;signals, and animal vision. Research will concentrate on marine systems&lt;br/&gt;that offer excellent preliminary understanding of vision, color, and&lt;br/&gt;behavioral context: coral reef fishes, mantis shrimps, and cuttlefish.&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals are to learn how colors (i.e. spectral reflectances)&lt;br/&gt;and patterns of animals are adapted for enhanced conspicuousness or&lt;br/&gt;concealment, and how visual systems of animals are specialized to detect&lt;br/&gt;signals and to break camouflage. The power of this approach is that it&lt;br/&gt;compares a diverse selection of animals, all of which must form and&lt;br/&gt;recognize biological signals in shallow, clear marine waters. The&lt;br/&gt;research will be a pioneering effort to learn how systems of vision,&lt;br/&gt;signaling, and camouflage operate in extremely colorful (or well&lt;br/&gt;camouflaged) marine species in the specific contexts of their natural&lt;br/&gt;illuminants and backgrounds. The proposed research will contribute&lt;br/&gt;significantly to the fields of sensory biology, visual ecology, and&lt;br/&gt;animal behavior. It will similarly be of special interest to engineers&lt;br/&gt;and scientists working in remote sensing, machine vision, and artificial&lt;br/&gt;systems of object detection (including camouflaged objects). It will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the training of graduate students and enhance the research&lt;br/&gt;experiences of undergraduates working in the P.I.s laboratory, including&lt;br/&gt;women and minority students. (who are already involved with similar&lt;br/&gt;research in this laboratory). Last - and far from least - the project&lt;br/&gt;holds promise for stimulating scientific interest in the general public&lt;br/&gt;and all those interested in animal vision, color, and crypsis.</AbstractNarration>
