    <AbstractNarration>The University of Hawai'i at Hilo, on behalf of the state of Hawai'i, has requested NSF&lt;br/&gt;support for a planning grant designed to help Hawai'i set priorities for the improvement&lt;br/&gt;of the state's basic science and engineering research infrastructure. The project's&lt;br/&gt;objective is to design a statewide science and technology (S &amp;T) plan that will stimulate&lt;br/&gt;economic opportunities and wealth building capacity. The planning process will examine&lt;br/&gt;activities that have the potential to: (1) affect greater participation in academic research&lt;br/&gt;and development (R&amp;D) and (2) significantly improve the status of science and&lt;br/&gt;technology (S&amp;T) education and workforce development. The planning process will&lt;br/&gt;analyze the state's current S&amp;T infrastructure and inventory current research personnel&lt;br/&gt;and facilities. This analysis includes identifying: S&amp;T areas of current research&lt;br/&gt;excellence as well as areas with the potential for future national R&amp;D competitiveness.&lt;br/&gt;The planning process will result in a coordinated state-wide effort to improve academic&lt;br/&gt;R&amp;D capabilities in targeted disciplines, enhance training and education for students in&lt;br/&gt;science and engineering, and increase efforts to promote transfer of technology from the&lt;br/&gt;state's universities to Hawai'i's private and public sectors.</AbstractNarration>
