    <AbstractNarration>The Education Development Center is continuing the work of the K-12 Mathematics Curriculum Center. The Center continues to offer seminars designed to build capacity in the field. In particular, this work will assist mathematics coordinators, lead teachers and staff developers design professional development programs that support teachers using Standards-based materials; help districts consider the alignment between their new curriculum, classroom assessment and high-stakes tests; and help school districts develop plans for collecting and analyzing data and reporting results in order to evaluate the impact of their curriculum implementation. The Center will draw upon its experience with delivering seminars to districts in the past to develop on-line courses as a way of extending the services of the center to a wider audience. Another strong focus of the Center is to support the work of other mathematics implementation projects by developing materials and other products of use to these projects, by studying successful approaches and barriers to implementation and by facilitating communications among these projects</AbstractNarration>
