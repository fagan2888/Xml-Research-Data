    <AbstractNarration>We propose various directions for studying embedded minimal surfaces&lt;br/&gt;in three-manifolds. This includes the study of the convergence of such&lt;br/&gt;surfaces, how they degenerate and whether or not their Morse index is&lt;br/&gt;bounded. There are many possible applications of results along these lines&lt;br/&gt;including to the spherical space-form problem, the topology of&lt;br/&gt;three-manifolds with positive scalar curvature etc. In addition, these results should&lt;br/&gt;yield new insight into minimal surfaces in Euclidean space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on minimal surfaces in three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. Minimal surfaces are critical points for area (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;soap films are least area surfaces) and arise naturally in many&lt;br/&gt;problems in mathematics and in the other sciences. Many of the&lt;br/&gt;classical results in this area are on least area surfaces. In contrast,&lt;br/&gt;our main interest is in high index (i.e., highly unstable) embedded minimal&lt;br/&gt;surfaces with bounded topology - a well-known example is given by&lt;br/&gt;the standard helicoid. Roughly speaking, the point of some of our theorems&lt;br/&gt;is that the behavior of the helicoid is typical.</AbstractNarration>
