    <AbstractNarration>This project will conduct service measurements for a three year Shelf Basin Interaction Phase II field program in 2002-04. The service measurements include water temperature profiles, salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, transmissivity, fluorescence and photosynthetically active radiation; inorganic nutrients (nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, silicate and ammonia), chlorophyll-a, salinity and dissolved oxygen concentrations; and underway measurements including temperature and salinity, standard meteorological observations, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (velocity and backscatter), and various underway measurements made by SBI-designated science programs. A full set of service measurements will be made on two cruises each year in 2002 and 2004 and on one cruise in 2003. A limited set of measurements will be made on mooring emplacement cruises in FY 2002, 2003, and 2004. All service measurement data resulting from the work will be available at sea to all SBI investigators in scientifically useful form and&lt;br/&gt;will be placed on-line at a site linked to the UCAR Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS)&lt;br/&gt;and/or delivered to JOSS (or other designated official data repository for the SBI Phase II Field&lt;br/&gt;Program) via express service shortly after the conclusion of each cruise. Data will be reported in&lt;br/&gt;preliminary, interim, and final form as appropriate for the SBI Project.</AbstractNarration>
