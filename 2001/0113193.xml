    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: ITR Proposal 0113193&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Implementing Modular Program Analysis via Intersection&lt;br/&gt;and Union Types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Assaf J. Kfoury&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will investigate real-world relevance of a &lt;br/&gt;new framework for modular program-analysis, which uses "intersection" &lt;br/&gt;and "union" types. The starting point of this investigation is a &lt;br/&gt;recently designed polymorphic type system, called System I, for a &lt;br/&gt;foundational functional language, the lambda-calculus. The chief &lt;br/&gt;feature of System I is the use of "intersection" types together &lt;br/&gt;with the new technology of "expansion variables", which allow &lt;br/&gt;System I to satisfy a substitution-based principal-typings property. &lt;br/&gt;Although fully modular, the resulting program analysis is now &lt;br/&gt;restricted to a foundational language (the lambda-calculus) missing &lt;br/&gt;many standard high-level programming features such as conditionals,&lt;br/&gt;recursive definitions, exceptions, assignments, input/output, etc.&lt;br/&gt;Considerable work is necessary in order to turn System I into a &lt;br/&gt;type system for a full-fledged programming language such as Scheme &lt;br/&gt;(now considered to be the initial target language of proposed research).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is largely engineering work, aimed at producing &lt;br/&gt;an efficient prototype implementation, based on appropriate extensions &lt;br/&gt;of System I. The implementation will be evaluated --- or re-designed &lt;br/&gt;in parts --- by the extent to which it produces demonstrably better &lt;br/&gt;results in handling large software systems (enforcing larger classes &lt;br/&gt;of safety properties, statically detecting and ruling out larger classes &lt;br/&gt;of run-time errors).</AbstractNarration>
