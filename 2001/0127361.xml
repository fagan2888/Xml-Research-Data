    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;This project develops and creates a comprehensive computer lab manual, which is designed for use in an undergraduate abstract algebra class. The manual consists of a collection of group projects and student exercises that help illuminate and illustrate abstract algebra concepts. In addition, this manual includes exposition providing a context for the exercises and coherence. Many of the computer projects are designed to lead the student to specific conjectures about the structure of a group, ring, or field. The exercises and projects also provide the students and instructor with a rich source of examples. The computer is used to eliminate some of the need for computation by hand and allow the students to investigate larger and more elaborate examples. The manual engages students in an active learning environment by providing group projects and interaction with technology. An initial web site appeared in August of 2001. Current teaching resources, which integrate technology into upper division mathematics courses, are relatively limited. This manual provides such a resource for the area of abstract algebra.</AbstractNarration>
