    <AbstractNarration>The proposal is a collaborative proposal involving University of Pittsburgh &amp; Case Western Reserve University. The proposal plans to explore fundamental questions and associated middleware development issues to support broadcast and multicast data dissemination. When many people try to access the same information (for example, news sites during the Election), servers are often overwhelmed resulting in long delays. If an effective multicast capability existed across the Internet, a single server could have served all the requests, saving both computer power as well as reducing the amount of overall Internet traffic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The approach will highlight gaps in the state-of-the-art and will research and explore new techniques and algorithms. The objectives include&lt;br/&gt;1. transparently provide applications with data management services such as caching, scheduling and consistency maintenance, &lt;br/&gt;2. improve internet functionality, performance, and cost-effectiveness, and&lt;br/&gt;3. reduce the application development time while improving performance and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal plans to make the information and developed software available to</AbstractNarration>
