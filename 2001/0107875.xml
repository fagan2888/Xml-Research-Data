    <AbstractNarration>0107875&lt;br/&gt;Reynolds&lt;br/&gt;This award supports James Reynolds of Duke University and junior and senior researchers from various U.S. universities to participate in a workshop on assessment of the ecological, meteorological, and human dimensions of global desertification. Desertification is the result of a complex mixture of causes, including over-cultivation, overgrazing, fuel gathering, and climate variability. In areas affected, many perceive that the capacity of the land to support human populations, livestock, and wild herbivores has thereby been substantially reduced. Although much international effort has addressed this problem, many uncertainties and misconceptions still exist. A major challenge is to come up with a synthetic assessment framework for identifying what matters where and when in order to extrapolate results from studies in one area to other regions. To meet that challenge, the present workshop will focus directly on the synthetic framework and on forging working collaborations with international researchers from different disciplines. Especially important is that scientists recognize the need for new interdisciplinary approaches for addressing the pressing global problem of desertification and seek to explore a new paradigm for a synthetic framework that goes beyond regional concerns.</AbstractNarration>
