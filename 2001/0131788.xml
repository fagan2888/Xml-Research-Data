    <AbstractNarration>Marine cone snails of the genus Conus are predators that paralyze their prey by injecting potent neurotoxins. These toxins are peptides (11-45 amino acids long) that target ion channels crucial for normal electrochemical activity in nerve and muscle cells. A novel toxin has been discovered in one species, Conus californicus, which is a non-selective predator on worms, snails and fish. This toxins blocks nerve transmission by targeting voltage-gated sodium channels. This project uses biochemical, biophysical, and molecular approaches to elucidate the chemical structure of this peptide toxin, its mechanism of action, and its specificity profile, and to localize and clarify the basic biology of the venom production in this animal. &lt;br/&gt; Results will be important in developing a new experimental reagent for basic research on channels, and in understanding how different toxic peptides are made and used by these snails in a biologically relevant context. This lab also will continue important multi-disciplinary training of undergraduates in neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>
