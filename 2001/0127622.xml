    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) This project is incorporating digital imaging and image analysis technology across the biology curriculum so as to more fully implement investigative pedagogical approaches. The project adapts several key features of curriculum-wide imaging projects successfully implemented at other universities, most notably Franklin and Marshall College, Kutztown University, and Kent State University. However, the scope of the project is larger than those at other institutions in that digital imaging is being used extensively in the largest General Education lab science class, Introductory Biology. This course serves non-science majors, science majors, and pre-service K-12 teachers. The project is organized to provide Biology majors proficiency with this technology by introducing them to it in their first year and incrementally increasing their use of digital imaging and analysis in their upper division core and elective courses and undergraduate research. To accomplish these goals, the project is using a two-tiered approach. In the first tier students use workstations consisting of basic digital cameras, student compound and stereo microscopes, and computers to answer guided-inquiry questions in both Introductory Biology and upper division labs. At the second tier, two low-light level CCD cameras attached to high-quality microscopes are being used by all Biology majors in a centralized microscope facility to perform more sophisticated digital imaging and quantitative image analysis in classes and research projects. Faculty development is being accomplished through instructor training on equipment acquired.</AbstractNarration>
