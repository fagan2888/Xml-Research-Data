    <AbstractNarration>M. Frederick Hawthorne, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Los Angeles, is continuing his research into functionalized carboranes with the support of the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program. Methylation of carboranes leads to octamethyl derivatives. These methyl groups will be functionalized to give "camoflagued carboranes" with desirable properties. The methylated carboranes will be studied as ligands for electron-deficient transition metals analogous to pentamethylcyclopentadienyl. Direct hydroxylation of boranes provides route into other new classes of boron clusters with tunable electronic properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carboranes and boranes have interesting structures and have led to new insights into bonding. The functionalized clusters studied in this grant may have applications in water-soluble catalysis, drug delivery, and molecular electronics. The project incorporates synthesis, characterization and materials applications, making it an excellent project for training students.</AbstractNarration>
