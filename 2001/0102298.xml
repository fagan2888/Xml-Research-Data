    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0102298&lt;br/&gt;Helmut H. Hofer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main tool for most of the proposed projects is a &lt;br/&gt;particularly adapted theory of holomorphic curves, &lt;br/&gt;which has been developed by Dr. Hofer and his co-workers &lt;br/&gt;in recent years. The fact, that there is such a close, &lt;br/&gt;but completely unexpected, relationship between some &lt;br/&gt;important class of dynamical systems and a suitable &lt;br/&gt;theory of holomorphic curves has deep implications. &lt;br/&gt;Immediately it makes it, in principle, feasible to &lt;br/&gt;relate questions about large classes of dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems to recent mathematical theories like quantum &lt;br/&gt;cohomology, Gromov-Witten invariants, and in low &lt;br/&gt;dimensions even to Seiberg-Witten invariants. One of the &lt;br/&gt;main goals of this project will be the development of a &lt;br/&gt;mathematical machinery for constructing global surfaces &lt;br/&gt;of section for three-dimensional Reeb flows and &lt;br/&gt;generalizations thereof. In practice this means that &lt;br/&gt;the study of certain three-dimensional dynamical system &lt;br/&gt;can effectively be reduced to two dimensions. The other &lt;br/&gt;goal is the development of a symplectic field theory. &lt;br/&gt;Particular cases of such a theory are Gromov-Witten &lt;br/&gt;invariants and Floer Homology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many physical systems like the flow of an incompressible&lt;br/&gt;ideal fluid, the movement of a satellite under the &lt;br/&gt;gravitational forces of celestial bodies, or the &lt;br/&gt;movement of charged particles in a magnetic field, &lt;br/&gt;to name a few, are examples of so called dynamical systems. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical theory of dynamical systems provides &lt;br/&gt;tools to understand their complex behavior and allows&lt;br/&gt;to make predictions. The particular examples mentioned &lt;br/&gt;above are of so-called Hamiltonian nature. For such systems, &lt;br/&gt;beginning with the work of Lagrange and Hamilton, &lt;br/&gt;geometric tools have been developed leading to the &lt;br/&gt;modern theory of contact and symplectic geometry. These &lt;br/&gt;geometries play a central role in connecting mathematical &lt;br/&gt;areas like dynamical systems, algebraic geometry and &lt;br/&gt;smooth topology. This makes it possible to employ powerful &lt;br/&gt;tools from different mathematical areas in the study of &lt;br/&gt;important classes of dynamical systems and also to use &lt;br/&gt;ideas from dynamical systems to study important intrinsic &lt;br/&gt;questions in other fields by new methods.</AbstractNarration>
