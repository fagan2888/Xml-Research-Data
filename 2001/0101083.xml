    <AbstractNarration>Survey research has consistently demonstrated variation in the intimate lives and dyadic arrangements of heterosexual and homosexual men, including rates of partner change, expectations of emotional commitment, and acceptance of non-monogamous practices. However, the pathways to these differences are less well understood. Theories and studies often treat preferences of gay and straight men as fixed "traits" of individuals, when orientations develop and change over the life course. Taking a social constructionist life course perspective, this project examines how structural contexts of opportunity and relational histories affect the development of intimate orientations and careers, and how orientations are constructed in response to these opportunities and constraints. The project gathers life histories of 100 heterosexual and homosexual (black and white) males between 21 and 49 years of age in New York City. The life history method tracks continuities and turning points in intimate practices and dyadic arrangements from baseline orientations to the present. It also explores racial differences in these processes. Rather than make generalizations about gay and straight men, the project captures the dynamic interplay of structure and process, and thereby contributes to a more sociological understanding of behavior that is often viewed from individualistic or biological perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
