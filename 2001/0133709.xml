    <AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator is requesting funds requested to continue Office of Polar Programs (OPP) support for graduate student participation in the annual Arctic Workshops. Over the last eight years, OPP has supported attendance at this workshop through payments of registration, per diem meals, and lodging for four nights. The last grant supported the Arctic Workshop at the Universities of Ottawa, Colorado, Washington, and Massachusetts. The budget is based on an attendance of 25 students, but the actual number per workshop was closer to 50. The next three workshops will be held at the University of Colorado, the University of Tromso (Norway), and the University of Colorado. The composition of the Arctic Workshops typically consists of about 55% professional Arctic scientists (academic and government), and 45% graduate students. A major effort is placed toward providing all the graduates with a forum for their research and to establish the appropriate "network" with their peers. The Arctic Workshops have participants from several countries with significant attendance from the United States, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Germany/Austria, and the United Kingdom.</AbstractNarration>
