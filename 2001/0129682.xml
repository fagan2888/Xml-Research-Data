    <AbstractNarration>Pervasive Information Communities Organization (PICO) is a framework to&lt;br/&gt;create mission-oriented dynamic communities of software agents that perform tasks&lt;br/&gt;on behalf of users and devices. PICO provides automated continual services to&lt;br/&gt;improve quality of life, and to utilize resources efficiently by enhancing&lt;br/&gt;existing Internet services. PICO enabled Internet will be used effectively&lt;br/&gt;in many dynamically changing time-critical applications that demand&lt;br/&gt;proactive real-time collaborations among physical devices, software agents,&lt;br/&gt;and personnel in heterogeneous environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main components of PICO are software entities, called delegents&lt;br/&gt;(intelligent delegates) and hardware entities, called camileuns (connected,&lt;br/&gt;adaptive, mobile, intelligent, learned, efficient, ubiquitous nodes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel features of PICO include: i) creation of mission-oriented dynamic&lt;br/&gt;communities of software agents, ii) QoS management for just-in-time&lt;br/&gt;communication and proactive collaboration among communities, and iii)&lt;br/&gt;adaptability to dynamic environments through context- and&lt;br/&gt;location-awareness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a pervasive computing paradigm, PICO has applications in many domains&lt;br/&gt;such as telemedicine, the military, crisis management, and many day-to-day&lt;br/&gt;activities. In this project the researchers focus on the design and development of PICO,&lt;br/&gt;and investigate its applicability as a platform for distributed&lt;br/&gt;collaborations. Through telemedicine applications, the researchers demonstrate the full&lt;br/&gt;potential of PICO as an Internet enhancement framework that is not only&lt;br/&gt;unique, simple, and versatile, but can also work with current and future&lt;br/&gt;hardware/software tools. Specifically, the proposed tasks include: formal&lt;br/&gt;specifications, design, and development of PICO architecture; requirements&lt;br/&gt;analysis for telemedicine scenario; QoS and resource management; PICO&lt;br/&gt;prototype development; and validation, performance evaluation and&lt;br/&gt;benchmarking. PICO-enabled pervasive environments will revolutionize the way&lt;br/&gt;the Internet is being used, enhance quality of life and promote user-centric&lt;br/&gt;applications. The PICO project will result in the training of students in&lt;br/&gt;pervasive computing, high quality masters and doctoral theses, and transfer&lt;br/&gt;of technology to health care providers, professionals and other researchers.</AbstractNarration>
