    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Civil (54)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Retention of first year engineering students is approximately 75% in the US. One reason for the low retention rate may be the ineffectiveness of the introductory engineering course. A poorly designed introductory course does not engage the students and does not motivate them to persevere through their heavy load of mathematics and science courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating an introductory civil and environmental engineering course that adapts the "Sooner City" program. "Sooner City" is a virtual city that allows students to design a variety of infrastructure needs such as roadways, building structures, foundations, earthen dams, etc. "Sooner City" program had been developed to be used in a design across the curriculum environment, and thus adaptation of the concept to a single introductory course appears to be promising for retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of:&lt;br/&gt;1. Creating a portable first year "Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering, (ICEE)" course based on the Sooner City program.&lt;br/&gt;2. Assessing the success of the ICEE course at meeting the following global objectives:&lt;br/&gt; a. Stimulating interest in engineering among freshmen;&lt;br/&gt; b. Providing freshmen with an understanding of the breadth of the civil and environmental engineering profession;&lt;br/&gt; c. Positively impacting retention of freshman civil and environmental engineering students.&lt;br/&gt; d. Widespread adoption at other universities as a result of its portability, modularity, and cost-effectiveness.&lt;br/&gt;3. Providing course materials on a web site to facilitate implementation of the course at other universities.&lt;br/&gt;4. Beta testing the ICEE course at other universities.</AbstractNarration>
