    <AbstractNarration>A workshop focused on international networking opportunities in materials research and education will be held in conjunction with the Seventh International Union of Materials Research Societies'lnternational Conference on Advanced Materials (RJURS-ICAM) in Cancun, Mexico, in August 2001. This conference provides a unique opportunity for materials scientists from around the world to present their latest discoveries and discuss their findings with colleagues. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference participants will be able to take advantage of the specialized topical symposia while simultaneously meeting with potential collaborators through the networking workshop. The workshop is part of a broader effort to establish a global materials research network. It consists of a'collaboration fairin which linkages to create three global networks in the areas of materials education, materials for energy and for the environment will be developed.</AbstractNarration>
