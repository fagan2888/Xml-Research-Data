    <AbstractNarration>The North Dakota "Advancing Science Excellence in North Dakota (ASEND)" initiative is aimed at expanding the research capacity of North Dakota and to strengthen its ability to participate in the nation's mainstream science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) enterprise. This initiative capitalizes on North Dakota's existing research strengths and takes advantage of opportunities to integrate research into education and into the economy of the state. The ASEND initiative will develop SEM infrastructure at North Dakota State University (NDSU) and the University of North Dakota (UND) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;North Dakota (ND) will focus on three research areas: catalysis, biocomplexity and multisensory integration. Each of these areas has been identified as niche to the state and contributing to national interests. In the area of catalysis, an interdisciplinary network of researchers will build on ND's current expertise in polymers and combinatorial chemistry to develop novel processes and materials, particularly those with technology transfer/commercialization potential. The biocomplexity focus area will concentrate initially on the influence of parasitism on biocomplexity. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will investigate the role of parasites on host population genetics, landscape ecology, sexual selection, host bioenergetics, biodiversity and evolution. The multisensory integration research area will bring together cognitive and sensory psychologists with neurophysiologists to study sensation, perception, cognition and action. Researchers will investigate the sites, structures and processes of neural activity associated with multisensory integration. Potential applications include the development and evaluation of virtual environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research efforts, the ND project includes a multifaceted human resource development program designed to increase the opportunities available for students of the ND University System to participate in research and to increase the number of members of underrepresented groups (e.g., low income, first-generation college, women, Native Americans) involved in SEM research activity. Moreover, a technology transfer program designed to facilitate academic-private sector partnerships and integration of research into the economy of the state will be implemented. The technology transfer effort includes programs linking undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty with local industries and a commercial feasibility support program.</AbstractNarration>
