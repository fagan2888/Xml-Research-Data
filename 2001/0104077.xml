    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0104077&lt;br/&gt;Stephan Stolz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to study the question&lt;br/&gt;which manifolds admit Riemannian metrics of positive scalar&lt;br/&gt;and Ricci curvature, respectively. Concerning the&lt;br/&gt;first question, previous work of the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator shows that these questions boil down to&lt;br/&gt;computing abelian groups which depend only on the&lt;br/&gt;dimension, the fundamental group and the first two&lt;br/&gt;Stiefel-Whitney classes of the manifold these metrics&lt;br/&gt;live on. The role these groups play in the &lt;br/&gt;existence/classification problem for positive scalar&lt;br/&gt;curvature metrics is analogous of the role of Wall's&lt;br/&gt;surgery obstruction groups in the existence/classification&lt;br/&gt;problem for smooth structures. The principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;hopes to gain an algebraic/functorial understanding of &lt;br/&gt;these groups by studying various maps that relate these &lt;br/&gt;groups with homology/K-theory/connective K-theory of &lt;br/&gt;classifying spaces of groups, and with the K-theory of the&lt;br/&gt;associated group C*-algebras. Concerning positive Ricci &lt;br/&gt;curvature, the investigator is pursuing a proof of his &lt;br/&gt;conjecture that the existence of a positive Ricci &lt;br/&gt;curvature metric on a spin manifold with vanishing &lt;br/&gt;first Pontryagin class implies the vanishing of its&lt;br/&gt;Witten genus. This invariant arose from considerations &lt;br/&gt;in string theory. Heuristically it is the index of a yet &lt;br/&gt;to be rigorously defined "Dirac operator" on the free &lt;br/&gt;loop space of this manifold. Mike Hopkins has described a &lt;br/&gt;homotopy theoretic way to define the Witten genus of a &lt;br/&gt;family of such manifolds which lives in the elliptic &lt;br/&gt;cohomology of the parameter space. It is a very interesting &lt;br/&gt;challenge to express the elliptic cohomology and the&lt;br/&gt;family Witten genus in terms of the objects that string &lt;br/&gt;theorists are analysing and thus to give a geometric &lt;br/&gt;interpretation of Hopkins construction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects fit in the general framework of trying &lt;br/&gt;to relate the topology of a manifold (qualitative &lt;br/&gt;information about its global shape) and its geometry &lt;br/&gt;(quantitative information about its local shape). For&lt;br/&gt;2-dimensional manifolds (like the surface of a ball or &lt;br/&gt;a tire), a nice classification has been known for a long &lt;br/&gt;time: Two such surfaces have the same topology (that is, &lt;br/&gt;they can be deformed into each other if we think of&lt;br/&gt;them as being made of thin rubber) if and only if they &lt;br/&gt;have the same number of `holes' (the surface of a ball &lt;br/&gt;no holes, the surface of a tire or a cup has one hole, &lt;br/&gt;and a pretzel has two holes). Moreover, if a surface has&lt;br/&gt;`positive curvature' in the sense that the angle sum in &lt;br/&gt;each triangle whose edges are geodesics (shortest curves) &lt;br/&gt;is larger than 180 degrees, then this surface has the &lt;br/&gt;same topology as the surface of a ball. It is a major &lt;br/&gt;goal of modern day mathematics to generalize these &lt;br/&gt;results to higher dimensional manifolds. For example, &lt;br/&gt;our universe is a manifold of dimension 3, Einstein's &lt;br/&gt;space-time has dimension 4, and manifolds of dimension 10, respectively, 26 play a crucial role in the theoretical &lt;br/&gt;physics of the attempted unification of the four &lt;br/&gt;fundamental forces.</AbstractNarration>
