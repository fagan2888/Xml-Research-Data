    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0138352&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The atmospheric transport and air-sea exchange of aerosols and gases play major roles in the global geochemical cycles of many elements. These processes also exert significant controls on the global radiation budget and affect the concentrations and distributions of major anthropogenic pollutants. Much of our present knowledge of atmospheric transport and ocean- atmosphere exchange has come from time-series data collected at atmospheric sampling stations, of which oceanic sites are essential components. Bermuda has been a key sampling location for numerous studies of the marine atmosphere, owing to its strategic geographic location in the western North Atlantic, and it is likely to feature importantly in future field studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the research team at the Bermuda Biological Station for Research will: (1) upgrade and maintain a state-of-the-art atmospheric sampling station at Tudor Hill, Bermuda; (2) operate this atmospheric sampling station to provide facilities for the collection of atmospheric samples and operation of analytical instrumentation in research programs led by other investigators; and (3) collect and store selected core meteorological data and atmospheric samples on a continuous basis, in collaboration with and in support of other investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The time-series data and samples collected in this program will provide the basic context for future marine-atmospheric research programs to be conducted in the Bermuda region, while the upgrade and maintenance of sampling facilities will provide the basic support needed for such programs.</AbstractNarration>
