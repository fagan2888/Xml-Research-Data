    <AbstractNarration>This symposium, to be held at the Materials Research Society Meeting November 26-30, focuses on polymer interfaces and thin films.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Polymer interfaces are critical for many technological and industrial applications in thin films such as found in electronic packaging, lithographic applications, sensor technology, or in bulk systems such as adhesives or polymer blends. The structure and architecture of interfaces in thin films and bulk polymeric systems involving applications can be exceedingly complex. In thin films, the technological drive to diminish film thickness while simultaneously enhancing homogeneity, stability and adhesion is a challenging task driving research in newer areas of nanofilled and controlled nanostructured and nanopatterned films. Tailoring of surface and interfacial properties are equally important for new developments in traditional fields of bulk polymer blends, reactive and compatibilized systems, etc. Since empirical approaches to R&amp;D can be time-consuming and costly, the need also exists for concurrent development of theory and modeling, and simulations of polymer interfaces with predictive capability of ultimate structure-property relationship. Novel methodologies and measurement techniques also play an important role in the future development of the field, especially with the advent of combinatorial methods to thin film coatings for material science. A joint symposium with "Combinatorial Approach to Polymers" is planned.</AbstractNarration>
