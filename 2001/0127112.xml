    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Electrical (55)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is adapting and implementing a pair of laboratory courses to teach the microfabrication techniques required to create microdevices. Materials and instrumentation for microfabrication techniques are being procured and constructed in a laboratory, and process sequences are being adapted from similar programs and implemented in the laboratory. Using these facilities and techniques, students are making transistors and simple MEMS devices. Assessment involves student course evaluations and peer review where faculty, industrial and government representatives interested in microfabrication examine the course content, student work, and student course evaluations. Dissemination plans include reporting results in journal and conference publications and on a web site and developing an Internet-based course on microfarication.</AbstractNarration>
