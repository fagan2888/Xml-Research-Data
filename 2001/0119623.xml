    <AbstractNarration>Because of its high performance, low cost, and compatibility with silicon&lt;br/&gt;CMOS, SiGe HBT technology has recently emerged as a contender for both&lt;br/&gt;mobile and optical networking applications. Current SiGe HBTs designs are&lt;br/&gt;focused on improving the speed of these devices, while our recent&lt;br/&gt;experiments have shown that the optimum device structure for wireless&lt;br/&gt;applications are considerably different. Issues important for mobile and&lt;br/&gt;optical networking, such as 1/f noise, phase noise (frequency domain&lt;br/&gt;sideband and time domain jitter), and linearity, have not been researched&lt;br/&gt;as a function of the device structure, or optimized for&lt;br/&gt;these performance targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is aimed at systematically examining the impact of&lt;br/&gt;bandgap engineering and scaling on all of the device figures-of-merit that&lt;br/&gt;are of interest to both wireless and optical communication IC's, and use&lt;br/&gt;of these results to optimize the SiGe profiles and geometries for next&lt;br/&gt;generation SiGe HBTs. We expect the design tradeoffs to be much more&lt;br/&gt;complicated than in first generation SiGe HBTs, because of aggressive&lt;br/&gt;vertical and horizontal scaling to achieve high speed operation (as high&lt;br/&gt;as 200GHz cutoff frequency and maximum oscillation frequency). In the&lt;br/&gt;process, we will answer scientifically intriguing and technologically&lt;br/&gt;important questions, such as why SiGe HBTs with a nonlinear I-V can have&lt;br/&gt;excellent linearity. This is a brand new area of SiGe device research, and&lt;br/&gt;has a high potential payoff given the exploding industry interest in&lt;br/&gt;applying SiGe technology to wireless and optical networking systems. The&lt;br/&gt;outcome will include a scientific understanding of important open&lt;br/&gt;questions on SiGe HBTs, a modification of the design approach and&lt;br/&gt;methodology, as well as data of the key device figures-of-merit as a&lt;br/&gt;function of SiGe profile. Given the enormous amount of interest in&lt;br/&gt;applying SiGe technology to both wireless and optical networking&lt;br/&gt;applications, we will develop an advanced course on SiGe HBTs, so that the&lt;br/&gt;outcome of the proposed research can be remotely accessed by graduate&lt;br/&gt;students and practicing engineers in industry.</AbstractNarration>
