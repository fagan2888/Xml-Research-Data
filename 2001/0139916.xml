    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: 0139916&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michal Misiurewicz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigator will perform research in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems, mainly low-dimensional (both smooth and continuous)&lt;br/&gt;and symbolic. He will apply analytical, topological and combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;tools in order to investigate real and complex systems. A substantial&lt;br/&gt;part of the project is aimed at providing bridges between real and&lt;br/&gt;complex, one- and two-dimensional dynamics. A new class of&lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional systems will be considered. Quadratic laminations will&lt;br/&gt;be looked upon from the point of view of combinatorial dynamics and&lt;br/&gt;rotation theory. For other systems attractors, periodic orbits,&lt;br/&gt;rotation sets and topological entropy will be in the center of&lt;br/&gt;attention. Moreover, symbolic systems with an additional local order&lt;br/&gt;structure will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For almost every phenomenon from Physics, Chemistry, Biology,&lt;br/&gt;Medicine, Economy and other sciences one can make a mathematical model&lt;br/&gt;that can be regarded as a dynamical system. Sometimes the study of&lt;br/&gt;this system is extremely difficult, but quite often it can be reduced&lt;br/&gt;to the study of a much simpler, low dimensional or symbolic one. This&lt;br/&gt;project is devoted mainly to the investigation of the properties of&lt;br/&gt;these types of systems from the mathematical point of view. The&lt;br/&gt;results that can be obtained are usually much stronger than in the&lt;br/&gt;general case and often lead to much deeper understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;original systems.</AbstractNarration>
