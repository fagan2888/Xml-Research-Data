    <AbstractNarration>Grossmann&lt;br/&gt;0104315&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Argentina Program award will provide support for cooperative research between Dr. Ignacio Grossmann of Carnegie-Mellon University and Drs. Jaime Cerda and Aldo Vecchietti of Universidad Nacional del Litoral in Santa Fe, Argentina. Their work is in the integration of disjunctive programming and constrained logic programming for the design and scheduling of process systems.&lt;br/&gt;This project will introduce recent advances on generalized disjunctive programming and constrained logic programming to the combinatorial problems that come up in scheduling of process systems. The collaborators will concentrate on short term mixed batch/continuous multiproduct scheduling and design models. Dr. Grossmann has experience in the area of mixed integer linear and nonlinear optimization and its applications in a variety of areas including process operations problems, while Dr. Cerda has expertise in heat exchanger network synthesis as well as process scheduling problems. Results of this work will have applications in design, scheduling, and control, as well as in a variety of engineering and science areas.</AbstractNarration>
