    <AbstractNarration>CCR-0132673&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Assessment of Open-Source Software for High-Performance&lt;br/&gt; Computing &lt;br/&gt;Edward B. Allen, P.I.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement an integrated program of empirical&lt;br/&gt;software-engineering research and an exemplar of education in&lt;br/&gt;empirical methods for undergraduate and graduate students in&lt;br/&gt;software engineering. This will be achieved through research&lt;br/&gt;focused on assessing the quality of open-source software for&lt;br/&gt;high-performance computing, and through development of relevant&lt;br/&gt;courses and teaching modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;High-performance computing is the platform of choice in many fields&lt;br/&gt;of science and engineering that are critical to modern society.&lt;br/&gt;Off-the-shelf software packages in this category include tools to&lt;br/&gt;implement mathematical models, and middleware to manage parallel&lt;br/&gt;and distributed computation. The open-source approach of software&lt;br/&gt;development is becoming increasingly attractive in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research activities of this program will employ empirical analysis&lt;br/&gt;methods to find ways to assess the quality of open-source software&lt;br/&gt;for high-performance computing, enabling scientific and engineering&lt;br/&gt;users to make better informed choices. Case studies of selected&lt;br/&gt;software products will validate the practicality and usefulness of&lt;br/&gt;obtaining such quality assessments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Software-engineering education in America is largely lacking&lt;br/&gt;instruction in empirical analysis methods. A spectrum of teaching&lt;br/&gt;materials targeted toward this need will be developed. Research&lt;br/&gt;results and instructional materials will be disseminated through&lt;br/&gt;publications and the NSF-sponsored Center for Empirically Based&lt;br/&gt;Software Engineering (CeBASE).</AbstractNarration>
