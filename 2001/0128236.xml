    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to establish the technical and economic feasibility of a novel technology to completely oxidize formaldehyde at dilute concentrations in air at room temperature by use of a novel catalyst system. Formaldehyde-containing resins are widely used in the U.S., leading to widespread emissions of formaldehyde at the product formation molds, and in storage and use of these resins. A novel technology will be developed to completely destroy the formaldehyde using room temperature catalytic oxidation with a new class of noble metal reducible oxide (NMRO) catalysts designed specifically for such compounds. This new class of catalysts provides destruction efficiencies for the complete oxidation of formaldehyde dramatically higher than traditional platinum VOC oxidation catalysts. This research program will utilize catalyst composition studies to tailor a superior catalyst for this application, reactor studies of the destruction efficacy of the NMRO class of catalysts, and a competitive cost analysis of the technology relative to other alternatives for formaldehyde destruction. &lt;br/&gt; The commercial applications for the concept will be for efficient cleansing of indoor air, cleansing of workplace air, and control of emissions at ambient temperature and low cost, capable of rapid deployment. The commercial applications of the research should be of value to both the private sector and the government sector, providing cost effective commercial systems to enhance indoor air quality and emissions controls. The program should help protect the nation's environment and improve economic competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>
