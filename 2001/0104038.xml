    <AbstractNarration>This proposal is concerned with the analysis of large data with many dimensions. For a variety of reasons, it is often desirable to reduce the dimensionality first. Using the techniques of sliced inverse regression and principal Hessian directions as building blocks, new methods are developed for more complex applications involving many input and output variables simultaneously. When the variables consist of time series or curves, automatic basis searching systems are derived for modeling both the deterministic trends and the stochastic patterns. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientific data from a variety of disciplines have accumulated in unprecedented volume and complexity. This is exemplified by the massive gene expression profiles generated by microarray technologies. Hidden under many public accessible rich databases is a gold mine of biological messages, awaiting genomic researchers' exploration. Powerful statistical methods from clustering and classification have been successfully applied to dig them out. But the variety of information that can be distilled is so diverse that the pursuit of new paths is more than warranted. The new methods developed in this project will meet this demand. In particular, they can be used to visualize both the local and the global interaction in gene expression, to infer metabolic circuitry and enzyme functionality, to shed light on the multi-task coordination at different stages of the cell cycle, and to explore the relationship between drug responsiveness and gene profiles.</AbstractNarration>
