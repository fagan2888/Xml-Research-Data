    <AbstractNarration>The Information Technology Scholars (ITS) program is using a grant from the National Science Foundation's Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarship (CSEMS) program to establish ongoing support for academically promising students with financial need to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from St. Bonaventure University and to enter the workforce as information technology professionals. The CSEMS funds are used to support four students for four years and an additional four students for three years. The university will continue the program by funding the final year of the second cohort of students and by providing four-year awards to two students per year annually. &lt;br/&gt;The program is designed to attract students who have demonstrated a strong work ethic and commitment to computer science as high school students. The Department will use the one hundred and fifty high school teachers who have participated in departmental outreach programs to recommend students for the program. &lt;br/&gt;The Department has an exemplary record for preparing undergraduates for entry-level positions in information technology. Since 1989 100% of its graduates have entered the workforce as computer professionals or have gone on for further study at the graduate level in computer science.</AbstractNarration>
