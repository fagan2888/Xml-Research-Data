    <AbstractNarration>The union of TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) satellite measurements with CEDAR (Coupling Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions) ground-base measurements offers an unparalleled opportunity to explore the energetics and dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region (80-100 km). In particular, measurements will be made using the CEDAR Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (MTM) that is capable of quantitative investigations of intensity and temperature perturbations induced by a range of long and short-period gravity waves and tides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this CEDAR Post Doctoral application it is proposed that Dr. Alok Taori (a recent Ph.D. from the Physical Research Laboratories, India), will join the PI's group and will develop a leading role in the operation, analysis and interpretation of the MTM data obtained during the CEDAR-TIMED coordination program. Alok Taori has an excellent research record that is highly complementary to the PI's current research program and his experience in building, testing and operating airglow instrumentation will be most beneficial to the sustained success of this research program. He is already familiar with the methods of analysis of OH temperature data and has good computer skills necessary for further development of the existing software including new tools for near-simultaneous OH/O2 data reduction, analysis and presentation. Furthermore, his Ph.D. research experience with day-time OH instrumentation and measurements will be applied to the possible development of a new day-time OH capability at USU to complement the existing MTM measurements to provide novel and frequent 24-hr measurements of the MLT region.</AbstractNarration>
