    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to contribute to the development of a national science and engineering academic workforce that includes the full participation of women in all levels of faculty and academic administration, particularly at the senior academic ranks, through the transformation of institutional practices, policies, climate and culture. Through the Leadership Education for Advancement and Promotion Program (LEAP), the University of Colorado seeks to transform the makeup of the science and engineering faculties at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and to increase the number of women trained in the scientific, mathematical, engineering, and technology (SMET) disciplines serving in key administrative positions. The University of Colorado, Boulder seeks to improve the environment for all faculty members, by improving the level of managerial and leadership skills possessed by the faculty. Providing all the tools needed to work effectively will reduce the stresses commonly associated with achieving tenure. LEAP will therefore accelerate the promotion rate of women faculty by increasing retention rates and making their environment more supportive. The program is designed to keep faculty members on track for tenure, to identify potential leaders, and to give people more leadership opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is designed to work with efforts already underway at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Colorado. Formative evaluation of the program will maximize the effectiveness of the funds used over the lifetime of the program. At the end of the five-year period the University of Colorado, Boulder expects to have more women in leadership positions in the University. In addition, they will have trained a cadre of faculty better able to pursue long term change, and have developed an effective way to continue to train faculty for success. This program will permanently impact the institution and the changes it initiates will be self-sustainable through internal support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
