    <AbstractNarration>The advent of the exploding Internet and the terra-bytes of&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous data in it have made more acute the topic of searching&lt;br/&gt;such large digital databases. The challenges involved go beyond&lt;br/&gt;questions in information retrieval. One may envision seeking images in&lt;br/&gt;films, seeking words in voice data, and seeking phrases in compressed&lt;br/&gt;files and in files of various types.&lt;br/&gt;These challenges have boosted the appearance of myriad start-up&lt;br/&gt;companies and ad-hoc methods for the various tasks.&lt;br/&gt;The PI's approach has been a basic bottom-up long-term study of the&lt;br/&gt;theory of searching. They have a large center of pattern matching&lt;br/&gt;research that has pursued and continues to pursue understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical underpinnings of generalized searching, coupled with&lt;br/&gt;applications of their various ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;the current research will continue the investigation of issues in&lt;br/&gt;generalized searching. In particular:&lt;br/&gt; 1. Approximate indexing with a small number of errors.&lt;br/&gt; 2. In-place compressed search.&lt;br/&gt; 3. ``Reusable'' dynamic programming code.&lt;br/&gt; 4. Parameterized matching with ``don't care''s.&lt;br/&gt;Research on the theory of image processing will also be&lt;br/&gt;continued. The particular areas of concentration are: &lt;br/&gt; 1. The effect of digitization.&lt;br/&gt; 2. Real multi-dimensional scaling.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Efficient search of rotated images.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators' research group has started a program of selective&lt;br/&gt;implementation of advanced pattern matching ideas, some in conjunction&lt;br/&gt;with research groups from other application areas. There are plans to&lt;br/&gt;implement text fingerprinting ideas and test their applicability in&lt;br/&gt;IR. In addition a project is planned that incorporates many of the&lt;br/&gt;ideas on searching compressed and heterogeneous files by constructing&lt;br/&gt;an automatic scientific home-page generator and maintainer (guaranteed&lt;br/&gt;to be an instant hit with all professors of Computer Science!).</AbstractNarration>
