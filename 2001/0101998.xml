    <AbstractNarration>"Maricopa Mathematics Mentoring and Renewal," a four-year project of Maricopa Community College District (AZ) in collaboration with the Chandler School District, the Tempe Elementary School District, Tempe High School District, Chandler Gilbert Community College, and Arizona State University is designed to address the issues of continual need for new mathematics teachers due to both teacher turnover and continuous growth in population. Funded under the Teacher Enhancement guidelines for Teacher Retention and Renewal, the project focuses on preparing 81 teachers of grades 5-12 to serve as mentors/coaches to novice teachers. n additional 119 teachers participate in professional development activities and implement standards-based units while being mentored and coached by the mentor teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All project teachers participate in professional development activities designed to enhance both mathematical content and pedagogical practice. In addition, mentor teachers develop their skills in coaching and leading collegial support groups. Participating 5th - 8th grade teachers implement a minimum of two standards-based mathematics units. In the last two years, each middle school becomes a site for a collegial support group. Teachers from feeder elementary schools and cluster high schools are a part of the middle school based support group. Both mentor and novice teachers participate in content courses delivered through Arizona State University. A summer school practicum employs a mentoring/coaching model that engages teams of participants in planning lessons based on standards-based instructional strategies. The teaching is followed by reflection, re-planning, and re-teaching by another team member.</AbstractNarration>
