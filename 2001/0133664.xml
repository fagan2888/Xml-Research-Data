    <AbstractNarration>There is a growing scientific community working to provide solid&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and algorithmic foundations for the study of communication&lt;br/&gt;networks. This project furthers this goal through a combination of&lt;br/&gt;research and education. In particular, it addresses theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic issues that arise in a central area of networking: the&lt;br/&gt;efficient utilization of communication bandwidth. The research&lt;br/&gt;component of this project addresses several different approaches for&lt;br/&gt;the succinct representation of information in communication networks.&lt;br/&gt;This includes the investigation of (a) the efficient use of&lt;br/&gt;communication bits to provide accountability in the Internet (which is&lt;br/&gt;a means of combating cyber-terrorism), (b) new approaches to&lt;br/&gt;compression that arise in new communication technologies, and (c)&lt;br/&gt;minimizing the amount of control information required to make&lt;br/&gt;communication robust with respect to network faults. The integrated&lt;br/&gt;educational objectives of this project include both graduate student&lt;br/&gt;collaboration and curriculum development. The former consists of&lt;br/&gt;student involvement with the research component of the project, as&lt;br/&gt;well as organization of summer schools and workshops. The later&lt;br/&gt;includes the incorporation of networking topics into a graduate level&lt;br/&gt;algorithms course, as well as the development of a new advanced&lt;br/&gt;graduate course addressing the algorithmic and theoretical challenges&lt;br/&gt;and achievements in the area of networking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the research question of providing accountability in the Internet,&lt;br/&gt;this project studies the IP Traceback problem: given a stream of&lt;br/&gt;packets arriving at a node of the Internet, determine the source of&lt;br/&gt;those packets. This is an important tool for dealing with denial of&lt;br/&gt;service attacks, since accountability discourages such attacks and&lt;br/&gt;provides an automated mechanism for halting attacks in progress. This&lt;br/&gt;project studies probabilistic packet marking schemes for this problem,&lt;br/&gt;with the goal of determining the optimal tradeoffs between the number&lt;br/&gt;of marking bits used per packet, the number of packets required to&lt;br/&gt;reconstruct the source information, and the number of simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;sources of attack that can be dealt with. A number of new&lt;br/&gt;technologies also present us with entirely new approaches to&lt;br/&gt;compression. The resulting compression problems are fundamental, but&lt;br/&gt;since the motivating technologies have a short history, these problems&lt;br/&gt;have not been considered previously. In this project, we consider&lt;br/&gt;compression problems that arise from three such technologies:&lt;br/&gt;asymmetric communication channels, networks that are able to multicast&lt;br/&gt;information efficiently, and the compression of the World Wide Web.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, we also consider reducing bandwidth utilization by minimizing&lt;br/&gt;the amount of control information required to make communication&lt;br/&gt;robust against faults.</AbstractNarration>
