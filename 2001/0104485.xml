    <AbstractNarration>NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0104485&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Wave Interactions in Continuum Mechanics &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0104485&lt;br/&gt;Young, Robin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a study of nonlinear hyperbolic waves and their interactions. Waves are ubiquitous in science, and a general understanding of their interactions is of fundamental interest and importance. This project will systematically develop a dual framework for understanding waves and their interactions, via direct and asymptotic methods. Interacting pairs of waves are described in detail, and are combined in a coherent fashion to describe the structure of general solutions. These methods will be applied to several important systems of continuum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematical theory of waves lies at the intersection of mathematics and physics and has application to many engineering problems. This project develops methods for understanding the results of wave interactions in general systems. The results obtained in this study will be of use in experimentally measuring material properties of elastic solids.</AbstractNarration>
