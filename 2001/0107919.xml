    <AbstractNarration>0107918 Plummer The objective of this project is to evaluate the disinfecting capability of ultrasound for the inactivation of microorganisms in drinking water treatment, used alone and in conjunction with chlorination. Specific microbes to be tested are E. coli and F-specific coliphages. Chlorine has been chosen for this initial work because it is anticipated that sonication would have application at smaller drinking water treatment facilities that typically use chlorination for disinfection. Lower chlorine demand with sonication is expected to reduce the formation of disinfection by-products. Implementation of newer or more complicated disinfection technologies that reduce disinfection by-product formation, such as ozonation or UV radiation, may not be feasible for smaller drinking water utilities. The research will first be conducted using a synthetic water with the two proposed organisms to study the disinfection effectiveness in the absence of particulate matter, organic matter and other microorganisms; subsequent experiments will be conducted using Wachusett Reservoir water. The results of this work are expected to provide a basis for improving the disinfection of drinking water, particularly in smaller drinking water utilities that require disinfection strategies that are both simple and effective. ***</AbstractNarration>
