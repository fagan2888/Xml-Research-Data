    <AbstractNarration>Kesner lay abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years there has been an increasing interest in developing computational models of the hippocampus aimed at providing mechanisms for understanding the processing of mnemonic information. These processes include encoding, consolidation, and retrieval as well as pattern separation, short-term and intermediate memory, pattern association, and pattern completion. The hippocampus is a very complex brain region that can be subdivided into a number of different subregions, including dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1. The computational models emphasize subregional specificity of function based primarily on anatomical and physiological recording data, but rarely take into account behavioral data. The purpose of this grant proposal is to determine whether there is subregional specificity of function within the hippocampus using neurotoxic lesion techniques to ensure specificity of lesion effects in conjunction with behavioral paradigms designed to measure encoding, consolidation, and retrieval as well as pattern separation, short-term and intermediate memory, pattern association, and pattern completion processes. The outcome of this research should provide for some critical tests of the assumptions made by computational models and should aid in the understanding of the multiple mnemonic functions of the hippocampus.</AbstractNarration>
