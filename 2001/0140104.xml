    <AbstractNarration>The Algebra Problem: US Mathematics Education has an increasingly difficult in Algebra&lt;br/&gt;Problems to solve. The standard indicators of student achievements international comparisons, NAEP&lt;br/&gt;and other national measures, as well as state test results all point in the direction of lower achievement&lt;br/&gt;as grade levels increase. Well-known TIMSS analyses of US curricula point in the direction of repetition&lt;br/&gt;of elementary skill building and superficiality of topic coverage as important contributors to the problem,&lt;br/&gt;combined with tell-and-drill pedagogy that puts students in overly passive position as learners. And, of&lt;br/&gt;course, high failure rates in first year algebra courses contribute to alienation on the part of students and&lt;br/&gt;low morale among teachers. Responses involve a wide variety, but largely ineffective tactics involving&lt;br/&gt;middle and early high school curricula: pre-algebra courses of various kinds, screening and diagnostic&lt;br/&gt;tests, district and state mandates that all students take Algebra I, lengthened courses, modifying the&lt;br/&gt;definition of if algebra, creating different versions of if algebra, end-of-course exams, among others.&lt;br/&gt;Each adjustment produces small improvements, although, since the tactics tend to be ad hoc and&lt;br/&gt;implemented independently, improvements do not accumulate or multiply. NCTM recommendations for&lt;br/&gt;integrating the development of algebraic reasoning across K-12 are implemented only in a few of the&lt;br/&gt;standards-based curricula, and these mainly at the middle school level.&lt;br/&gt;Research Towards Solutions: Several research teams studying the development of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;reasoning in the early (K-5) grades, who are represented in this proposal, have formed an informal&lt;br/&gt;research collaborative, renewing a prior collaboration funded by the US DoE OERI in the early/mid&lt;br/&gt;1990. These researchers share broad hypotheses regarding the large positive potential of building&lt;br/&gt;algebraic reasoning in the context of elementary mathematics, the need to exploit untapped student&lt;br/&gt;learning capacities among younger students, the powerful role of generalization and formalization in&lt;br/&gt;deepening students experience and understanding of elementary mathematics especially arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;and the potential for using changes in the curricular relationships between algebra and elementary&lt;br/&gt;mathematics as a catalyst and vehicle for faculty development of elementary teachers. These researchers&lt;br/&gt;are engaged in several complementary lines of work focusing on different aspects of the challenges&lt;br/&gt;student learning, classroom practice, curriculum development, professional development, capacity&lt;br/&gt;building, and so on.&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Combination of Travel, Conferences and Monograph: The collaborating researchers&lt;br/&gt;have all been invited to present papers to an important conference to be held December 8-15, 2001, in&lt;br/&gt;Melbourne, Australia on The Future of the Teaching and Learning of Algebra which is being sponsored&lt;br/&gt;by the International Commission on Mathematics Instruction. Professor Kaput has been designated to&lt;br/&gt;Co-Chair the Early Algebra Group at the conference. We request funds to exploit, in 3 ways, this unique&lt;br/&gt;opportunity to bring an intensely international perspective to bear upon our active research program: (1)&lt;br/&gt;To support travel to the international conference. (2) To hold two meetings in the US, one prior to and&lt;br/&gt;one following the Melbourne conference, involving a slightly larger group of mathematics educators&lt;br/&gt;working in this area. (3) To write and publish a monograph expressing our findings in order to inform&lt;br/&gt;policy makers, curriculum developers and assessment builders of the latest developments in this rapidly&lt;br/&gt;changing field. Hence we also request a small amount of funding for editorial work to pull together and&lt;br/&gt;publicize the monograph, which in turn will point to additional web resources illustrating relevant&lt;br/&gt;research.</AbstractNarration>
