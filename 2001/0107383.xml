    <AbstractNarration>0107383&lt;br/&gt;Graf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four month postdoctoral research fellowship for Dr. Erich Graf to work with Dr. Martin Lages at the University of Glasgow in Scotland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The perception of motion is one of the most important features of low-level information processing shared with all seeing creatures. While tremendous advancements in our understanding of motion processing in the cortex have occurred in the past decades, many issues are left unresolved. One issue concerns the location along the processing pathway where the integration of binocular motion information occurs. The work proposed uses psychophysical and computational approaches to attempt to find an answer. The PI and his host will use the results obtained from their investigations as well as other relevant motion literature to extend simulation studies of single cell responses to populations of binocular simple and complex cells using new algorithms inspired by analogous work in the field of audition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Department of Psychology at the University of Glasgow has an ideal group of researchers who will work with Dr. Graf on this project. They include researchers in the areas of ophthalmology, psychophysics and computational vision.</AbstractNarration>
