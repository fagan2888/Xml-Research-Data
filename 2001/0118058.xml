    <AbstractNarration>Spilhaus, A. Frederick&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0118058&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funds for a Chapman Conference on Exploration Geodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to promote opportunities not normally available through the format of larger meetings. Funds will be used to support participant travel expenses. Travel grants will be made on a competitive and need basis. The convenors expect to issue approximately 12 awards at an average of $1,000 per award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conveners of the conference seek to bring together an international cross section of the geodynamics modeling community, with the likely industry beneficiaries of "exploration geodynamics" in mineral and petroleum exploration. The targeted audience will be leading practitioners of geodynamic modeling, exploration managers and scientists from exploration divisions of leading resource companies, and, to catalyze the interaction, consultants and academics who have been instrumental in bringing basic science through to industry. Graduate students will be strongly encouraged to attend through a reduced registration fee and preferential access to travel grants.</AbstractNarration>
