    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael Nikolaou and Brian McMillan &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Houston&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0118516&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing functionality and wafer sizes are challenging integrated circuit manufacturing practices that rely on the execution of open-loop recipes. To ensure high yields, reliable sensor-based methods for the prevention, detection and correction (control) of abnormal situations are gradually being used and need to be further developed. To that end, this four-month GOALI project will serve to catalyze interaction between the microelectronics industry and the University of Houston, providing important input to the PI's future work in the area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will be conducted at Lam Research Corporation's facilities and will focus on plasma etching. Two commercial software products will be used to determine the potential for yield improvements on the basis of prevention, detection, and correction (control) methods that use data provided by sensors in existing tools. The limits of software-based methods will be examined, and promising directions will be outlined for short and long-term development of sensor, monitoring, and control systems for plasma etching yield improvements. Continuation of this work will be further pursued after the PI returns to his academic position.</AbstractNarration>
