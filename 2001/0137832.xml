    <AbstractNarration>0137832&lt;br/&gt;Gough&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrestrial arctic research has tended to focus on plant populations or the entire ecosystem, with community patterns and processes less well studied, generating a lack of predictive ability of effects of climate change on different arctic plant communities and potential biotic feedbacks to an altered environment. This proposal seeks better understanding of vegetation patterns at the community level as well as of how processes at the ecosystem level are influenced by plant community composition. The PI currently has two NSF-funded research grants. One project is examining two common arctic plant communities in northern Alaska, moist acidic and moist non-acidic tundra. By monitoring plant responses to nutrient and temperature manipulations in both communities, and conducting experiments to examine germination and survival of important species, the PI is determining how the communities are maintained and how they respond differently to manipulations. The differences are being linked to ecosystem function through collaboration with an ecosystem ecologist. The second NSF grant is examining competition among seven clonal sedge species in southeastern Michigan calcareous wetlands. Although clonal growth is the dominant method of production of new individuals by plants in many ecosystems, including tundra, its effects on plant community structure remain unclear. Using community and individual-level experiments, the PI is examining both short- and long-term effects of competition among species that differ in clonal growth form; the results of this project are being used to generate new hypotheses to be tested in arctic plant communities. From this work, the population-level processes that have been well documented for some arctic plant species can be explicitly linked to the community and the ecosystem, thus providing better understanding of patterns and processes at all levels of organization, as well as predictions for biotic feedbacks to the changing arctic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is supported through the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
