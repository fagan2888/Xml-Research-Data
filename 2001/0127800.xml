    <AbstractNarration>The MASTEP (Mathematics And Science Teacher Education Program), funded under the NSF Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher preparation program is continuing three crucial activities of the large and successful project. Under the leadership of San Jose State University, MASTEP includes San Francisco State University (the other teacher preparation program), four Community Colleges (City College of San Francisco, College of San Mateo, Evergreen Valley College, and San Jose City College), several local school districts, several local institutions for informal education, and several local supportive industries within the San Francisco Bay area. The project is evaluating the lasting impacts of MASTEP while also sharing experiences with colleagues nationwide through dissemination activities. In order to evaluate the teaching practices and leadership roles of MASTEP mathematics and science teacher graduates through their first 3-5 years in classroom teaching, the project is continuing the New Teacher Support Networks at both San Jose and San Francisco State Universities. Network activities include teaming the new teachers with local mentoring teachers, partial day workshops on relevant topics to teaching and leadership, and one residential workshop per semester to further network the new teachers together while promoting additional reform strategies. Dissemination activities consist of expanding the project's website to include rich descriptions of all of the major course revisions that have been funded by MASTEP. Accompanying many of these descriptions will be evaluation data on the impact of the course revisions or other activities. Faculty presentations on reform efforts are targeting Arts and Science faculty to inform such faculty of the project's successes and to encourage other faculty to embark on similar reforms. Evaluation efforts are leading to a summative assessment of the lasting impacts of MASTEP on students, instructors, and institutions. The evaluation is coordinated with the CETP Core Evaluation effort . The anticipated outcome of this project is a well documented assessment of the features of MASTEP that have had important and lasting impacts, especially on the new teachers produced and on the college/university faculty related to teaching practices, leadership roles, advances in personnel careers, and institutional reform.</AbstractNarration>
