    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;The Transformation 2005 Program of the Department of Biology, Chemistry and Enviromnental Science is impacting the entire four-year biology curriculum at Christopher Newport University (CNU). Research-based experimental systems (RBES) developed by Research Link 2000 are forming the backbone of this transformation, providing fast-growing plants and biologically informative animals with which the concepts learned in lecture can be explored in an engaging, investigative, open-ended format. The sea anemone and Wisconsin Fast Plant RBES are the initial systems that will be introduced. Additional RBES are being investigated and incorporated as an ongoing aspect of the project. The transformation begins with the general biology lab course that is taken by over 700 majors and nonmajors each year, engaging students in the process of science from their first semester. It moves in steps through each level in the biology curriculum until courses in all four undergraduate years are changed and independent research opportunities are varied and readily pursued. Simultaneous with the transformation of the curriculum is the training of doctoral candidates who aspire to university careers. These candidates, six selected from regional doctoral programs each year and awarded Bartholomew Gosnold Instructorships, are being mentored in the use of RBES and guided in becoming exciting and productive college faculty. The lessons of Transformation 2005 are being extended to regional college biology faculty and to local middle and high school biology teachers in a series of intensive workshops.</AbstractNarration>
