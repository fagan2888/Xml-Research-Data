    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this scholarship project is to help produce additional computer science graduates to meet industry demands. Computer science graduates from the college have been successful in both industry and graduate school, and the college has a very strong relationship with the local technology-related industry. The curriculum in computer science has been evaluated and refined recently by both internal and external reviewers and shown to produce high quality graduates. Students also have the opportunity to participate in a variety of service activities, including community service. The program is producing graduates who are making a contribution to the computing profession by maintaining high standards and a rigorous curriculum that has evolved with the changes in the discipline. Programs like this project are enabling the college to further leverage the almost 20 year investment in computer science by increasing retention and enrollment.</AbstractNarration>
