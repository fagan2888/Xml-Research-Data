    <AbstractNarration>There is a significant theoretical literature in economics that identifies various ways through&lt;br/&gt;which providing more information to consumers may lead to improvements in market effciency&lt;br/&gt;and consumer welfare in particular. The theoretical insights provide a basis for government&lt;br/&gt;policies that seek to increase the amount of information available to consumers. Examples of&lt;br/&gt;such policies include food labeling laws, accounting disclosure rules and energy effciency labels&lt;br/&gt;on home applicances. Meanwhile existing empirical studies into the effects of information to&lt;br/&gt;consumers on firm behavior find small or negligible effects, casting doubt on the importance of&lt;br/&gt;such policies. In this project, we analyze a regulatory change that provides an appealing context&lt;br/&gt;for evaluating the effects of increased product information on firms' product quality choices and&lt;br/&gt;disclosure decisions.&lt;br/&gt;In 1998, Los Angeles County introduced hygiene quality grade cards to be displayed in restaurant&lt;br/&gt;windows. The regulatory change provides an experiment in whether firms are subject to volun-&lt;br/&gt;tary disclosure (of hygiene quality) without verifiability, voluntary disclosure with verifiability&lt;br/&gt;or mandatory disclosure. Our research indicates substantial effects of the increased information&lt;br/&gt;on restaurant hygiene quality. We also find that the effects from mandatory disclosure are very&lt;br/&gt;similar to the effects from voluntary verifiable disclosure. A possible implication of this finding&lt;br/&gt;is that mandatory disclosure laws (which could be hard to introduce due to lobbying by indus-&lt;br/&gt;try groups) are less important than having the government provide mechanisms/procedures for&lt;br/&gt;firms to voluntarily disclose verifiable product information.&lt;br/&gt;The richness of our dataset allows us to also analyze how the effects of the grade cards differ&lt;br/&gt;across restaurants. This is interesting because we can address questions that have received&lt;br/&gt;little or no attention in the existing empirical literature, such as: (i) does reputation help firms&lt;br/&gt;to overcome adverse selection problems, (ii) do franchised chain-restaurants free-ride on chain&lt;br/&gt;reputation, and (iii) what is the effect of the increased product information on firms' profitability&lt;br/&gt;and market structure?</AbstractNarration>
