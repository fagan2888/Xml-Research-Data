    <AbstractNarration>Hodgins&lt;br/&gt;0125537&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports American participation in the first Asia-Pacific Advanced Studies Institute. The meeting will take place in Tokyo from July 20-29, 2001 on the subject of "New Frontiers in Intelligent Robotics." The general purpose of this meeting, and of those that hopefully will follow, is to bring young, promising researchers from around the Pacific together with their senior mentors and colleagues to discuss a leading area of scientific research. It is hoped that by meeting for an extended period of time the participants will be able to engage in in-depth discussions and that they will form lasting professional ties. The objective for the younger American participants is to provide them with a significant international experience in their field that will encourage them to think globally about their research careers.</AbstractNarration>
