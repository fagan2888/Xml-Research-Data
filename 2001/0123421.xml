    <AbstractNarration>The need for more bandwidth and capacity in wireless systems currently is the main culprit for the&lt;br/&gt;great interest in the development of wireless communications systems operating at millimeter wave&lt;br/&gt;frequencies and higher. The future needs of broad-band interactive services (1Gb/s) demand the&lt;br/&gt;application of optical fiber feed networks for distribution of the radio signals to and from the antennas at&lt;br/&gt;the various base stations. Fiber-optic technologies have reached the stage where insertions into various&lt;br/&gt;commercial RF systems are being considered. Today, there are three main steps in the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;RF/Photonics systems for wireless communications. The first step has been in the direction of using&lt;br/&gt;photonics to slowly replace conventional RF components, such as, the coax that is used to interconnect&lt;br/&gt;the antenna to the electronics. Optical fibers, in contrast to coaxial cable, provide a more ideal medium for&lt;br/&gt;broadband RF communication systems. The light weight property of fibers, and its immunity from other&lt;br/&gt;signal interference make them very critical in the development of future RF distribution systems. The&lt;br/&gt;second, and more challenging step, is in the seamless integration of photonics and RF wireless circuits.&lt;br/&gt;The challenge in this step is to use photonics and RF circuits as complementary systems and blend them&lt;br/&gt;together. Finally, the third step is towards the development of optically coupled antennas. In this step the&lt;br/&gt;aim is to eliminate the need of local oscillators, mixers, amplifiers and a host of other parts by directly&lt;br/&gt;feeding an antenna through a fiber at millimeter wave frequencies.&lt;br/&gt; Here, it is proposed that an array of RF modulator/photodetectors be integrated directly to an array&lt;br/&gt;of antennas. This new RF/photonic antenna array system, with the appropriate space-time processing and&lt;br/&gt;coding, will form a iosmart antennaln that can enhance network coverage, capacity, and quality. It is&lt;br/&gt;envisioned that a large number of such RF/Photonic antenna elements could be networked together into a&lt;br/&gt;star configuration, feeding in and out of a radio hub.&lt;br/&gt; As a transmitter, the proposed optoelectronic device operates as a photodiode, while as a receiver&lt;br/&gt;the device operates as an optical modulator. It has already been demonstrated that this dual function of a&lt;br/&gt;semiconductor electroabsorption modulator and photodiode in the same device for duplex operation, can&lt;br/&gt;occur, using bias control as a transmit/receive mode control. For full duplex operation, two&lt;br/&gt;modulator/photodiode devices need to be incorporated in the each transceiver element.&lt;br/&gt; We propose to directly drive a coplanar waveguide (CPW)-fed slot antenna by converting optical&lt;br/&gt;power into microwave power and vice versa using these RF modulator/photodetectors. As a transmitter,&lt;br/&gt;the CPW line is connected to the active surface of the photodetector, from which the microwave power&lt;br/&gt;propagates to feed the radiating slot. The photodetector is fed via an optical fiber from beneath. When the&lt;br/&gt;device functions as an optical modulator, the receive function can also be achieved. Preliminary results&lt;br/&gt;for a single antenna show that a very good bandwidth and radiation patterns can be achieved.&lt;br/&gt; It should be noted that these elements can be interconnected via the fiber to achieve summation,&lt;br/&gt;mixing and other signal processing functions, at the antenna site or at a remote site. Some preliminary&lt;br/&gt;results have been achieved in the area of multiple functionality for the optoelectronic components, such as&lt;br/&gt;modulation, photodetection, self-biasing and RF frequency mixing. They have shown properties, such as&lt;br/&gt;high bandwidth and high power, that are desirable for the antenna applications. A main emphasis here is&lt;br/&gt;to further investigate the material and device designs for the optoelectronic component that can&lt;br/&gt;incorporate into the smart antenna architecture.&lt;br/&gt; The proposed approach will have significant impacts on wireless communication systems by&lt;br/&gt;providing higher system bandwidth capacity and enhancing their reliability. It may lead to a new type of&lt;br/&gt;long distance, broadband network infrastructure that supports transparent transport of optical signals.&lt;br/&gt; Our team is formed to provide the expertise in the four key elements for this proposed research.&lt;br/&gt;Our project will provide a good opportunity to train graduate and undergraduate students in one of the&lt;br/&gt;most exciting interdisciplinary areas in science (RF, photonics, signal processing and communications).&lt;br/&gt;The interactions between the researchers at the different institutions will be aided by the close&lt;br/&gt;collaboration that exists between the members of the group.</AbstractNarration>
