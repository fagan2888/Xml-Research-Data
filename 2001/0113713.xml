    <AbstractNarration>0113713&lt;br/&gt;Williams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Subduction zones comprise a large percentage of the tectonic plate boundaries on earth and they produce the largest and most devastating earthquakes. Large amounts of surface geodetic data are collected in these regions to estimate seismic hazard and to understand the mechanics of convergent margins. The amount and quality of such data has increased rapidly in recent years but the development of sophisticated and easy-to-use modeling tools has not proceeded at a similar pace. Although sophisticated modeling techniques exist, they are not generally easy to use and are not readily available to the same scientists collecting geodetic data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a project to develop web-based tools that will provide comprehensive solutions for geoscientists wishing to model surface deformation at subduction zones. This will allow general access to more powerful modeling techniques (the finite element method) while offering significant ease-of-use. Despite the increase in the quality and quantity of geodetic data, most researchers still rely on older modeling techniques in their analyses. The goal of this project is to provide a modeling environment that improves upon current methods while still being easy to use, thus allowing geoscientists to focus more on interpretation than on model development.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
