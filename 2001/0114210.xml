    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program, the University of Maryland will be able to acquire a combined scanning probe/scanning electron microscope. The instrument will be used to address critical issues of nano-electronics due to the variability of nano-device electronic properties with structure. This issue is critical, for instance, in assessing how or whether electrical contacts to nano-devices, structural defects in the devices, or even thermal fluctuations will limit nano-device performance and reproducibility. It is also key to developing applications of nano-structures that derive from their intrinsic properties: i.e. where strong variations of device properties with structure and/or local environment are a natural characteristic, these properties may be exploited as response mechanisms. Techniques to image the atomic structure of nanostructures while simultaneously measuring electronic transport properties will be developed. These experiments will establish the correlations between structure and the electronic properties of nanodevices, by probing the effects of dynamic changes in structure (driven by temperature, electric field, current and chemical potential) on the electrical transport properties of the nanodevices. The relationship between structure and the electrical response of nanostructures will also be investigated theoretically. The new instrument, a combined scanning probe/scanning electron microscope will also be used for graduate student training in the research areas described above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Important new technological properties are expected to occur in materials structures as their size approaches the nanoscale. Location of such small structures to allow the direct measurement of their properties is a serious technical challenge, as is the measurement itself. This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program will help the University of Maryland with the purchase of an instrument that combines two microscopes and a fine positioning stage. One microscope will be used to locate small structures, and the scanning stage will be used to move the small structures into the measurement range of the second microscope. The second microscope will be an ultra-high resolution microscope with the capability of imaging the positions of individual atoms. Experiments will be performed in which the effect of changes in the positions of individual atoms in small structures are correlated with the electrical properties (e.g. the ability to carry electrical current) of the small structures. The new instrument will also be used for graduate student training in the research areas described above.</AbstractNarration>
