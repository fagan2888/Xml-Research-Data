    <AbstractNarration>David Stanbury of Auburn University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry program for research on kinetics and mechanisms of reactions in solutions (mainly aqueous) that involve redox changes of elements of the main group of the periodic table. One main aim of the research is to clarify the mechanisms of aqueous solution reactions that involve oxidation of thiols by direct ('outer sphere') electron transfer from oxidants. A second main area will involve outer sphere oxidation of iodide ion in aprotic non-aqueous solvents. A third problem area involves investigations of aqueous outer-sphere oxidation of hydroxlyamine and thiocyanate ion. Spectroscopic (including stopped flow) and electrochemical techniques will be employed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research deals with the fundamental processes that determine whether the reactions of rather simple main-group element compounds that occur in aqueous media are fast or slow. Although such reactions have been studied for more than a century, many fundamental aspects of their reaction dynamics have only recently become accessible, through the use of recently developed techniques and instruments. Reactions of such species as iodide ion are involved in vast numbers of processes of the highest industrial and biological importance, but the subtle factors that determine the kinetics of these reactions are for the most part quite obscure. Research carried out under this program has high intrinsic interest, and will also lead to understanding that will be applicable in many related research areas.</AbstractNarration>
