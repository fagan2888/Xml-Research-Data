    <AbstractNarration>IIS-0117493&lt;br/&gt;Carl H. Smith, University of Maryland&lt;br/&gt;$8,500 - 12 mos (joint funding with IDM program, total awad $17,000)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discovery Science 2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard award to provide funding for 2 plenary speakers and up to 10 graduate students attending the fourth conference on Discovery Science to be held in Washington DC in November 2001. The goal of the new field of Discovery Science is to automate (as much as possible) the process by which scientific insights are distilled from large data sets. The intellectual scope of the field is very broad, covering topics from philosophy, logic, automated reasoning and computational learning theory, as well as empirical investigations of various implemented discovery algorithms. An important contribution of the conferences is that they assemble a wide range of perspectives on the process of discovery in the hopes of generating synergy. This year's conference will be the first to be held in this country, and the PI is the local organizer of the meeting. Student participants will be selected by the Steering Committee from among the student authors, based primarily on the rankings of the papers by the Program Committee but moderated slightly by a desire to achieve diversity. The two invited speakers will be senior researchers from related fields, chosen by the Steering Committee with a view to building bridges to related research communities.</AbstractNarration>
