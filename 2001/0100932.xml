    <AbstractNarration>This project is addressing the need to improve the mathematics learning environment in two-year colleges by generating increased student enthusiasm in the exploration and applications of mathematics and by attracting more students to science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET) fields of study. The overall project goal is to provide faculty with a complete package of information and materials for establishing and conducting an interdisciplinary course for the study of mathematics. The package includes (a) ten laboratory exercises, each having a technology problem, a bibliotechnology research exercise, a method to develop the mathematics tools required to solve the problem, a model portfolio, and a thesis defense; (b) initiation of a marketing plan; and (c) initiation of a management plan. Means to accomplish the project objectives involve in-kind support from the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC), Texas Instruments, and Capital Community College. Twenty AMATYC faculty members have been selected to produce the ten laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project outcomes include a laboratory, marketing, and management plan, all of which are being compiled into The Math Works Resource Book, to be published in hard copy and via the Internet. This project is offering a multitude of professional enhancement opportunities to those who develop or use the products developed through this project.</AbstractNarration>
