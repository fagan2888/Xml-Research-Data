    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes development of a magnetically controlled and microwave powered fluidized bed reactor, incorporating three primary innovations: [1] highly energy efficient waveguide-based microwave transmission and irradiation of fluidized media, [2] unique self-regulation of fluidized bed temperature using a localized magnetic field gradient and the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility to confine only relatively cold particles within the heating zone, and [3] a novel microwave-compatible temperature measurement system. The temperature dependence of the benefits of microwave heating have been applied to a vast array of chemical syntheses and related unit operations. However, most work to date has been conducted using relatively inefficient multi-mode cavities with poor temperature control. The innovation couples the excellent mass transfer efficiency of Fluidized Bed Reactors (FBRs) with the vastly superior heat transfer efficiencies achievable using high performance waveguide-based microwave irradiation systems. Anticipated benefits include: 1) energy savings resulting from improved thermal efficiency, 2) much faster reactor start-up due to substantially improved heating rates, 3) improved temperature uniformity, 4) improved control of reactor operating temperature, 5) development of novel magnetically controlled particles, and 6) greater understanding of the heat transfer characteristics in fluidized bed reactors. &lt;br/&gt;The successful coupling of optimal heat transfer and mass transfer characteristics with novel temperature control materials can be utilized to improve reactor efficiency and reduce costs. It is most probable that small-scale laboratory units will be the first commercial product</AbstractNarration>
