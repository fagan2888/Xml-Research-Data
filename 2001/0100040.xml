    <AbstractNarration>Theory revision is the correcting of a given, roughly correct rule,&lt;br/&gt;also known as a concept or theory. This problem arises frequently in&lt;br/&gt;machine learning, for instance, when the initial output of an &lt;br/&gt;expert system is not correct, and when the machine learning&lt;br/&gt;problem is too large or too complex to solve from scratch, and an&lt;br/&gt;approximately correct rule is needed to jump-start the learning&lt;br/&gt;process. There has been considerable ad hoc building of theory &lt;br/&gt;revision systems, but the theory is poorly understood. This research&lt;br/&gt;investigates fundamental mathematical possibilities and limitations&lt;br/&gt;of efficient theory revision. It is hoped that as a result of&lt;br/&gt;this research, theory revision in computational learning theory will&lt;br/&gt;emerge as a general framework for the study of learning situations&lt;br/&gt;where a large amount of initial information is available or&lt;br/&gt;necessary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the PIs investigate the following areas: extensions&lt;br/&gt;of their previous work on propositional logic theory revision&lt;br/&gt;with queries, relations to certificate complexity and&lt;br/&gt;attribute-efficient learning, revision problems for predicate logic&lt;br/&gt;representations, and both the learning and revising of categorial &lt;br/&gt;grammars.</AbstractNarration>
