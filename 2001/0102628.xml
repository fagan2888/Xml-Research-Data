    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS 0102628&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Leonid FayBusovich, Department of Mathematics,&lt;br/&gt; University of Notre Dame&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI analyzes geometric and algebraic structures arising in connection &lt;br/&gt;with optimization problems. The major goal is to further expand the &lt;br/&gt;domain of applications of interior-point algorithms. A method based on &lt;br/&gt;the theory of random matrices is proposed to calculate characteristic &lt;br/&gt;functions of cones generated by Chebyshev systems and thus &lt;br/&gt;self-concordant barriers for these cones. This drastically expands the &lt;br/&gt;domain of applicability of interior-point algorithms. In particular, &lt;br/&gt;possible applications to spline approximations are outlined. A general &lt;br/&gt;approach to the construction of self-concordant barriers for a broad &lt;br/&gt;class of infinite-dimensional domains is proposed. The technique of &lt;br/&gt;JB-algebras is suggested to carry over the recent impressive &lt;br/&gt;applications of the theory of Euclidean Jordan algebras to symmetric &lt;br/&gt;programming to the infinite-dimensional situation. Possible control &lt;br/&gt;applications are outlined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of interior-point algorithms provides a general framework &lt;br/&gt;for the analysis of a broad class of extremely efficient optimization &lt;br/&gt;algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve problems aiming at &lt;br/&gt;finding the best possible solutions under various constraints (e.g. &lt;br/&gt;time constraints , available resources e.t.c ). The realization of &lt;br/&gt;the project will enable us to drastically expand a class of problems &lt;br/&gt;that can be solved with the help of powerful modern computers.</AbstractNarration>
