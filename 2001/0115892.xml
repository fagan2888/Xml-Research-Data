    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Stone at Southern Oregon University to purchase major instrumentation for the establishment of an interdepartmental biotechnology center. Equipment includes a genetic analyzer (automated DNA sequencer), superspeed centrifuge, autoclave, chromatography cabinet, water filtration system, vacufuge concentrator, incubated shaker, microfuge, circulating baths, incubator, fume hood, and safety hood. Faculty in the biology and chemistry departments will develop a biotechnology center to create a supportive work environment without need for duplication of equipment. This center will house equipment and supplies needed for diverse research activities using molecular methods, provide functional bench space, and serve as a forum for interaction between faculty and students working on diverse projects that share common methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted on a range of organisms including bacteria, higher plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates. Research training will be extended to faculty and students who may update or expand their skills in molecular techniques. The areas that will be investigated span from biochemistry, developmental biology, and environmental microbiology to molecular systematics, conservation genetics, population biology, and molecular evolution. Specific research projects include:&lt;br/&gt;a. identifying and monitoring bacterial levels in local streams and determining possible pollution sources. &lt;br/&gt;b. studying the evolution of American martens using DNA sequencing and the taxonomic status of a rare subspecies of martens found in California.&lt;br/&gt;c. identifying bacteria associated with an exposed vein of pyrite and other bacteria involved in acid drainage from pyrite. &lt;br/&gt;d. developing an inexpensive, reliable method of producing high volumes of conotoxins, which are possible models for future pharmaceuticals due to their biochemical properties.&lt;br/&gt;e. investigating the roles of specific genes in the development of garden peas.&lt;br/&gt;f. investigating the evolutionary development of floral components.&lt;br/&gt;g. studying the genetics of variants of noble firs and firs found on Mt. Shasta which may represent hybrids between California red firs and noble firs.&lt;br/&gt;examining diversity of plant and microbial species on serpentine soils which have high concentrations of heavy metals such as nickel, cadmium, and chromium.&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the structure and function of common mycorrhizal networks on white oak.&lt;br/&gt;Southern Oregon University is a small, non-Ph.D. granting university whose faculty is primarily engaged in teaching. As a small college focused on quality undergraduate education with a relatively high faculty to student ratio (1:18), their students have the opportunity to be mentored individually by faculty in a way that is usually only available to graduate students. This represents a great advantage to those students who wish to explore laboratory research. All students have the opportunity to do research, and much of this research is carried out as senior capstone projects. In addition, increasing numbers of students are attracted to the prospect of jobs in biotechnology fields and the new frontiers biotechnology makes available to medicine. This biotechnology center will provide students with saleable skills needed to attain tech-level positions in industry or to further their education by attending graduate or medical school.</AbstractNarration>
