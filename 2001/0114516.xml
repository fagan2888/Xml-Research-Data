    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this research is to increase our understanding of the early career&lt;br/&gt;development of girls as they form opinions, develop belief structures, and make &lt;br/&gt;decisions about career options in science, mathematics, engineering, and/or technology &lt;br/&gt;careers by expanding our theoretical framework and empirical base to include a more&lt;br/&gt;direct focus on the influence of outcome expectations, perceived barriers, and &lt;br/&gt;perceived support.&lt;br/&gt;The need to conduct inquiry into the role of outcome beliefs in the development, stability,&lt;br/&gt; and change in career interests, and to examine contextual factors that&lt;br/&gt; impact the eventual entry of young girls and women into the pipeline toward pursuing &lt;br/&gt;scientific and technical careers provides the framework for the research.&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant involves the recruitment and commitment of several &lt;br/&gt;collaborating researchers, research institutions, and school systems. Collaborative&lt;br/&gt; researchers will provide the expertise across the disciplines of counseling, &lt;br/&gt;educational psychology , and science. Collaboration across institutions will provide &lt;br/&gt;the opportunity for multiple sites to bring existing resources to bear on the problem&lt;br/&gt; and allow for research across widely varying demographics and locations. Multiple&lt;br/&gt; school systems will contribute to the opportunity to generalize to populations of rural, &lt;br/&gt;suburban, and urban youth, as well as varying socioeconomic groups.&lt;br/&gt;The planning year will include the identification of a sufficiently large and diverse&lt;br/&gt; sample of girls, and the design and pilot testing of both qualitative and quantitative&lt;br/&gt; instrumentation. This study will use a multimethod approach to examine the outcome &lt;br/&gt;expectations and perceived barriers and supports ofgirls, ages 10-14, the impact of&lt;br/&gt; these expectations on career-related interests, and, if funded through a future grant,&lt;br/&gt;the development of these interestS and outcome expectations over time. Focus groups&lt;br/&gt;will be used to identify factors to be used in the development of items for several &lt;br/&gt;Q-sorts and to be incorporated into assessment tools. Quantitative instruments that&lt;br/&gt;will measure the constructs of interest will be designed, when necessary , revised&lt;br/&gt;when appropriate, and then pilot tested with middle school youth.</AbstractNarration>
