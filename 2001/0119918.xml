In this follow-on project, a long term summative evaluation is being conducted that is 1) documenting the effectiveness of the original grant activities, and 2) contributing to the CORE evaluation project that is serving all projects funded in the NSF Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation Program.

As triangulation, the evaluation is employing several tests and measures specific to Oklahoma students that have been part of previous evaluations and are closely associated with educational advancement and curriculum reform.
