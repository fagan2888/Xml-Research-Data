    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the dynamics of partially hyperbolic systems.&lt;br/&gt;It is hoped to improve the recent theorem of Pugh and Shub by weakening the&lt;br/&gt;center bunching hypothesis and adapting the proof so that it applies to the&lt;br/&gt;pointwise (or Brazilian) version of partial hyperbolicity rather than more&lt;br/&gt;stringent uniform assumptions made by Pugh and Shub. I also hope to extend&lt;br/&gt;the classes of partially hyperbolic maps within which the hypotheses of the&lt;br/&gt;Pugh-Shub theorem are known to hold generically by studying compact group&lt;br/&gt;extensions of the compact group extensions already studied by myself and&lt;br/&gt;Wilkinson. In addition I plan to continue my work with Paternain on&lt;br/&gt;magnetic flows and to collaborate with Hasselblatt and Wilkinson on a&lt;br/&gt;study of Lyapunov exponents for geodesic flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will study the dynamics of partially hyperbolic systems.&lt;br/&gt;A differentiable dynamical system consists of a differentiable manifold which&lt;br/&gt;represents the possible states of the system and a differentiable map of the&lt;br/&gt;manifold to itself which represents the evolution of the system from its&lt;br/&gt;current state to its next state. A basic mechanism which tends to produce&lt;br/&gt;chaotic behavior is for the derivative of the map to stretch vectors in&lt;br/&gt;some directions and to shrink vectors in the complementary directions.&lt;br/&gt;Such behavior is called hyperbolicity. The system is called partially&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic if in addition to the expanding and contracting directions&lt;br/&gt;that are stretched and shrunk there is a third direction which is stretched&lt;br/&gt;less than the expanding direction and shrunk less than the contracting.&lt;br/&gt;It has long been suspected that most partially hyperbolic systems should&lt;br/&gt;have the same chaotic behavior as fully hyperbolic systems.&lt;br/&gt;In the 1990's the work of Pugh and Shub (in collaboration with Grayson&lt;br/&gt;and Wilkinson) has made it possible to prove this in considerable generality.&lt;br/&gt;I aim to extend their work, by weakening the hypotheses in their main theorem&lt;br/&gt;and studying a number of particular examples of partially hyperbolic systems.</AbstractNarration>
