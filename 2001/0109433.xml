    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0109433&lt;br/&gt;D. G. Cory, MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, based on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), is at the forefront of analysis of the structure and flow in porous material, with emphasis to geophysical exploration. The method will significantly improve the effectiveness of NMR to explore and characterize the structure and the dynamics of fluid transport through the porous material by coherent averaging. The NMR signature is separated in to an isotropic spectrum, a frequency modulation, and an amplitude modulation. These components can report on the chemistry of the mobile phase, the basic field variations, and the time/length scale correlation of the solid phase and the mobility of the mobile phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work for next year is focused on the design philosophy for the NMR coherent averaging scheme that suppress frequency modulations, extracting the model independent metrics from the amplitude modulation term, and finally to consider the inverse problem in these complex systems. This would be a significant development at the forefront of this technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is in collaboration between university/industry (MIT and Schlumberger) with a co-PI from each organization. The industrial partner is making substantial contribution to the project including the time of the co-PI from the industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project being at the forefront of NMR technology has broader impact in two fronts. First, the program involves training graduate students with a unique set of expertise. On a more general front, the method is applicable to many industrial and biological processes including exploration of material with insight that currently is not possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the proposed project is truly at the forefront of a major technology, and the scope is limited to the major innovative aspects of the overall research program, and the effective collaboration between the university and the industrial partner, the revised project is recommended for funding as a GOALI project.</AbstractNarration>
