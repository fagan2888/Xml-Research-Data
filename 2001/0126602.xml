    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project will develop a cost-effective commercial method for production of fully dense structural ceramic parts of complex shape directly by self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) reaction under pressure using the Electroconsolidation process. Many already developed high-performance ceramic materials are not used because of the high cost to fabricate components. The use of SHS to make parts offers considerable opportunity to reduce costs if dense, shaped parts can be made directly from reactant powder mix. Electroconsolidation is a newly developed process for low-cost pressure-assisted densification that is uniquely capable to meet this requirement. The project will determine the technical and economic feasibility of employing Electroconsolidation for making dense silicon carbide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial benefit if successful, would be products made from high-performance materials such as carbides, silicides, and carbo-nitrides could become more economical to&lt;br/&gt;produce.</AbstractNarration>
