    <AbstractNarration>The investigator will continue his research on analytic number &lt;br/&gt;theory, algebraic combinatorics, and the theory and application of&lt;br/&gt;multiple basic hypergeometric series. The investigator recently&lt;br/&gt;derived many infinite families of explicit exact formulas involving&lt;br/&gt;either squares or triangular numbers, two of which generalize&lt;br/&gt;Jacobi's (1829) 4 and 8 squares identities to 4n^2 or 4n(n+1)&lt;br/&gt;squares, respectively, without using cusp forms. He similarly&lt;br/&gt;generalized to infinite families all of Jacobi's explicitly stated &lt;br/&gt;degree 2, 4, 6, 8 Lambert series expansions of classical theta&lt;br/&gt;functions. These results, depending on new expansions for powers of&lt;br/&gt;various products of classical theta functions, arise in the setting of&lt;br/&gt;Jacobi elliptic functions, continued fractions, Hankel or Turanian&lt;br/&gt;determinants, Lie algebras, and Schur functions. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;first plans to finish his derivation of the infinite families of explicit&lt;br/&gt;exact sums of squares identities (excluding those above) for n^2 or&lt;br/&gt;n(n+1) squares, respectively, that he has already shown to exist. &lt;br/&gt;These will include explicit identities for an odd number of squares.&lt;br/&gt;Next, he plans to prove additional Kac--Wakimoto conjectures for&lt;br/&gt;triangular numbers. In the area of algebraic combinatorics, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator will develop the combinatorial and number theoretic&lt;br/&gt;implications of his new formulas for Ramanujan's tau function that&lt;br/&gt;are directly related to the Leech lattice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The above project utilizes explicit combinatorial and analytic &lt;br/&gt;methods to study the problem of representing an integer as a sum of&lt;br/&gt;squares of integers. This problem is one of the oldest and most&lt;br/&gt;significant in mathematics. It goes back at least 2000 years to&lt;br/&gt;Diophantus, and continues more recently with the works of Fermat,&lt;br/&gt;Euler, Lagrange, Jacobi, Glaisher, Ramanujan, Hardy, Mordell,&lt;br/&gt;Andrews, and others. Jacobi's elliptic function approach dates from&lt;br/&gt;his epic ``Fundamenta Nova'' of 1829. He found elegant simple&lt;br/&gt;formulas for counting the number of ways that any fixed positive&lt;br/&gt;integer n can be written as a sum of 2, 4, 6, or 8 squares. &lt;br/&gt;Applications of modular forms to sums of squares really started in&lt;br/&gt;1917 with Mordell. This approach provides abstract formulas for&lt;br/&gt;any given number of squares as the Fourier coefficients of modular&lt;br/&gt;forms. In 1965 Rankin proved that any one of these formulas, for&lt;br/&gt;more than 8 squares, would be highly non-trivial to compute&lt;br/&gt;explicitly. Since 1829, explicit exact non-trivial formulas have&lt;br/&gt;only been found for up to 32 squares, with an even number of&lt;br/&gt;squares much easier than an odd number. The investigator used his&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial/elliptic function methods to derive infinite families of&lt;br/&gt;expansions of powers of classical theta functions, and the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding non-trivial explicit sums of squares formulas. (See&lt;br/&gt;http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.NT/0008068). This is the first time&lt;br/&gt;that infinite families of non-trivial exact explicit formulas for&lt;br/&gt;sums of squares have been found. All of this work gives a new elegant&lt;br/&gt;extension of the classical formulas of Jacobi.</AbstractNarration>
