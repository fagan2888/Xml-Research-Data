    <AbstractNarration>This project is providing scholarships to allow students to pursue degrees in mathematics or engineering. The project is also designed to impact two year terminal and transfer computer science programs. The overall objective of the program is to provide a firm foundation in skills necessary for students to transfer from the community college to a four-year university and successfully complete a Bachelor's Degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four main goals :&lt;br/&gt;1) to recruit students to major in computer science, engineering, or mathematics (CSEM).&lt;br/&gt;2) to provide students the needed faculty and facilities support to major in a CSEM discipline.&lt;br/&gt;3) to use proven educational techniques in combination with effective use of instructional technology in a positive atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;4) to retain students as CSEM majors by providing tutoring, mentoring and peer support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on another NSF supported project "Improving Student Learning in PreCalculus and Calculus Through Effective Implementation of Technology." This project is enabling the college to install a mathematics computer lab which permits the math faculty to incorporate lab exercises into precalculus and calculus courses. The grant also provides funds for math faculty professional development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to recruit and retain students that have the academic ability but lack the financial means to attend a university as CSEM major. In particular this project is targeting financially needy students from small rural schools.</AbstractNarration>
