    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Drs. Kirk, Houde, Darnell, and DebBurman in the&lt;br/&gt;Biology Department at Lake Forest College to acquire a state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;multi-imaging system to further biological research and enhance the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate biology curriculum. Faculty in the biology department&lt;br/&gt;currently utilize molecular techniques to research basic aspects of biology&lt;br/&gt;such as chromosome replication, neural development and degeneration, and the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of sexual behavior. The multi-imaging system will allow the&lt;br/&gt;department to transition from conventional analyses of protein and DNA to a&lt;br/&gt;highly sensitive and quantitative approach utilizing fluorescent and&lt;br/&gt;radioactive signal detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Faculty-student collaborative research and teaching at Lake Forest College&lt;br/&gt;relies heavily on the use of modern molecular techniques in order to&lt;br/&gt;visualize a particular class of DNA or protein, separated from all other&lt;br/&gt;molecules of its kind. For example, Dr. Karen Kirk studies the interaction&lt;br/&gt;of specific proteins that bind to telomeres, the ends of chromosomes, in the&lt;br/&gt;cell cycle of the protozoan, Tetrahymena. Dr. Diana Darnell studies the&lt;br/&gt;expression of certain genes affecting neural development in chick, and Dr.&lt;br/&gt;Shubhik DebBurman studies the effects of protein-remodeling factors on human&lt;br/&gt;disease-associated proteins in yeast. Dr. Anne Houde will initiate a new&lt;br/&gt;molecular fingerprinting project in her ongoing studies of the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;sexual behavior and color polymorphism in guppies. The multi-imaging system&lt;br/&gt;is so versatile that it can be used in all these research contexts. Data&lt;br/&gt;will be collected much more efficiently and quantitatively from a variety of&lt;br/&gt;techniques, including agarose and acrylamide gel electrophoresis of nucleic&lt;br/&gt;acids and proteins, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), colony library&lt;br/&gt;screening, and Southern, Northern, and Western blotting. Acquisition of the&lt;br/&gt;multi-imaging system will allow more rapid processing of the data and hence&lt;br/&gt;greater throughput in laboratory procedures and will extend quantification&lt;br/&gt;capabilities to allow faculty and students to employ new experimental&lt;br/&gt;approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lake Forest College and its Biology Department are committed to an&lt;br/&gt;educational mission that stresses integration of research and teaching and&lt;br/&gt;provides an environment in which students can engage in original, publishable&lt;br/&gt;research. Students majoring in biology at Lake Forest College receive&lt;br/&gt;training in modern research methods through these research programs and&lt;br/&gt;through their course work. The undergraduate biology curriculum emphasizes&lt;br/&gt;student-designed investigation using current technology. This kind of&lt;br/&gt;environment in small colleges has been shown to contribute disproportionately&lt;br/&gt;to the pool of future research scientists. Lake Forest College has a strong&lt;br/&gt;track record in collaborative faculty-student research and will benefit&lt;br/&gt;substantially from the availability of a state-of-the-art multi-imaging&lt;br/&gt;system. Ultimately, the enhancement of the research and training capabilities&lt;br/&gt;of the biology department will help attract larger numbers of talented&lt;br/&gt;students interested in research and research careers. Currently, the&lt;br/&gt;majority of biology majors at Lake Forest College are women and a&lt;br/&gt;significant number are minority students. The college is strongly committed&lt;br/&gt;to recruitment of underrepresented groups and improved research facilities&lt;br/&gt;will help to achieve this goal.</AbstractNarration>
