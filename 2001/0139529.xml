    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a 3-year REU Site at Cornell University entitled, Protecting Water Quality: An REU Site for Research Experience of Undergraduates in Environmental and Biological Engineering, under the direction of Dr. Tammo S. Steenhuis. This 10-week summer program will provide 10 undergraduate students from Florida A&amp;M University, Clark Atlanta University, and the University of Puerto Rico with the opportunity to do research, with the assistance and guidance of a faculty mentor, on various aspects of biological and environmental engineering associated with protecting water quality. In addition, the students will attend weekly seminars, make weekly presentations on their work to their fellow REU students, and make a final technical presentation in a department wide setting.</AbstractNarration>
