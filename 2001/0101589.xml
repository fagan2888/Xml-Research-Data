    <AbstractNarration>This award is providing a series of hands-on professional and curriculum development workshops and follow-up activities for HS and TYC physics teachers who serve students involved in technology-based or technician careers. The workshops are focussed toward the effective integration and implementation of technology and the use of active learning strategies in areas such as microcomputer-based laboratories, digital video, computer simulations, conceptual tasks and tools, web and Internet activities, group work, assessment of learning, and physics-related technician education. Activities are linking participants to previous ATE projects and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of the workshops include:&lt;br/&gt;- an enhanced understanding and appreciation of the needs of the technician workforce;&lt;br/&gt;- educational programs that deal with technician, workforce issues;&lt;br/&gt;- the opportunity to identify and evaluate the appropriateness of the workshop ideas toward meeting the needs of these students and technician programs;&lt;br/&gt;- knowledge of and experience with recent advances and applications of computer technology, ATE supported centers and projects, assessment in student learning, and relevant curriculum materials and activities;&lt;br/&gt;- the background and incentive to develop, adapt, adopt, and implement workshop activities and materials into additional courses and programs; and&lt;br/&gt;- a method to build bridges and to develop working relationships between TYC and HS physics and technology programs, and local or regional businesses and industries.</AbstractNarration>
