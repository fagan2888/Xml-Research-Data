    <AbstractNarration>Geography (88)&lt;br/&gt;Increasing use of global positioning system (GPS) technology within agriculture, transportation, natural resource management, and other fields highlights the importance of understanding GPS principles as well as basic geographic concepts tied to location, direction, scale, and distance. This project is developing instructional modules that address theory, operation, and applications of GPS technology and its integration with other spatial technologies. Four modules are being designed for adaptation within undergraduate geography (or related) courses that emphasize basic navigation/positioning, spatial data capture, data management/ integration, or the analysis of geographic information. These modules contain three parts: 1) a web-based pre-lab exercise to be completed in advance of a class meeting, 2) presentation materials that can be used by instructors (topic outlines, photographs, diagrams, animations), and 3) hands-on exercises emphasizing field data capture and spatial data integration. These modules are undergoing a three tier evaluation. First, they are being critically examined by a curricula review team. Second, they are being tested within selected Oklahoma State University courses. Finally, they are being tested by faculty collaborators at six other campus sites. Nationwide dissemination of materials is being undertaken through the GPS Tools for Geographers web page. An important project goal is to update and revise project materials indefinitely and to attract a following that encourages contributions of new modules by faculty at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
