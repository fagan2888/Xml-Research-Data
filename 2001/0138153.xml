    <AbstractNarration>0138153&lt;br/&gt;Keniston &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports research experiences in India for graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The opportunity for students to conduct research is a new component of MIT's international program in India, which currently supports experiences in industry and teaching. Funding from NSF's Office of International Science &amp; Engineering will enable four MIT graduate students to do research at some of India's leading centers of research and higher education. The program is designed to integrate them into groundbreaking research at India's finest institutions, allow them to explore careers in research, and finally, to give them global experience early on in their education and training. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The PI is well connected with Indian institutions/researchers and has recently completed a term as visiting professor at the Nehru Centre for Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore. His collaborations with Indian colleagues at the IISc, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, and the National Centre for Biological Sciences have led to the development of opportunities for students in leading edge areas of telecommunications, information technology, genomics, and neurobiology. In addition to providing a unique research experience for MIT graduate students, it contributes to creating a globally-engaged workforce.</AbstractNarration>
