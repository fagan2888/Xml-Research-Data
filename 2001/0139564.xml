    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0139564&lt;br/&gt;Shirazi, Behrooz&lt;br/&gt;University of Texas at Arlington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU: Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Distributed Rational Agents&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) is one of the leading research-oriented institutions of higher education in Texas. The purpose of this proposal is to sustain a highly successful NSF REU site program in UTAs Computer Science and Engineering Department. Through this program, we intend to continue to provide opportunities for highly talented and qualified upper division women, minority, and disabled undergraduate students to participate in research programs in the field of distributed rational agents. The goal here is to augment the students' educational experience and to attract qualified undergraduates to graduate studies in computer science and engineering. The student participants will be recruited nationally, but due to the geographical location of UTA, one of our goals is to emphasize recruitment of students from women and minority institutions as well as institutions lacking research facilities in the southwest region. In the course of previous and current REU site projects we have already established contacts to a number of these schools and we intend to utilize these contacts in order to optimize our recruitment efforts.&lt;br/&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
