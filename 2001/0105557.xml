    <AbstractNarration>Frey&lt;br/&gt;EAR-0105557&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Terrestrial volcanoes are associated with three different tectonic&lt;br/&gt;settings. Two are associated with plate boundaries, that is, regions of&lt;br/&gt;plate divergence and convergence, and the third is intraplate volcanism.&lt;br/&gt;Magmas erupted in these different environments differ significantly in&lt;br/&gt;geochemical characteristics. In this proposed research the goal is to&lt;br/&gt;understand the source and processes which determine the geochemical&lt;br/&gt;characteristics of Hawaiian lavas. This endmember is of great interest&lt;br/&gt;because it may in part represent the consequences of subducting oceanic&lt;br/&gt;crust deep into the mantle at subduction zones.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach will be to determine abundances of major and trace elements&lt;br/&gt;and isotopic ratios of O, Sr, Nd, Pb, Hf and Os in lavas of varying&lt;br/&gt;relative age from these two shields. For Koolau the samples to be studied&lt;br/&gt;are from a recently drilled core, that penetrates the shield to a greater&lt;br/&gt;depth and older age than previously studied surficially exposed samples.&lt;br/&gt;For Kahoolawe, which has not been intensively studied, the samples will be&lt;br/&gt;from several stratigraphic sections across the shield. The principal&lt;br/&gt;objective is to understand the source components contributing to these&lt;br/&gt;magmas; hence emphasis will be on evaluating correlations between abundance&lt;br/&gt;ratios of highly incompatible elements, e.g., Ba/Th, Ce/Pb and La/Nb, and&lt;br/&gt;isotopic ratios. These geochemical characteristics will be determined&lt;br/&gt;using analytical facilities such as inductively couples plasma mass&lt;br/&gt;spectrometry and thermal ionization mass spectrometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of their oceanic plate setting, relatively simple mineralogy and a&lt;br/&gt;wealth complementary studies, Hawaiian volcanoes present the best&lt;br/&gt;opportunity for understanding the role of recycled crustal components in&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;oceanic island volcanism. In particular, this research will aid in&lt;br/&gt;constraining the processes and source components which create a geochemical&lt;br/&gt;endmember of Hawaiian shield lavas.</AbstractNarration>
