    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences: Symmetry and Mechanics: Geometric &lt;br/&gt;Integration&lt;br/&gt;Techniques and Bifurcations of Relative Critical Points&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0104292&lt;br/&gt;Lewis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project consists of three main components: geometric &lt;br/&gt;integration using Lie group methods, numerical &lt;br/&gt;integration of conservative systems, and bifurcation &lt;br/&gt;theory of relative critical points. The first component &lt;br/&gt;involves the design of efficient, stable geometric &lt;br/&gt;integration schemes on Lie groups and homogeneous &lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The primary goals are minimization of &lt;br/&gt;computational costs with accurate capture of key features &lt;br/&gt;and facilitation of the adaptation of existing numerical &lt;br/&gt;codes to geometric schemes. The second component &lt;br/&gt;addresses the role of approximate or exact preservation &lt;br/&gt;of conserved quantities or structures in the numerical &lt;br/&gt;integration of conservative systems. Comparisons of the &lt;br/&gt;symplectic, energy, and momentum errors to overall &lt;br/&gt;algorithm performance, including accuracy of capture of &lt;br/&gt;such key features of the underlying system as (relative) &lt;br/&gt;equilibria and separatrices, will be carried out for a &lt;br/&gt;variety of algorithms, including variational algorithms. &lt;br/&gt;The third component addresses the variational &lt;br/&gt;characterization of relative equilibria, that is, steady &lt;br/&gt;motions, as critical points of appropriate functionals. &lt;br/&gt;The notion of a relative critical point unifies and &lt;br/&gt;generalizes the two most widely used characterizations; &lt;br/&gt;this generalization will facilitate the extension of &lt;br/&gt;existing bifurcation and stability results to a wide &lt;br/&gt;range of finite and infinite dimensional systems and will &lt;br/&gt;provide insights into the geometric structure of sets of &lt;br/&gt;relative equilibria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specific applications of geometric integration methods &lt;br/&gt;include the Landau--Lifschitz--Ginzburg (LLG) equations &lt;br/&gt;for a micromagnetic field and various mathematical models &lt;br/&gt;of muscular hydrostats. The LLG equations model systems &lt;br/&gt;such as read/write heads on disk drives, nanocrystralline &lt;br/&gt;magnets, and magnetohydrodynamic materials; efficient, &lt;br/&gt;accurate numerical algorithms are needed to carry out &lt;br/&gt;simulations on the spatial and temporal scales relevant &lt;br/&gt;to industrial applications. Muscular hydrostats are &lt;br/&gt;structural components of many biological systems, &lt;br/&gt;including many kinds of worms, reptile and amphibian &lt;br/&gt;tongues, and sea anemones; plausible mathematical models &lt;br/&gt;of these systems are needed to test theories of the &lt;br/&gt;evolution of such systems. Conservative systems arise &lt;br/&gt;throughout physics and mechanics, playing a crucial role &lt;br/&gt;in both industrial and theoretical research. Numerical &lt;br/&gt;simulations that respect the conservation laws of such &lt;br/&gt;systems have been shown to be crucial in several fields, &lt;br/&gt;including astrophysics. The bifurcation analyses will be &lt;br/&gt;applied to problems in fluid mechanics, elasticity, and &lt;br/&gt;stellar dynamics.</AbstractNarration>
