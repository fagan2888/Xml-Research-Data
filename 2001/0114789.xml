    <AbstractNarration>This project will attempt to develop and extend a new framework for the modeling and compensation of reactive (inactive) power in electric power grids. Reactive power is essentially the result of difficulties in aligning the phases of electricity in AC power flows; in thc worst case, when a small power supply is connected to the grid with incorrect phase relations and timing, it may actua]ly take power away from the grid rather than add to the grid, even though it is burning fuel and generating electricity. Difficulties in managing such phase relatiotis are a major harrier to the greater, more efficient use of distributed generation and renewable energy sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By developing a new way to represent and manage such phase relations, ibis proposal hopes to provide a stream of benefits, both short-term and long-term, to the electric power community. The most immediate applications would be in power systems (for evaluation of loads and metering) industrial electric drives (for design of filters and control of converters) and power electronic systems (for modeling and control of active filters and uninterruptible power supplies.) Automotive, naval and aerospace applications are also envisioned.</AbstractNarration>
