    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for a conference entitled "Beneficial Use of Recycled Materials in Transportation Applications) to be held November 13-15, 2001 in Washington, DC. The primary sponsor of the conference is the Federal Highway Administration through the Recycled Materals Resource Center (RMRC) at UNH. The conference will focus on research and policy topics related to the use of different types of recycled materials (e.g. asphalt pavement, reclaimed concrete, tires, contaminated soils, coal ash, slags, foundry sands, municipal solid waste ash, construction and demolition aggregates, glass, shingles and compost) in the highway environment (e.g. pavements, embankments, flowable fills and appurtenances). The conference will bring together educators, students, researchers and practitioners interested in research and policy associated with recycled materials use in the transportation sector. &lt;br/&gt;A special issue of a research journal, or a book, will be published containing peer-reviewed papers from the conference. Another outcome will be a research needs white paper to be published with the conference papers. This white paper will also be distributed to interested Federal and state agencies. ***</AbstractNarration>
