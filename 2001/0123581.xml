    <AbstractNarration>This award is to continue the work of Bryn Mawr College in the promotion and support of the next generation of women in the mathematical sciences. The award supports the outreach, mentoring, and research projects of Professor Rhonda Hughes of the Department of Mathematics. This effort builds on previous efforts of the Principal Investigator and the College, aims to further identify and replicate effective structures that promote the successful advancement of women mathematical scientists, so that they might eventually assume positions of leadership in the science, engineering, and mathematics community. A significant portion of the work involves collaboration with Professor Sylvia Bozeman of Spelman College, as well as cooperation between Spelman and Bryn Mawr Colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activity involves four major components:(1)The EDGE Publication&lt;br/&gt;Program, which would provide for the broad dissemination of information about successful strategies for increasing the retention of women in graduate programs in mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;and supporting the advancement of their careers;(2)The Capacity Building Program for&lt;br/&gt;Women, which would establish a three-tiered mentoring program in order to increase the&lt;br/&gt;capacity of women to advance to positions of leadership in the academic community;(3)&lt;br/&gt;The EDGE Symposium 2003,which would provide a forum for identifying and disseminating information about institutional and individual paradigms that contribute to this&lt;br/&gt;advancement, and include an EDGE Reunion and mentoring workshops; and (4)The Re-&lt;br/&gt;search Program of the Principal Investigator, which would enable the Principal Investigator&lt;br/&gt;to intensify her research program in functional analysis and operator theory, and permit&lt;br/&gt;the increased involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in timely areas of mathematical research, with the long-range goal of their pursuing careers in the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the National Institutes of Health through the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
