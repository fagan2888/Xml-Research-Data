    <AbstractNarration>This project provides three years of partial core support of the Board on Mathematical Sciences (BMS) and full core support of its Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS), both groups being committees of the National Research Council. The BMS is the only prominent group in the United States wherein representatives from all the mathematical sciences---core mathematics, statistics, applied mathematics, operations research, and scientific computing---regularly meet to discuss ways to ensure and improve the intellectual vigor of the field. CATS is perhaps the premier assemblage of statistical researchers in the country, and it is similarly concerned with the intellectual vigor of its field. Both the BMS and CATS actively promote that vigor by organizing workshops and studies that focus attention on research opportunities that are ripe for exploration and, often, help to build links between the mathematical sciences and other fields of science, engineering, and medicine. To a lesser extent, they occasionally study policy issues that directly affect the health of the mathematical sciences. The requested core funding provides for two meetings each year of both CATS and BMS, an annual Department Chairs Colloquium, initiation of all projects, continuous oversight of all activities, and continuing cognizance of issues that need the attention of BMS and/or CATS.</AbstractNarration>
