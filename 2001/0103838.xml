    <AbstractNarration>Abstract of NSF Proposal #0103838&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Chi proposes to find smooth torsion-free G_3 connections that are not&lt;br/&gt;analytic by exploring a certain system of partial differential equations &lt;br/&gt;induced from such connections. The affirmative solution to this work will&lt;br/&gt;open a new avenue of research about these connections, for which all the &lt;br/&gt;known examples by far have been analytic. He also proposes to investigate&lt;br/&gt;the classification problem of isoparametric hypersurfaces with four&lt;br/&gt;principal curvatures in spheres by investigating the normal holonomy Lie &lt;br/&gt;algebra of a focal submanifold of the hypersurface, which contains the&lt;br/&gt;information about the 2nd fundamental form of the focal submanifold, which&lt;br/&gt;is, by his study, crucial for the classification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If one sets off from the North Pole and travels with a compass along a &lt;br/&gt;loop, one will discover that at the end of the trip back at the North Pole&lt;br/&gt;the compass needle has turned a degree. This says mathematically that parallel&lt;br/&gt;translation (induced by a linear connection) of vectors along loops can&lt;br/&gt;detect whether the space is flat, which is fundamental to Einstein's &lt;br/&gt;Theory of Relativity. In Hermann Weyl's terms, the existence of inertia &lt;br/&gt;systems in the universe warrants that its linear connection is&lt;br/&gt;torsion-free. The project on torsion-free G_3 connections is a study of the &lt;br/&gt;rather anomalous nature of these connections among all exotic holonomies &lt;br/&gt;whose development has been participated by the PI. The notion of&lt;br/&gt;isoparametric hypersurfaces was first proposed in connection with wave &lt;br/&gt;fronts in Euclidean space and recently the more general Dupin hypersurfaces &lt;br/&gt;were tied with integrable hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type. Shortly &lt;br/&gt;after their introduction the isoparametric hypersurfaces were all classified &lt;br/&gt;in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces of all dimensions. The complete &lt;br/&gt;classification of such hypersurfaces in spheres of arbitrary dimensions has &lt;br/&gt;defied people's efforts for nearly six decades, despite many outstanding&lt;br/&gt;results achieved in the past three decades. The PI's second project is to &lt;br/&gt;utilize the normal holonomy and the new approach of him, T. Cecil and G. &lt;br/&gt;Jensen toward the classification in the case of four principal &lt;br/&gt;curvatures.</AbstractNarration>
