    <AbstractNarration>The major goal of the Twelfth Conversation in Stereodynamics, to be held June 19-23, 2001 is to discuss developing ideas nd discoveries in the broad context of biological sructure, dynamics, interactions and expression. About 500 scientist are expected to come together from many nations to share ideas about these topics. The conference will cover about 65 lectures, and 250 posters, with both formal and informal discussions. The focus will be on the ribosome, structure and dynamics, structural genomics and DNA based nanotechnology, among other subjects. The new information that will be discussed at this meeting is relevant to a number of emerging technologies, those that are breaking through with immense implications to the future of science and society. This conference is unique in that it focusses on such emerging areas and technologies.</AbstractNarration>
