    <AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Patricia Crown, MS Elizabeth Bagwell will collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will direct a crew of experienced volunteers in intensive architectural recording at four cliff-dwellings located in the Sierra Madre Occidental along the border between the states of Sonora and Chihuahua, Mexico. These five to twenty room adobe buildings are believed to be contemporaneous with the regional center of Casas Grandes (or Paquime) 40 km to the east, which dates to ca. A.D. 1100-1475. MS Bagwell will examine these sites to determine how the production of architecture was organized among prehistoric societies in Northern Mexico. While full-time building specialists were probably necessary to build the pyramids and palaces common in more complex societies like the Aztecs, archaeologists know very little about the role of specialists in the every-day construction of the homes of the common people. &lt;br/&gt; A technological analysis of architecture is one way to determine if specialists helped produce these buildings. Buildings built by specialists should be more uniform than those built by non-specialists. Raw material composition, manufacturing techniques and planned construction of more than one structure at a time has been associated with architectural specialists. Therefore this work will compare these attributes and their production through time. One way of gaining a fine-grained understanding of architectural production through time is with tree-ring dating, a technique that uses the pattern of thick and thin growth rings in a tree, much like a bar code, to determine the year that the tree died and by association the year that the structure was built. Temporal information resulting from tree-rings will be combined with technological data to create construction histories and settlement growth patterns. Ultimately, if uniform attributes are identified, they will be interpreted as evidence of prehistoric architectural specialists. &lt;br/&gt; MS Bagwell's research will contribute to the understanding of the way architectural production was organized in non-state societies. It will also expand our knowledge of a poorly understood Northern Mexico and establish the relationship between these sites and other contemporary groups such as the Hohokam, Casas Grandes, Rio Sonora and Animas. Finally, this research will move one step closer to establishing a badly needed chronology for the region.</AbstractNarration>
