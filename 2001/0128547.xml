    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a new surface modification technique for manufacturing copper indium diselenide (CIS) thin films, an important emerging photovoltaic technology. It will eliminate present toxic processing steps involving cadmium sulfide deposition, cyanide etch, all of which have many unfavorable repercussions to the manufacturer and the environment. The key step will be to devise a simple, inexpensive process, using air and a non-toxic aqueous solution, to alter the surface properties of CIS films. This step will eliminate the need for the cadmium component, the cyanide etch and the disposal of hazardous chemicals. It will also improve the efficiency of solar cells made with inexpensive coating methods. Performance evaluation of the modified CIS solar cells will validate the new concept. This innovation is anticipated to simplify manufacturing, lower costs and improve the efficiency of photovoltaic modules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for the CIS photovoltaic technology range from powering small appliances to electric utility. Non-utility applications include solar cars, building integration, mobile systems and space systems. Lower costs, fewer components and easier manufacturing could translate into a wider spectrum of commercial markets for CIS solar cells. Eliminating the toxicity issues will enhance the public perception of CIS photovoltaic technology. Its implementation will promote the market success of CIS solar cells to provide a timely solution to the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems.</AbstractNarration>
