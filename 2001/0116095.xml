    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Angelo State University will be able to acquire research instruments required to establish an advanced, modern facility capable of supporting professional research activity for faculty collaborators and essential research training for undergraduate students. The facility will enable the study of material properties under the variations of temperature, optical excitation, and magnetic and electric fields. Students, along with faculty mentors, will perform advanced electrical and optical measurements, such as photoluminescence spectroscopy, photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, optical absorption, Raman scattering spectroscopy, photoconductivity, and Hall-effect measurements in the examination of standard and novel semiconductor materials and heterostructures and novel superconductor materials. The new instrumentation will establish a new realm of possibilities for advanced research, offering undergraduate students appropriately challenging, exciting and educational research training while conducting relevant and interesting scientific investigations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program, Angelo State University will acquire research instruments required to establish an advanced, modern facility capable of supporting professional research activity for faculty collaborators and essential research training for undergraduate students. The facility, aimed at the study of material properties, will support opportunities for faculty-sponsored undergraduate research projects, fulfilling an integral part of the university mission of integrating meaningful advanced research into the educational experience of physics, applied physics, and pre-engineering majors. The new instrumentation will establish a new realm of possibilities for advanced research, offering undergraduate students appropriately challenging, exciting and educational research training while conducting relevant and interesting scientific investigations.</AbstractNarration>
