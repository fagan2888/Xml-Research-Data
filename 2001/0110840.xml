    <AbstractNarration>0110840&lt;br/&gt;Peck&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment grant provides partial support to enhance an environmental magnetics laboratory at the University of Akron, Ohio. The existing environmental magnetics laboratory contains a Molspin spinner magnetometer, ASC Impulse magnetizer and Bartington susceptibility equipment. This proposal and cost sharing from the University of Akron will be used to establish a fully-functional laboratory through the acquisition of a D-Tech Model D-2000 AF demagnetizer, 2.5 m3 fluxgate-controlled field-free cage, Micromag alternating gradient magnetometer, and additional Bartington susceptibility sensors. The addition of this equipment will allow the full suite of environmental magnetic parameters of wet sediment to be measured. The rock-magnetic component of environmental magnetism involves the measurement of the concentration, grain-size, and mineralogy of the magnetic portion of the sediment and is used to interpret past environmental change. The paleomagnetic component of environmental magnetism involves the study of the natural remanent magnetization of the sediment and provides a means of global stratigraphic correlation, dating, and insight on geodynamo processes. Current NSF-funded projects in Mongolia, Africa, Russia and Turkey will make effective use of this equipment. Ongoing NSF research projects directed by PI, John Peck involve the study of past environmental change as recorded in the sediments of Mongolian lakes, Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana and Lake Baikal, Russia. Drs. Lisa Park, Ira Sasosky and Tim Matney from the University of Akron will use this equipment in their research of paleolimnology in Africa, archaeology in Turkey and clastic cave deposits in the U.S., respectively. Researchers and students from nearby Universities will have free-access to this new equipment thereby allowing them to readily utilize this equipment in their research. Geologists at nearby Kent State University, Case Western Reserve University and Oberlin College have all expressed their interest in using this equipment that is new to the region. In addition, the new equipment will serve educational goals and be used extensively in a new Geology course titled Environmental Magnetism taught by PI, Peck.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
