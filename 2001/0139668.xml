    <AbstractNarration>The University of Kansas offers a 10-week summer program of Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Molecular Biosciences. Complete details of the scientific and social aspects of the Molecular Biosciences summer program including an on-line application are available at http://rnaworld.bio.ku.edu/reu/ .&lt;br/&gt;Because independent research is pivotal in a student's commitment to a career in biological research, we encourage applications from students at colleges with limited research opportunities, and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in this field. Our program has several objectives: to attract students to careers in science by allowing them to contribute meaningfully to on-going laboratory research of national importance; to ensure that students who are already interested in research, or are just starting, receive the encouragement they need to continue; and to facilitate this by providing faculty mentoring as well as peer mentoring from undergraduates already involved in research. Participants gain the direct experience they need to make an informed career decision and, if they so choose, to succeed in graduate school. University of Kansas undergraduates currently engaged in research serve as peer mentors and role models for the summer students, helping them to become more quickly acquainted with the University and making them feel more at ease in their labs. &lt;br/&gt;Our research focuses on several overlapping areas of biochemistry; molecular, cellular, and developmental biology; microbiology; and neurobiology. Major strengths are in the areas of protein structure and function, enzyme mechanisms and protein engineering; proteins involved in cytoskeletal structure; the structure, function and regulation of membrane proteins - receptors, ion channels and ion transporters - and of their genes; and molecular analysis of signal transduction and gene regulation in microbial metabolism, virus infection, learning and memory, and eukaryotic developmental biology. Projects have been chosen so that a student can logically build upon previous laboratory and course experience in the natural sciences. During the course of the summer, students gradually gain more independence and control over their research. &lt;br/&gt;Participants will engage in a variety of enrichment activities. At weekly lunch meetings, participants give 20-minute presentations describing their project - background, plans, and current status. A second weekly series targets career development and career choices in the area of molecular biosciences, including careers in academic, industrial, or medical research, as well as the nature of science and its professional ethics</AbstractNarration>
