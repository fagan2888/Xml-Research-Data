    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Engineering Technology (58) &lt;br/&gt;This project is developing an interdisciplinary, team-taught block of courses to train engineering technology students in industrial-level process control equipment and associated systems integration. These courses are also instilling advanced communication skills necessary for quality performance in a technical and professional environment. Target Audience/Diversity consists of students coming from five counties designated by Congress as part of Appalachia, i.e. a population underrepresented among the college-going population. This population is largely comprised of first generation college students of whom about 20% are returning adult students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is addressing the following problems:&lt;br/&gt;a. Curriculum provides inadequate training on realistic industrial-level equipment due to&lt;br/&gt;design limitations, dated technology, and the large learning curve.&lt;br/&gt;b. Inadequate communication skills limit students in understanding, recording, and&lt;br/&gt;referencing the hierarchical concepts needed to negotiate the equipment complexities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addressing these problems, a three-member faculty team (two engineering professors/one English professor) will adapt an interdisciplinary approach implemented by three institutions (Drexel University, Texas A&amp;M University, and Arizona State University, all members of a NSF-funded coalition) to improve engineering education. The modified approach integrates four required and one optional course in engineering technology and English into a three-semester sequence, with courses collaboratively taught.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives\outcomes of the project consist of:&lt;br/&gt;a. Training engineering technology students in industrial-level equipment and systems&lt;br/&gt;integration.&lt;br/&gt;b. Using technical writing training to improve learning on technical equipment.&lt;br/&gt;c. Cross-training faculty on the pedagogical models.&lt;br/&gt;d. Disseminating resulting course plans and laboratory design materials via professional&lt;br/&gt;journals, workshops\website, and conferences.&lt;br/&gt;e. Providing an exemplary approach for writing-intensive courses in other disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
