    <AbstractNarration>Pires&lt;br/&gt;0110832&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Metamorphosis is a profoundly important transition in the life history of most animals. The passage from a larval to juvenile form entails destruction of some tissues, respecification of others and generation of new structures. In larvae of gastropod molluscs and in a diverse range of larvae from other phyla, metamorphosis is initiated by a chemical signal from the environment. The chemosensory induction of gastropod metamorphosis, its stereotyped behavioral context and the neuromuscular nature of some morphogenic movements, and the rapidity of morphological change all suggest pervasive control by the larval nervous system. However, very little is known of the mechanisms by which the nervous system can direct dramatic morphological change at the level of the entire organism. Dr. Pires will investigate the neural control of metamorphosis in the gastropod, Crepidula fornicata, focusing on neural signaling in the destruction of the larval velum. This ciliated swimming and feeding organ is precipitously shed by loss of adhesion among and between several types of velar cells within minutes after competent larvae come in contact with the natural cue that induces metamorphosis. The large ciliated cells that line the margin of the velum are the first to detach in metamorphosis, are electrically excitable, and have been shown in other gastropods to carry a synaptically-driven calcium-mediated action potential that causes arrest of ciliary beating. These cilia are arrested in C. fornicata and other gastropods in the moments before destruction of the velum visibly begins, yet no studies have investigated the mechanistic relationship between electrical activity in the velum and the loss of cell adhesion that occurs in metamorphosis. Previous work by Dr. Pires and others has implicated endogenous dopamine as a neuromodulator that potentiates metamorphosis, but its effects on signaling in the velum are unexplored. There is also evidence that hydrogen peroxide or other reactive oxygen species are generated in the metamophosing velum and can induce velar destruction if exogenously applied, but it is not known if reactive oxygen species have a necessary signaling role in a neural mechanism that mediates velar destruction in natural metamorphosis.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Pires will exploit the large size and predictably fast metamorphosis of C. fornicata larvae, and take advantage of microsurgical methods that he developed for working with isolated velar tissues. Dr. Pires and his students will apply intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological techniques as well as pharmacological, histochemical and high-performance liquid chromatographic methods to analyze how neural signals effect a rapid loss of cell adhesion in the metamorphosing velum. This project affords undergraduate research students an unusual opportunity to engage in developmental neuroscience that cuts across several levels of biological organization. An important further training dimension of this project is that summer work will take place at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Laboratories, where undergraduates will be immersed in a rich and exhilarating scientific community at a time when they will be making decisions about future research careers.</AbstractNarration>
