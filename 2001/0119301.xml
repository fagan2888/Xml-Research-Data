    <AbstractNarration>The power industry must undertake a managed redesign of the Nation's power system so that it can adapt to deregulation and to rapid changes in the power requirements and regional economic conditions. The need for research in this area is vividly illustrated by the recent California power problems. This second five year continuing grant funds the University of California, Berkeley as part of a multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Power Systems Engineering (PSERC). The I/UCRC involves 10 university research sites generating over $1.5 million. The four universities, Cornell University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the University of Illinois-Champaign, and the University of California-Berkeley, being addressed in identical proposals as a group have generated over $600,000 in the last year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center addresses research projects in marketing, transmission and distribution and systems in electric power generation and transmission.</AbstractNarration>
