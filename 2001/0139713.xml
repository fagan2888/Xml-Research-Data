    <AbstractNarration>The Investigator and his colleagues will study a number of &lt;br/&gt;problems in complex algebraic geometry. First, they will &lt;br/&gt;explore some new asymptotic invariants of linear series on &lt;br/&gt;a projective variety, especially their variational behavior. &lt;br/&gt;While the geometry of linear series is a very classical topic, &lt;br/&gt;new methods have the potential to shed light on basic properties &lt;br/&gt;that have not up to now received much attention. A second &lt;br/&gt;project involves the exploration of some new invariants arising &lt;br/&gt;from multiplier ideals: these jumping numbers generalize the &lt;br/&gt;much-studied log-canonical threshold of a divisor or ideal, and &lt;br/&gt;they seem to encode quite interesting geometric and algebraic &lt;br/&gt;information. Lazarsfeld also intends to use multiplier ideals &lt;br/&gt;to study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of reduced projective &lt;br/&gt;varieties defined by equations of given degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic focus of this project (so-called "linear series on &lt;br/&gt;algebraic varieties") can be viewed as families of functions &lt;br/&gt;constrained by geometric spaces. When the spaces have low &lt;br/&gt;dimension such linear series have been used to find efficient &lt;br/&gt;ways to encode data, for example on CD's. The Investigator and &lt;br/&gt;his colleagues will study the new phenomena that arise when the &lt;br/&gt;geometric spaces have higher dimension.</AbstractNarration>
