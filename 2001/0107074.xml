    <AbstractNarration>The Chanka Archaeology Project under the direction of Dr. Brian Bauer is dedicated to documenting and interpreting the development of &lt;br/&gt;complex societies in the Andahuaylas region of the Peruvian Andes from AD 500 &lt;br/&gt;to AD 1532. The Chanka who once lived in the region are of special interest &lt;br/&gt;to archaeologists and historians since they once rivaled and fought against &lt;br/&gt;the Inca State for control of the central Andes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic of early state development is a major theoretical issue of current &lt;br/&gt;anthropological research. The Chanka have been excluded from these discussions &lt;br/&gt;since very little original archeological research has been conducted in their &lt;br/&gt;core region. What theories have been presented concerning the development of &lt;br/&gt;the Chanka are largely derived from readings of the Spanish chronicles. Until &lt;br/&gt;these models are tested against archaeological data they will remain &lt;br/&gt;hypothetical and untested and the study of the pre-Hispanic social &lt;br/&gt;organization of the Chanka can not advance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project, which will run for three field seasons, includes a systematic &lt;br/&gt;archaeological survey of the Chanka heartland and an extensive review of &lt;br/&gt;archival materials located in Peru and Spain. The survey will cover an area &lt;br/&gt;of approximately 200 square kilometers and provide a comprehensive data base &lt;br/&gt;on the location, size and age of archaeological sites in the Andahuaylas &lt;br/&gt;Valley. The results of the survey will be used to address a series of &lt;br/&gt;questions concerning the development of complex societies in the region. For &lt;br/&gt;example: What effect did the conquest of the region by the Wari Empire (AD &lt;br/&gt;550-1000) have on the indigenous populations?, Is there evidence of early &lt;br/&gt;state development in the valley during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000 - &lt;br/&gt;1400)? and, What was the social organization of the Andahuaylas area during &lt;br/&gt;the period of Inca rule?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The archival research will take place in Cuzco, Andahuaylas, and Lima (Peru) &lt;br/&gt;as well as in Seville (Spain). The historical research will support, &lt;br/&gt;complement, and extend the archaeological field work by providing concise data &lt;br/&gt;on specific sites and by procuring additional information on the land &lt;br/&gt;holdings, populations, and social organization of Chanka kin groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In sum, the Chanka Archaeological Project will provide a regional context to &lt;br/&gt;study the development of the Chanka and it will enable scholars to address &lt;br/&gt;questions concerning the development of Chanka society before and after Inca &lt;br/&gt;expansionism. The project will also enable researchers to make comparisons &lt;br/&gt;between the development of the Chanka and that of other important groups, both &lt;br/&gt;in the Andes and elsewhere in the ancient New World.</AbstractNarration>
