    <AbstractNarration>NetFS is a file system interface to the network configuration parameters of an operating system. All network configuration is performed by file operations, thus inheriting file system protection, including limited user and group access, as well as support for hierarchies, which more readily support virtual networks. This results in fine-grained resource protection for individual network settings, providing in a safe environment in which applications can have controlled access to limited subsets of network configuration and control, such as routing tables, interface configurations, IP security associations, and firewall rules. NetFS also provides an interface that unifies access to these networking parameters of the operating system under a portable file system paradigm. This unified controlled interface also more readily supports advanced virtual networking, where individual applications are attached to different subsets of network infrastructure to support concurrent participation in multiple coalitions.</AbstractNarration>
