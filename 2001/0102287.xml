    <AbstractNarration>With support of this planning grant, Russell Donnelly, Professor of Physics and Director of the Cryogenic Helium Turbulence Laboratory at the University of Oregon, Eugene, is developing a four-part television series on low-temperature physics. Based on Tom Shachtman's 1999 book of the same title, the series will explore the field's key concepts, the significant individuals and events in its history, its impact on society through such technologies as air conditioning, refrigeration and liquefied gases, and its promise for the future. Shachtman will be the principal writer for the project, and Donnelly and Shachtman will work closely with television producers Meredith Burch and Steve Lyons, formerly a producer for NOVA. Barbara Flagg will conduct front-end evaluation during the planning phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Activities to be conducted during the planning phase include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary evaluation of audience knowledge&lt;br/&gt;Consultations and meetings with advisors&lt;br/&gt;Development of detailed content outlines for the four programs&lt;br/&gt;Exploration of means to enhance the impact of the project through ancillary materials and outreach &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment will include an investigation of the potential for adapting the content to other media such as design of a traveling exhibit, development of a Spanish-language radio version, production of "mini-films' for use on children's cable television, and publication of specialized print media.</AbstractNarration>
