    <AbstractNarration>The gap between processor speed and main memory access speed&lt;br/&gt;can cause processors to spend much of their time waiting on memory accesses.&lt;br/&gt;As the gap has grown, this memory latency has become an&lt;br/&gt;increasingly significant bottleneck in processor performance.&lt;br/&gt;Existing cache designs have worked well to fill the gap,&lt;br/&gt;but new cache designs are needed as the gap continues to grow.&lt;br/&gt;A promising new class, restricted caches, includes&lt;br/&gt;skew caches, assist caches, victim caches, and other multi-lateral caches.&lt;br/&gt;Experiments have indicated that some restricted caches&lt;br/&gt;offer significant potential for improvement over traditional&lt;br/&gt;set-associative caches. They also have revealed some interesting&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon that are not possible in traditional caches. For example,&lt;br/&gt;skew caches seem to exhibit self-reorganization.&lt;br/&gt;However, no theoretical explanation exists for this behavior or for&lt;br/&gt;why these restricted caches perform well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators study the performance of distinct restricted cache&lt;br/&gt;structures and algorithms for managing them.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators first identify an underlying structural difference&lt;br/&gt;between restricted caches and traditional fully-associative&lt;br/&gt;caches: all cache lines are not identical. Specifically, in a&lt;br/&gt;restricted cache, unlike in a traditional set-associative cache,&lt;br/&gt;there exist pairs of memory blocks whose sets of legal cache lines&lt;br/&gt;are not identical and have a non-empty intersection.&lt;br/&gt;Using this insight, the investigators evaluate and&lt;br/&gt;compare different cache structures using new techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Most other analytical studies of caches focus only on the performance&lt;br/&gt;of algorithms for a given cache structure and do not explicitly&lt;br/&gt;compare the effectiveness of distinct cache structures. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators also study the performance of various algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for these cache structures using a variety of techniques such&lt;br/&gt;as resource augmentation, standard competitive analysis,&lt;br/&gt;and trace-based simulation. Their results indicate that traditional&lt;br/&gt;cache management algorithms behave very differently on restricted&lt;br/&gt;caches than they do on traditional set-associative caches.&lt;br/&gt;For example, the least recently used (LRU) algorithm that is strongly&lt;br/&gt;competitive for traditional caches is not competitive at all for&lt;br/&gt;restricted caches unless explicit rearrangement of items in the&lt;br/&gt;cache is allowed. Finally, the investigators construct a&lt;br/&gt;trace warehouse to facilitate the comparison of distinct trace-based&lt;br/&gt;simulation studies as well as to help new researchers learn this&lt;br/&gt;this evaluation technique.</AbstractNarration>
