    <AbstractNarration>Focused Research Collaboration Proposal: Differential Algebraic&lt;br/&gt;Inequalities and their Applications to Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This focused research project proposes a comprehensive investigation&lt;br/&gt;of Differential Algebraic Inequalities (DAIs) and Dynamic&lt;br/&gt;Complementarity Problems (DCPs), with the goal of developing an&lt;br/&gt;extensive theory, designing and analyzing efficient algorithms, and&lt;br/&gt;applying the results to problems in engineering of practical&lt;br/&gt;importance. The two problem classes of DAIs and DCPs represent a&lt;br/&gt;significant extension of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) and a&lt;br/&gt;differential algebraic equation (DAE). The proposed study necessitates&lt;br/&gt;the use of state of the art mathematical programming methods in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with ODE and DAE methods to deal effectively with the&lt;br/&gt;inequalities and complementarity conditions in a DAI/DCP. The latter&lt;br/&gt;are novel features that are absent in ODEs or DAEs. Since the main&lt;br/&gt;methods for solving DCPs and DAIs in realistic situations are&lt;br/&gt;numerical, the research will emphasize the interactions among&lt;br/&gt;formulation, computation, and mathematical issues such as convergence&lt;br/&gt;and approximation including numerical approximation and sensitivity to&lt;br/&gt;parametric perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DAIs and DCPs provide a powerful mathematical framework for the&lt;br/&gt;comprehensive treatment of a host of important complex system&lt;br/&gt;applications that have so far received only minimal attention from&lt;br/&gt;applied and computational mathematicians. The project will open a new&lt;br/&gt;chapter in applied mathematics in which classical differential&lt;br/&gt;equation theory is merged with contemporary mathematical programming&lt;br/&gt;methods. The deliverables of the project will a set of broadly&lt;br/&gt;applicable mathematical and computational tools that will have a&lt;br/&gt;direct impact in several distinct engineering disciplines including:&lt;br/&gt;constrained mechanical systems with frictional contact arising in&lt;br/&gt;robotics and manufacturing, conditional modeling in chemical and&lt;br/&gt;hydraulic processes, and hybrid systems with variable-structure&lt;br/&gt;control encountered in avionics, intelligent highway systems, and&lt;br/&gt;automotive systems.</AbstractNarration>
