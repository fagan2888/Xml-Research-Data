    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Karen A. High&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oklahoma State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0100899&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Inaugural Woman's Initiative Committee Session entitled "turn of the Century Chemical Engineers: Successes and Challenges" will be held at the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) meeting in Los Angeles. It will be a full morning session from 8:30 to 11:30 am with seven speakers including women from industry, academia government. Some of the presentations include:&lt;br/&gt;- A discussion of the work of the Congressional Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technology Development by Dr. Kathryn Johnson, Vice President of Matrix Consulting Group&lt;br/&gt;- A discussion of the progress made by women chemical engineers and opportunities for partnership between AIChE and the Women in Engineering Programs Advocacy Network (WEPAN) by Dr. Suzanne Brainard, Director of the Center for Women in Science and Engineering at the University of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The session is a part of a more comprehensive program to help women at all stages of their careers - from graduate student to tenured faculty as well as women in various industrial positions in the chemical process industries - to advance in their careers. Other activities will continue during the day including the inauguration of a joint venture with the Girl Scouts to develop science kits which will hopefully help encourage young girls to study engineering.</AbstractNarration>
