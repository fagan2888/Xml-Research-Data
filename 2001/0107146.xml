    <AbstractNarration>Two major well-recognized difficulties in numerical simulation of waves&lt;br/&gt;propagating over unbounded domains are the accumulation of error during &lt;br/&gt;long time intervals and necessity to truncate the domain and subsequently &lt;br/&gt;set the artificial boundary conditions (ABCs) at the external artificial&lt;br/&gt;boundary. These two issues turn out to be closely related. In the previous&lt;br/&gt;work of the PI with collaborators that has been done in the framework of&lt;br/&gt;the scalar wave equation, we have used the inherently three-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;phenomenon of lacunae and developed a methodology that modifies any &lt;br/&gt;appropriate discrete scheme so that the long-term error buildup is fully &lt;br/&gt;eliminated while all of the original properties of the scheme (e.g., order &lt;br/&gt;of accuracy) are preserved. Moreover, the procedure allows one to replace &lt;br/&gt;the original infinite domain by a finite computational domain, which leads &lt;br/&gt;to obtaining highly accurate non-local unsteady ABCs. These ABCs are built &lt;br/&gt;directly for the discrete formulation of the problem, their temporal non-&lt;br/&gt;locality is fixed and limited, and they possess full geometric universality. &lt;br/&gt;The key objective of the proposed project is to extend the aforementioned &lt;br/&gt;methodology to wave-type models of practical interest, in particular, the &lt;br/&gt;Maxwell's equations (electromagnetic waves) and the linearized Euler's and &lt;br/&gt;full-potential equations (acoustic waves). The attainability of this goal &lt;br/&gt;is accounted for by the fact that the solutions to these equations have &lt;br/&gt;sharp aft fronts of the waves (manifestation of lacunae), which is the &lt;br/&gt;exact same behavior as displayed by the solutions to the wave equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerical simulation of waves on unbounded domains has numerous applications &lt;br/&gt;that range from scattering of electromagnetic waves from aircraft and ground &lt;br/&gt;vehicles (radar technology) to antenna design to calculation of the acoustic&lt;br/&gt;fields produced by the airframe and airplane's jet engines for the purpose of &lt;br/&gt;reducing the noise levels around airports, as well as inside the passenger &lt;br/&gt;compartments. The results that we expect to obtain are going to benefit the &lt;br/&gt;foregoing applied areas. Indeed, we anticipate the creation of a universal &lt;br/&gt;framework that would allow one to modify a wide class of already existing and &lt;br/&gt;proven methods so that to enable two additional crucial capabilities -- long-&lt;br/&gt;term integration and accurate computation of infinite-domain wave fields on &lt;br/&gt;truncated domains. Besides, as the proposed research unfolds, it will &lt;br/&gt;necessarily include communication and collaboration with physicists and &lt;br/&gt;engineers, as well as preparation of course materials and training young &lt;br/&gt;researchers.</AbstractNarration>
