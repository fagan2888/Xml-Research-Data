    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0111159&lt;br/&gt;Zakin, Jacques, Ohio State University (PI); Baird, Donald, Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Co-PI)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an international group travel grant for US academic researchers invited to the Second Eastern Chemical Engineering Conference for Collaborative Research to be held in Ankara, Turkey, May 20-25, 2001. The conference participants are from the eastern Mediterranean countries of Turkey, Greece, Israel, Jordan, and also include participants from the United States. Collaborative research between Turkey, Greece, Israel, Jordan, and the United States will be very much encouraged as the key by-product of this conference. Chemical engineering research sub-disciplines to be covered at the meeting include: catalysis, advanced materials, separations, systems engineering, and biotechnology. NSF funding will be used for travel costs for about twenty Unites States chemical engineering faculty including partial support for five prominent U. S. researchers to serve as discussion leaders in their respective areas of chemical engineering. The USA participation plan for the Conference is designed to help assure the participation of young faculty and graduate students through an approximate 50% target for this group. Five, sub-discipline reports summarizing the activities and accomplishments of the meeting in each of the five areas will be provided to NSF after the meeting as part of the final report. The Turkish organizers will pay for local arrangements as well as pay for the travel of seven additional U. S. researchers in areas and for individuals they particularly want to attend.&lt;br/&gt;The U. S. will benefit from this program by virtue of the productive relationships that are expected to emerge leading to the transfer of expertise.</AbstractNarration>
