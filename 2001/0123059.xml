    <AbstractNarration>A number of opportunities exist for COLLEGE OF MENOMINEE NATION that require further &lt;br/&gt;development of SMET programs currently offered at the College. To forward its 8,000 &lt;br/&gt;years of stewardship and expertise in sustainable forest management, the Menominee&lt;br/&gt;Nation is committed to ensuring that future generations are prepared as stewards &lt;br/&gt;well-schooled in sound sciences and best practices in Menominee autochthony. Our&lt;br/&gt;challenge is to assure that quality in SMET education is commensurate with that &lt;br/&gt;stewardship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLEGE OF MENOMINEE NATION will enhance student opportunities in science, math,&lt;br/&gt;engineering and technology through a planning process that will provide assessment &lt;br/&gt;of the SMET infrastructure and the development of an institutional plan to enhance its&lt;br/&gt;SMET program. The process will also assess the needs of the communities on the &lt;br/&gt;Menominee Reservation, as well as the Oneida, Mohican and Potowatomi Nations and &lt;br/&gt;neighboring non-Indian communities to determine the constellation of SMET programs&lt;br/&gt;that will promote sustainable development in the communities of northeastern &lt;br/&gt;Wisconsin. In addition, assessment of the current math offerings as a necessary&lt;br/&gt;interface is a priority. We envision such an analysis as the key to our delivery &lt;br/&gt;of student research opportunities in eco-toxicology, environmental science and &lt;br/&gt;environmental health.</AbstractNarration>
