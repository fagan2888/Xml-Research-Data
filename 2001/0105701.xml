    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to establish methods for theoretical &lt;br/&gt;study in an important area of theoretical computer science, which is&lt;br/&gt;the analysis of randomized algorithms. The main focus is on problems&lt;br/&gt;that either can be modeled by Markov chains or can be analyzed using&lt;br/&gt;the Markov chain approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concentrates on three main topics: (1) general analysis&lt;br/&gt;of discrete-time Markov chains and the Monte Carlo Markov Chain&lt;br/&gt;method, (2) analysis of Markov chains for generating random&lt;br/&gt;permutations, and (3) resource allocation problems in distributed&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the area of general analysis of Markov chains the goal of the&lt;br/&gt;research is to develop new tools for the analysis of mixing times of&lt;br/&gt;Markov chains. An important part of this study is to investigate&lt;br/&gt;relationships between various known methods of the analysis of mixing&lt;br/&gt;times of Markov chains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the investigations of Markov chains for generating random&lt;br/&gt;permutations the main focus is on so called random switching&lt;br/&gt;networks. These networks model behavior of many Markov chains that&lt;br/&gt;are sought in applications in cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the area of resource allocation problems in distributed systems,&lt;br/&gt;the research focuses mostly on resource allocation problems in&lt;br/&gt;networks, in which the cost of the allocation depend on the routing&lt;br/&gt;properties of the input network as well as on the contention&lt;br/&gt;resolution protocols applied to the system.</AbstractNarration>
