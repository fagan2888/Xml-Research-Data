    <AbstractNarration>Atmospheric Sciences (41)&lt;br/&gt;The American Meteorological Society (AMS) in cooperation with the US National&lt;br/&gt;Weather Service and the Department of the Geosciences of North Carolina's Elizabeth&lt;br/&gt;City State University is providing professional development opportunities for 100 faculty at&lt;br/&gt;minority institutions with the goal of increasing minority student participation in&lt;br/&gt;science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Over a 4.5-year period, this&lt;br/&gt;project will attain this diversity-enhancing goal by making available to minority-serving&lt;br/&gt;colleges and universities Online Weather Studies, an existing AMS-developed distance-&lt;br/&gt;learning course on the basics of atmospheric science partially delivered via the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;Greater minority student participation in STEM requires greater access to&lt;br/&gt;scientific learning experiences that engage student interest and develop their critical&lt;br/&gt;thinking skills. Critical thinking and associated reasoning skills are considered essential&lt;br/&gt;for student success in STEM. Online Weather Studies is designed to meet this goal&lt;br/&gt;through electronic delivery of highly motivational investigations written to current&lt;br/&gt;weather conditions. To facilitate adoption and implementation of Online Weather&lt;br/&gt;Studies, the project provides professional development experiences for faculty (25 per&lt;br/&gt;year for 4 years) via a 5-day summer workshop at the National Weather Service Training&lt;br/&gt;Center (NWSTC) at Kansas City, MO plus a series of two-day workshops treating&lt;br/&gt;science content, pedagogical, and diversity issues as a regular feature of the AMS Annual&lt;br/&gt;Meeting held each January.</AbstractNarration>
