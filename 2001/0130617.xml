    <AbstractNarration>This action is to support a post-earthquake field survey of the magnitude Mw 8.1 earthquake that occurred on June 23, 2001 near the coast of southern Peru, about 175 km west of Arequipa or 595 km southeast of Lima. This earthquake caused extensive damage in the areas around the cities of Arequipa, Camana, Moquegua, and Tacna; part of the damage has been attributed to a tsunami wave in the Camana area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this geotechnical reconnaissance team is to document the geotechnical and engineering geology/seismology features of this earthquake. The team is being coordinated by Adrian Rodriguez-Marek of Washington State University and Pedro Repetto of URS Corporation, with collaboration of Joseph Wartman, Drexel University. Jorge Zegarra of the Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru is serving as the local contact and is assembling a team of local experts to participate in this reconnaissance effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this reconnaissance will yield information and data which will help the profession understand the effects of interplate subduction earthquakes on the built environment. These efforts will support the continuing efforts to reduce the earthquake risk posed by the Aleutian-Alaskan and Cascadia subduction zones in the United States. The results of the earthquake reconnaissance will be made available in two phases. In the first phase, the early reconnaissance reports will be posted on the Internet through the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center (PEER) web page at &lt;http://peer.berkeley.edu&gt;. The release of the report will be announced using the GEOTECH Internet mailing list. In the second phase, a more comprehensive final report will be prepared; it will be available as a hardcopy report or as an Adobe Acrobat file downloadable from the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
