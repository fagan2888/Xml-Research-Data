    <AbstractNarration>In this project supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry and the Geology and Paleontology Programs, Professor Klaus Schmidt-Rohr and coworkers at Iowa State University, advanced solid-state NMR methodologies will be developed and applied to identify at least 40 specific functional groups and estimate their concentrations in natural organic matter. This will be achieved by means of a set of efficient new spectral-editing pulse sequences based on heteronuclear dipolar couplings or chemical-shift anisotropies. Furthermore, the larger environment of a given functional group will be identified in two- and three-dimensional correlation experiments, and inhomogeneities on a 1- to 50-nm scale by spin diffusion. NMR dynamics measurements will enable the search for soft mobile regions that have been invoked to explain the partitioning of organic contaminants into soil organic matter. Near the end of the project, improved structural models for examples of soil and marine organic matter will be generated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will be used to elucidate the chemical and supramolecular structures of insoluble organic substances that are presented by the natural environment, such as soil and marine organic matter, kerogen, or bituminous materials. To this end, advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance methods are being developed that can identify and quantify a large number of chemical groups in organic solids. In addition, nanometer-scale domains will be characterized. The NMR methods will be used to characterize the chemical binding sites of contaminants; to help understand nutrient release into soil; to indicate methods for enhanced carbon sequestration in soil to reduce "greenhouse gases" in the atmosphere; and to shed light on the chemical processes of soil, kerogen, and fossil-fuel formation. This will help to provide deeper insights into the chemical history of natural organic matter, its role in the global carbon cycle, and the results of human activities on the environment.</AbstractNarration>
