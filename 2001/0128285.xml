    <AbstractNarration>The investigator organizes an international conference at&lt;br/&gt;Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques to study folding and&lt;br/&gt;self-assembly of macromolecules. Self-organization of&lt;br/&gt;macromolecules is a fundamental question in molecular biology.&lt;br/&gt;How molecules fold plays a major role in their organization. The&lt;br/&gt;meeting fosters the creation of new tools by bringing together&lt;br/&gt;scientists from several domains to consider the problem from&lt;br/&gt;different perspectives.&lt;br/&gt; DNA is like a long zipper whose teeth are pairs of&lt;br/&gt;molecules, called base pairs, one molecule on each side of the&lt;br/&gt;zipper. Links between the base pairs close the zipper. The zipper&lt;br/&gt;is about six feet long in human DNA; to fit inside a cell, it&lt;br/&gt;coils up. It partially uncoils to expose sections --- genes ---&lt;br/&gt;that are read to produce an intermediate molecule, called&lt;br/&gt;messenger RNA. Ribosomes read the messenger RNA and produce a&lt;br/&gt;corresponding amino acid chain. The chain folds up spontaneously;&lt;br/&gt;this is a protein. Proteins in turn perform their functions by&lt;br/&gt;partially unfolding to interact with other folded macromolecules.&lt;br/&gt;Proteins, genes, and DNA all fold and unfold to do their work. So&lt;br/&gt;folding and self-assembly are central issues in molecular&lt;br/&gt;biology. A goal of the conference is to stimulate synergistic&lt;br/&gt;interchanges between different disciplines by bringing together&lt;br/&gt;biologists, chemists, physicists, mathematicians, and computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists to discuss these issues from different perspectives.</AbstractNarration>
