    <AbstractNarration>The project will build on prior successful work and:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Explore extending the applicability of its criteria for evaluating materials to the elementary school level and to a greater variety of topics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Produce a set of interrelated on-line databases of instructional components -- research summaries, representations, phenomena and questions/tasks that developers can use to creat K-12 goals-based textbooks and other materials that focus on important ideas and skills in science, mathematics and technology. It is anticpated that these databases will also be valuable to practicing teachers (this component forming the basis for Project inservice programs) and to those designing preservice courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Create an expanded set of conceptual strand maps portraying students' growth of understanding for important topics such as weather and climate, basic functions of living things, energy conservation, and electricity and magnetism; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4) Create professional development workshop plans and presentation materials designed particularly for curriculum materials developers and educators responsible for evaluating and selecting textbooks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, a new component to the initiative will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Design strategies and create materials to help parents, decision-makers, and the public in general to understand basic scientific literacy. This component will include the Conover Miller Group/Global Strategy Group who will conduct public opinion/market research polls and develop a strategic communications plan. The Project will produce a customized website that links the resources of AAAS with other organizations such as the NSTA, NRC and the Annenberg/CPB Project to help teachers and parents increase their understanding of the important issues related to science education. This component will encourage teachers and parents to become more actively involved in their state's efforts to improve science education.</AbstractNarration>
