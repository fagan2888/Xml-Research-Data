    <AbstractNarration>Compact objects (neutron stars or black holes) can be found in nature&lt;br/&gt;in close binary systems orbiting each other. Such systems are expected&lt;br/&gt;to emit gravitational radiation of high frequency and therefore are&lt;br/&gt;thought to be excellent source candidates for the Laser Interferometer&lt;br/&gt;Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) planned to become operational in&lt;br/&gt;the next couple of years. Theoretical studies of such astrophysical&lt;br/&gt;sources of gravitational waves will be undertaken by the PI and a&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral fellow, and a number of questions will be addressed: &lt;br/&gt;(A) what is the predicted frequency with which binary compact objects of&lt;br/&gt;interest form in our Galaxy and out to extragalactic distances, what&lt;br/&gt;are the uncertainties of these predictions, and what do they imply&lt;br/&gt;about gravitational-wave detection, (B) what are the physical&lt;br/&gt;properties of these binaries (e.g., masses, eccentricities, spins,&lt;br/&gt;velocities) and how can gravitational-wave data analysis methods be&lt;br/&gt;optimized for their detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undoubted confirmation of the existence of gravitational waves as&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally predicted by the theory of general relativity can be&lt;br/&gt;provided only by their direct detection, expected by observatories such&lt;br/&gt;as LIGO. The detectability of binary compact objects depends on a&lt;br/&gt;number of factors related both to the astrophysical properties of the&lt;br/&gt;sources and the capabilities of the observatory. The research described&lt;br/&gt;above will contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;most promising gravitational-wave sources, optimize the relevant data&lt;br/&gt;analysis methods, and therefore improve the detectability prospects for&lt;br/&gt;LIGO.</AbstractNarration>
