    <AbstractNarration>Single molecule studies can provide unique information on the structure and dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;biological molecules and cellular complexes that is impossible to obtain using traditional&lt;br/&gt;structural techniques. These studies, to be performed at conditions close to physiological&lt;br/&gt;environments, open the way for looking directly at the function of individual biological&lt;br/&gt;molecules and their complexes. Scanning probe microscopy and atomic force microscope&lt;br/&gt;(AFM) in particular has proven to be a very useful technique permitting static and dynamic&lt;br/&gt;studies of molecules at nanometer range resolution. However, the requirement for the sample to&lt;br/&gt;be bound to the surface restricts considerably the dynamical studies. A breakthrough has&lt;br/&gt;recently been made in the real-time observation of dynamics of molecular complexes at the&lt;br/&gt;single-molecule level using single-photon sensitive fluorescence microscopes. However, the&lt;br/&gt;resolution of this technique is limited by the wavelength of the light and does not reveal&lt;br/&gt;structural details of molecules. The combination of AFM and a single molecule fluorescence&lt;br/&gt;(SMF) microscope into one instrument would enable us to identify structural details of&lt;br/&gt;biological systems at the molecular level by AFM and to use the SMF microscope to observe&lt;br/&gt;directly the dynamics of an experimental system at a the single molecule level. Importantly, the&lt;br/&gt;dynamics can be performed on molecular systems structurally characterized by AFM and&lt;br/&gt;localized on a comparatively large surface area. Therefore, the major objective of this proposal&lt;br/&gt;is to build AFM/SMF system based on the currently available Bioscope AFM/fluorescence&lt;br/&gt;microscope instrument. The sensitivity of the fluorescent system will be tested using specially&lt;br/&gt;designed samples. In addition, potential pitfalls of integrated AFM will be identified and&lt;br/&gt;analyzed for solutions.</AbstractNarration>
