    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;Our work is the adaptation of teaching methods developed in "Development of an Interdisciplinary Curriculum in Electronic Materials and Devices: Cooking Without Recipes" (NSF award # DUE - 9551520). Our curriculum has been developed to help undergraduate students who are interested in careers as processing engineers in microelectronics and related industries. This project helps students develop an in-depth understanding of the underlying physical and chemical principles in unit processes commonly used in microelectronics. These unit operations include plasma etching, chemical vapor deposition, spin coating, and chemical mechanical polishing. In addition we are introducing students to advance diagnostics tools which has helped us design more advanced microelectronics experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have also developed a curriculum that enables our students to acquire much needed "soft skills". These are necessary if our students are to succeed in their professional careers. These soft skills include technical writing, oral presentation, safety awareness, and teambuilding. We have extended our audience to include high school students who have participated in summer programs. Through these summer programs we are hoping to recruit underrepresented students into science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
