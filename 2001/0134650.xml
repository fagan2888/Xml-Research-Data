    <AbstractNarration>This proposal outlines a comprehensive career plan for advancement of research and education in the field of wireless mobile ad hoc networks. The research plan consists of two complementary pails. The first is to design and develop a novel architecture for scalable multicast routing in wide-area ad hoc networks, while the second part proposes new methodologies for evaluation of wireless ad hoc routing protocols. The educational plan includes developing wireless networking courses coupled with a laboratory, in addition to proposing novel methods to improve student participation in the learning process. Also, proposed to design a new scalable architecture for multicast services support in large-scale ad hoc networks, the first of its kind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program intends to fully utilize high/v adaptive mechanisms in the various components of the architecture. Specifically, to design an adaptive zone-based hierarchy augmented by the notion of contact nodes to increase network coverage. In addition, to provide novel schemes for multicast service support, based on adaptive anycast for resource discovery. Also, introduce geographic multicast address allocation to map groups into rendezvous regions. All the proposed mechanisms are self-configurable, and promise desirable scaling and robustness properties.</AbstractNarration>
