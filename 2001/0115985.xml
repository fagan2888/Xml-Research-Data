    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for NSF Proposal 0115985 to Dr. John La Duke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A grant has been awarded to Dr. John La Duke at the University of North Dakota to purchase a Genetic Analyzer. The major function of this instrument is to gather DNA data and analyze these sequences or fragments. This is a "state-of-the-art" instrument that will position researchers very positively for the future in the area of DNA methodology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four primary researchers on this project. Their research can be divided into two main areas. Two of these faculty, Austin and La Duke, are interested in phylogenetic/evolutionary questions. La Duke is examining the relationships of the species in the plant family Malvaceae. This family includes cotton and Hibiscus. Austin is interested in the relationships and distribution patterns of Pacific Island lizards. The other faculty, Detke and Young, are interested understanding the linkage of DNA sequences to biochemical pathways. Detke is interested in a protein from the parasite Leishmania that that may have implications in diseases caused by the parasite. Young is interested in proteins associated with bacterial cell walls and associated biosynthetic pathways. Each of the scientists has a history of training students at all levels and is passionate about research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The addition of this instrument will significantly enhance the research and training capabilities of the University of North Dakota. The impact of this instrument on the research programs of the Principal Investigators is only a small part of the potential impact this will have on: 1) training of students, 2) additional projects that can now be conceived, and 3) stimulating collaboration between researchers on the campus. . As the use and understanding of DNA data has become almost as standard as the microscope in biology, we believe it is essential for undergraduates to have training and exposure to the current technology in DNA data-gathering and analysis. It is expected that graduate students and faculty from both Biology and the Medical School will develop a closer interaction as a result of sharing this instrument.</AbstractNarration>
