    <AbstractNarration>Title: Algorithms for approximation and graph problems&lt;br/&gt;PI: Richard Cole&lt;br/&gt;CCR-0105678&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research concerns the finding of approximate solutions.&lt;br/&gt;It is often the case that finding exact solutions is vastly too&lt;br/&gt;expensive in terms of the time required, to the point of&lt;br/&gt;being infeasible. Yet fairly accurate solutions which are&lt;br/&gt;"good enough" may be obtainable in a much shorter time, and&lt;br/&gt;consequently be more practical. The specific problem domains&lt;br/&gt;on which this research focuses range from pattern matching&lt;br/&gt;(for example, devising algorithms to find similar and/or&lt;br/&gt;repeating patterns in DNA sequences) to intrinsically&lt;br/&gt;intractable problems such as the travelling salesman problem&lt;br/&gt;(which amounts to finding a shortest route connecting a&lt;br/&gt;collection of cities).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research on string matching is considering new notions&lt;br/&gt;of approximation so as to devise efficient algorithms for a&lt;br/&gt;broader class of approximate matches than is feasible presently;&lt;br/&gt;both searches between pairs of strings and against a database&lt;br/&gt;of strings are being studied. The second part of our research&lt;br/&gt;focuses on NP-hard problems. We are looking at multicost&lt;br/&gt;shortest path problems (e.g. with a cost comprising both&lt;br/&gt;time and price) in which one seeks all non-dominated solutions,&lt;br/&gt;at improving the quality of approximations for the Travelling&lt;br/&gt;Salesman Problem in the plane, and also at improving the&lt;br/&gt;approximations obtainable for generalized Steiner Tree problems.</AbstractNarration>
