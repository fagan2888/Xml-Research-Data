    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arctic Alive&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Arctic Alive is an e-learning project that brings cutting-edge geosciences research to the K-12 classroom, integrates geosciences curriculum, provides opportunities for K-12 teachers to work with scientists, and promotes global understanding about the value and worldwide significance of the Arctic region. Arctic Alive focuses on arctic research, the importance of the arctic region including its role in global climate change, and its extraordinary environments and diverse cultures. Science is the central curriculum theme, while technology is the catalyst. Arctic Alive is an interactive, real-time, and unique web-based education program. It uses a variety of delivery methods and e-learning strategies to deliver arctic research to the classroom. Two key program components are a teacher in the field with the geoscientists to facilitate activities in the classroom, and student interactions with the researchers. Educators and students integrate the Arctic Alive program not only into their sciences curriculum but also social studies and technology curricula. The Arctic Alive program aligns with National Education Standards in technology, science, and math, as well as Alaska Content Standards for Students.</AbstractNarration>
