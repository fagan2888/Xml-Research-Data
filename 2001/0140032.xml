    <AbstractNarration>This proposal supports an experimental research program that studies atomic coherence and interference phenomena in cold atoms, and explores related applications in nonlinear optics and quantum optics. The approach is based on interactions of multilevel atoms with multiple laser fields that lead to electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and dramatic enhancement of optical nonlinearities. Cold atoms confined in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) are well suited for this type of fundamental studies because of the high atomic density in a MOT and the near zero Doppler shift experienced by the atoms. The objectives are to study nonlinear optical phenomena manifested by quantum coherence and interference at low light intensities and carry out nonlinear spectroscopic measurements in coherently prepared rubidium atoms. Specific experiments include giant Kerr nonlinearities manifested by EIT, absorptive photon switching at the single-photon energy level, the EIT enhanced four-wave mixing at low light intensities and its application in photon storage and recall, experimental quantification of dark-state decoherence, and the time-dependent response of the EIT medium. The program provides research related education and training activities for graduate and undergraduate students, especially for minority students, who make up more than 65% of the total student population at Florida International University.</AbstractNarration>
