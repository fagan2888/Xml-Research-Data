    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase II Project will validate the polymer infiltration/microwave pyrolysis (PIMP) process and ceramic product whose feasibility was demonstrated in Phase I. The Phase I project demonstrated a reduction in pyrolysis time of greater than 90%; the Phase II project will confirm a corresponding cost reduction. During the Phase I, a strategic partnership with a major original equipment manufacturer (OEM) was established. The Phase II project will refine the process to produce ceramic parts for a specific commercial application, and will validate the weight and performance enhancements projected in Phase I. The PIMP process will be expanded to the pilot plant scale, and with the collaboration of the OEM and a business development specialist.&lt;br/&gt; Commercial applications exist for fiber-reinforced ceramics, if they can be produced at low cost. The potential applications range from gas-fired turbine engines for power plants and aircraft to brakes, waste incineration and chemical production.</AbstractNarration>
