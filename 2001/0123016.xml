    <AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. T. Patrick Culbert, Mr. Arturo Munoz will collect data for his dissertation. For the last four years Mr. Munoz has been a member of the archaeological team excavating the ruins of the Classic Maya city of Piedras Negras, Guatemala. Piedras Negras is located in a remote corner of the Peten rainforest and is renowned for the excellent quality of its sculpture and for the unusually complete sequence of dated stelae erected by the cities rulers between A.D. 650 and 800. Piedras Negras is particularly notable because of the heavy emphasis on resist decoration on locally made ceramics. This technique, virtually unknown in other parts of the Maya Lowlands, dominates the Late Classic polychrome ceramic tradition at Piedras Negras. Because of the unusually complete historical record for the site as well as the excellent provenance data available as a result of the recent excavations it is possible to track the development and spread of resist decorated ceramics with a rare degree of precision. Resist decorated ceramic appear first in elite contexts. They are carefully decorated and well fired. Later, more crudely executed resist types become common and are recovered from all levels of settlement. These observations lead to several hypotheses amenable to testing utilizing a variety of quantitative measures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In general terms, this research is a diachronic study of changing ceramic styles, framing the development of resist-decorated ceramics first as a result of particular historical and social circumstances at Piedras Negras and second, and more broadly, as a result if general processes linking crafting and the possession of cultural goods to processes of political legitimation. With very few exceptions, Americanist archaeologists rarely consider the social component of technological change, becoming what have been described as "somnambulists" adopting the position that technological change unfolds automatically according to its own inevitable logic and independently of social and cultural processes. As a result, most archaeological research focusing on technological change has emphasized the effects of increased efficiency on mitigating changing environmental or other conditions. If this research is successful, it will present a model for understanding processes of technological change emphasizing the importance social processes in determining not only the content of emerging technologies, but also their success or failure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a variety of reasons the Usumacinta Basin is one of the most understudied part so the Maya Lowlands. This research will provide some of the very first detailed data for the region, and will provide key information on one of the preeminent Lowland Maya sites. This research will not only be a valuable reference for future archaeologists working in the area, it will also interest any member of Guatemalan society curious about their country's ancient past. Finally, this research will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.</AbstractNarration>
