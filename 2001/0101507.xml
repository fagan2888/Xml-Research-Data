    <AbstractNarration>AgTEC, a National Partnership, is improving the mathematics, science, and technical competencies of agriculture technology graduates who are preparing for careers that support the most efficient and sustainable food and fiber production in the world. Kirkwood Community College with partner colleges, secondary schools, and universities, guided by the vision of the agriculture industry, is institutionalizing improvements in select agriculture technology education programs that serve as models for the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this vision, AgTEC is focusing on three areas of activity: curriculum development, faculty development and capacity building. Specific directions in each of these activity areas are being determined annually by a Critical Issues Conference. Conference breakout sessions address needs and establish outcomes for annual projects. Projects are being accomplished by a team of lead partners and then institutionalized, in following years, by all appropriate partners. The annual conferences also address best practices in the three primary areas of activity as improvements are institutionalized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In curriculum development, the center is (a) defining advanced technological careers in Agriculture Business/Services, Agriculture Production, Agriculture Science and Advanced Agriculture Technology, and identifying the knowledge and skill competencies required by students entering careers in these fields; (b) validating and enhancing existing curriculum and developing new curriculum driven by emerging technologies and critical issues influencing 21st century agriculture; and (c) developing all courses/modules with strong science, mathematics, and technical skill components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The center is also helping to develop faculty expertise by (a) hosting workshops for college and high school instructors to strengthen their skills in using and applying new technology, curriculum, and electronic resources; (b) coordinating instructor internships at agricultural research centers and in industry; (c) identifying and promoting model agriculture teacher education programs at four-year colleges and universities; and (d) assisting partner colleges and high schools to integrate advanced mathematics, science and technology through one-on-one mentoring and technical assistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To help build capacity, the center and partner colleges are enrolling students previously denied access to advanced Agriculture Technology Education by identifying and implementing successful recruitment and retention models. The Center is maintaining a national clearinghouse of electronic resources and reports to be used by the nation's educational institutions for program improvement and facilitating 2 + 2 + 2 articulation between high schools, two-year and four-year colleges and universities. Ongoing assistance is being provided by an Industry Council of leading agri-businesses, a University Council of leading university agriculture programs, and local teams of community colleges, universities, and secondary agriculture programs.</AbstractNarration>
