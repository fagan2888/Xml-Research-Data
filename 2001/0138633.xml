    <AbstractNarration>Abstract. A grant has been awarded to Dr. James Albert and Mr. George&lt;br/&gt;Burgess at Florida Museum of Natural History to improve the Ichthyological&lt;br/&gt;Collection. Species are in decline around the world as we pass through a&lt;br/&gt;wave of mass extinctions due to human activities. While the biodiversity&lt;br/&gt;crisis accelerates efforts are being made to preserve our genetic heritage&lt;br/&gt;for future generations. The Florida Museum of Natural History&lt;br/&gt;ichthyological collection is a significant national resource, with&lt;br/&gt;principal strengths in western and eastern Atlantic shelf and deepwater&lt;br/&gt;marine fishes, western Atlantic reef fishes, and freshwater fishes from the&lt;br/&gt;Southeastern United States, Central and northern South America, and the&lt;br/&gt;West Indies. The UF collection continues to grow and is used by researchers&lt;br/&gt;throughout the nation and the world. The Florida Museum ichthyological&lt;br/&gt;collection presently contains about 216,000 identified lots (jars) bearing&lt;br/&gt;close to 2.2 million specimens ascribed to approximately 6,600 species. Of&lt;br/&gt;these about 150,000 lots are electronically catalogued. Among the&lt;br/&gt;uncatalogued materials are an estimated 73,000 lots of specimens identified&lt;br/&gt;to species acquired from orphaned collections. These uncatalogued lots&lt;br/&gt;include some of the Florida Museum's most valuable materials. At present a&lt;br/&gt;large number of these specimens are not electronically catalogued, greatly&lt;br/&gt;restricting their use and access. The lack of availability to these&lt;br/&gt;substantial resources on electronic databases dramatically reduces their&lt;br/&gt;utility and represents a significant loss of research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will electronically catalogue and physically integrate&lt;br/&gt;orphaned lots into the existing Florida Museum collection in newly provided&lt;br/&gt;facilities. The specific goals are to: 1: Install mobile, high density&lt;br/&gt;shelving units in the newly allocated space. 2. Electronically catalog&lt;br/&gt;46,500 identified lots. 3: Physically integrate these materials into the&lt;br/&gt;existing catalogued collection on newly purchased and existing compactor&lt;br/&gt;shelving units. All lots will receive new labels, be topped off or receive&lt;br/&gt;new alcohol as needed, receive new closures or be rebottled if appropriate,&lt;br/&gt;and be shelved with conspecifics on compacted shelving units. To facilitate&lt;br/&gt;continued safety and access throughout the cataloguing process all&lt;br/&gt;materials will be maintained in phylogenetic order by family in&lt;br/&gt;air-conditioned facilities provided with access aisles. To expedite&lt;br/&gt;incorporation of new collections we will minimize new taxonomic&lt;br/&gt;identifications. Specimens representing highly redundant taxa or those&lt;br/&gt;terminally damaged will be recorded and discarded.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronic cataloguing of the orphaned materials will substantially&lt;br/&gt;increase the flow of information into and out of the Florida Museum&lt;br/&gt;collection as a whole. Cataloguing and integrating orphaned ichthyological&lt;br/&gt;collections will provide visiting scholars, students and users of the&lt;br/&gt;Florida Museum and Internet databases access to these important data.&lt;br/&gt;Achieving the project objectives will facilitate long-term growth of the&lt;br/&gt;collection, promote research into the catalogued materials, and greatly&lt;br/&gt;increase the long-term management and public outreach capabilities of the&lt;br/&gt;Florida Museum and its information resources. These results will enhance&lt;br/&gt;the role of the University of Florida as a center for the education and&lt;br/&gt;training of a new generation of scientists in aquatic biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>
