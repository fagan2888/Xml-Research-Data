    <AbstractNarration>This project provides for summer workshops for computer science faculty on the use of history in improving undergraduate computer science instruction. The workshops target computer science faculty who agree to incorporate units or modules dealing with history into their courses in the year after the workshop. First year workshop participants serve as mentors to the second year participants. Speakers at the workshops are individuals known nationally for efforts on behalf of computing history and instructional curricula and materials that include computing history. This project encourages the participants to develop and adapt exemplary materials for use in their classes and includes dissemination to the computer science community for possible use and adaptation by others.</AbstractNarration>
