    <AbstractNarration>This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) will investigate the propagation of power over distance using electromagnetic waves. Transmission of power from space using microwaves (a particular form of electromagnetic radiation) and lasers has been discussed for more than thirty years. It is proposed to update the discussion, review current capabilities and relevant issues, hold a workshop of interested parties, and to develop a report on the topic. This proposal presents a possible outline of the report and describes the process to be followed in developing the research report.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All electromagnetic, or radio waves, contain power. The most familiar topical reference is the propagation of power in cellular radio systems. A basestation transmits power in the direction of a user. This power spreads out as the radio wave beam diverges over distance. The transmission of significant amounts of power from one point to another on earth has been demonstrated. However the main interest in microwave transmission of power is to collect power in space (where solar radiation is available 24 hours a day) and transmit it efficiently to anywhere on earth using a narrow, controlled, beam. Transmitting power as a laser beam is an alternative. Finally the microwave power is converted to power for use as mains electricity. The recent decade has seen considerable developments that would assist this process. Power could be beamed to remote locations, be used in other space-born applications, provide emergency power, or be used as top-up power as needed. A study is required to determine the current feasibility eif his means of power transmission, briefly determine the environmental impact of high power transmission, and briefly outline the economic issues. Experiments are to be proposed that will enable the issues to be explored further.</AbstractNarration>
