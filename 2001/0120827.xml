    <AbstractNarration>Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research examines distributed sensing and control as an integral component of self-healing structures. This research integrates structural health monitoring methods with smart materials, statistical pattern recognition, and control to produce a class of structures having the ability to detect damage and to perform active control to compensate for the damage. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed research consist of:&lt;br/&gt;1) Integrating pattern recognition and data compression into the impedance-based health monitoring technique;&lt;br/&gt;2) Integrating elements of health monitoring and control to create self-repairing structures and machines;&lt;br/&gt;3) Investigating temperature and pressure effects on simultaneous health monitoring and control;&lt;br/&gt;4) Experimentally verifying our results and using the results of our experiments to modify and improve our theories;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The engineering results of this research are systems that detect a problem, warn of the existence of the detected damage and then make a temporary repair, all while remaining in service. This scenario would allow systems to remain in service after a problem develops and to continue in operation until a convenient time for a more permanent repair is possible. By making the structures substantially easier to inspect and resistant to failure, costly periodic "down-time" of equipment will be significantly reduced. Industrial structures such as airframes, automobiles and machines can benefit from the application of the technology developed in this proposal.</AbstractNarration>
