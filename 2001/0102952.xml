    <AbstractNarration>Chief objectives of this bi-national workshop are to: exchange latest research findings in vibration and noise engineering; invite industry to identify key research questions and trends that must be urgently addressed; and form collaborative teams and provide an opportunity for a closer interaction between leading U.S. and Indian experts. The 3-day joint symposium will be held at the Center for Automotive Research at The Ohio State University in the fall of 2001. The symposium builds on a similarly focused small workshop that took place at IIT Delhi, India in 1996. Pre and post workshop activities will include industrial R&amp;D visits and short courses. Technical topics include vibro-acoustic analyses of structures, equipment and vehicles, machine dynamics, signal processing and diagnostics, spatial domain measurements, non-linear problems, computational techniques, dynamic design concepts, passive and active damping, smart actuators and sensors, and the like. A special issue of the Journal of Sound and Vibration will be published based on the articles presented at the workshop. This symposium intends to identify common international interests and priorities in the area of noise and vibration control and focus on important relevant scientific issues.</AbstractNarration>
