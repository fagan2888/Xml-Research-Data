    <AbstractNarration>We investigate the classification of compact topological and smooth&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, as well as embedding problems - knot theory. We use both new&lt;br/&gt;and classical homological, geometric and analytic techniques such as&lt;br/&gt;algebraic L-and K-theory, controlled topology, operator theory and Von&lt;br/&gt;Neumann signatures. One problem attacked, from differential geometry, is&lt;br/&gt;to determine whether almost flat manifolds bound compact manifolds. New&lt;br/&gt;knot invariants, defined during the prior grant, are continuing to reveal&lt;br/&gt;new and unexpected knotting phenomena and will be used to further&lt;br/&gt;investigate the classification of topological four manifolds within a&lt;br/&gt;fixed homology type. These invariants will also be applied to further&lt;br/&gt;compute the topological concordance group of knots, and to the rich&lt;br/&gt;structure of three manifolds as seen through descending series of the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental group. Another problem is to compute and apply characteristic&lt;br/&gt;classes for combinatorial vector bundles, an initial step in understanding&lt;br/&gt;a new category of manifolds - the combinatorial differentiable manifolds&lt;br/&gt;of Gelfand-MacPherson. A final topic is the computation of algebraic K-&lt;br/&gt;and L-theory using controlled topology and applying these computations to&lt;br/&gt;manifolds with fixed fundamental group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A n-dimensional manifold is a set of points which is locally modeled on an&lt;br/&gt;n-dimensional linear space. For instance a surface is a locally&lt;br/&gt;2-dimensional linear space, such as a sphere, or the surface of a donut&lt;br/&gt;(torus). The principal problem of geometric topology is the&lt;br/&gt;classification of manifolds. In differential topology we also ask how&lt;br/&gt;many ways we may do calculus on a given manifold, addressing the&lt;br/&gt;uniqueness question. The fundamental group of a manifold gives an&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structure to the collection of all loops in the manifold, thus&lt;br/&gt;providing a pathway to algebra. The researchers focus on both high&lt;br/&gt;dimensional and low dimensional manifolds. Four dimensional manifolds are&lt;br/&gt;of particular interest as the results and techniques in this dimension&lt;br/&gt;manifest the harmony of the algebraic techniques which have found success&lt;br/&gt;in high dimensional manifold topology and the geometric techniques which&lt;br/&gt;prevail in dimension three. Investigating the foundations of manifold and&lt;br/&gt;knot theory fundamentally underpins our understanding of geometry,&lt;br/&gt;algebra, physics and differential equations. Additionally, knot theory&lt;br/&gt;plays a growing role in string theory, quantum field theory and the study&lt;br/&gt;of DNA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;---------- Forwarded message ----------&lt;br/&gt;Date: Fri, 11 May 2001 14:27:02 -0500 (EST)&lt;br/&gt;From: "James F. Davis" &lt;jfdavis@indiana.edu&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To: Christopher Stark &lt;cstark@nsf.gov&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cc: korr@indiana.edu&lt;br/&gt;Subject: Re: NSF proposal recommendation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hi Chris,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Kent and I were very happy to here that you plan to recommend that&lt;br/&gt;our NSF proposal be granted. However, some of circumstances have changed&lt;br/&gt;since we wrote the proposal, so I thought I should discuss them with you&lt;br/&gt;in case the budget is affected. Sorry for the delay getting back to you,&lt;br/&gt;I was visiting the University of Chicago this week.&lt;br/&gt; We asked for summer money to support three graduate students: Karl&lt;br/&gt;Bloch, Diarmuid Crowley, and Tae-Hee Kim. Well, I am happy to report&lt;br/&gt;that Diarmuid Crowley has been named a Clay Mathematical Institute&lt;br/&gt;Lift-Off Mathematician &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.claymath.org/researchers/index.htm&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;and will receive some money from them this summer (provided some visa&lt;br/&gt;problems work out.) He is suggesting to Clay that they award him the&lt;br/&gt;money from June 13 to July 27. After Aug 1, I believe he will be&lt;br/&gt;supported by Max Planck Institute in Bonn. However, he could still use&lt;br/&gt;NSF money, for example, he is attending the 3-week School on&lt;br/&gt;high-dimensional manifold topology in at the ICTP in Trieste, Italy,&lt;br/&gt;mostly at his own expense. Please advise us if it is necessary to&lt;br/&gt;rebudget and return the money allotted to Diarmuid.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The second change is with regard to my proposed REU student, Matt&lt;br/&gt;Cecil. Matt Cecil worked with me as an REU student last summer (partially&lt;br/&gt;supported by NSF funds), and continued throughout the academic year. He&lt;br/&gt;is attending UCSD as a math graduate student in the fall. However, due to&lt;br/&gt;mathematical reasons and personal reasons, he will not be an REU student&lt;br/&gt;with me this summer. So the question again is - what to do with the money&lt;br/&gt;allotted to him? I talked to our chair, Dan Maki, and he said that he&lt;br/&gt;could use the money to help undergraduate research projects connected with&lt;br/&gt;industry. Dan has many industrial contacts throughout the state of&lt;br/&gt;Indiana and had lead such projects for several years. The money would&lt;br/&gt;primarily go to student travel expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; So, Chris, please advise on whether we should give some money back to&lt;br/&gt;the NSF and rebudget, or just go with the modifications outlined above.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jim</AbstractNarration>
