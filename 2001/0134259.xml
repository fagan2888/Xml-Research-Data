    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues&lt;br/&gt;will address a number of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems about&lt;br/&gt;the geometry and arithmetic of moduli spaces:&lt;br/&gt;What is the canonical model of the moduli space of curves of genus g?&lt;br/&gt;Can one construct natural spaces that interpolate between the&lt;br/&gt;canonical model and the moduli space of stable curves?&lt;br/&gt;Can these be interpretted as moduli spaces in their own right?&lt;br/&gt;Can one count the number of rational&lt;br/&gt;points of moduli spaces of curves, bounded&lt;br/&gt;with respect to various heights? What are the natural&lt;br/&gt;functions (effective divisors) one might use to specify these&lt;br/&gt;heights?&lt;br/&gt;What are the naturally defined strata&lt;br/&gt;in the deformation space of a plane curve singularity?&lt;br/&gt;How can one interpret blow-ups along such strata?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions&lt;br/&gt;to systems of polynomial equations. Geometric&lt;br/&gt;aspects of the solution sets translate into algebraic&lt;br/&gt;properties of the equations, and vice versa. This&lt;br/&gt;approach has the advantage that computers can&lt;br/&gt;manipulate equations very efficiently. Promising&lt;br/&gt;hypotheses can thus be checked on explicit examples.&lt;br/&gt;Increasingly, computational approaches to geometry&lt;br/&gt;are transforming the education of undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students, both in pure mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and in related fields where mathematics is applied.&lt;br/&gt;This emphasis on concrete examples and explicit computation&lt;br/&gt;creates new research opportunities for young people,&lt;br/&gt;especially those who have only just started to learn&lt;br/&gt;the technical intricacies of the subject.</AbstractNarration>
