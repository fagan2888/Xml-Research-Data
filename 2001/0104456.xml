    <AbstractNarration>Prop: AST-0104456&lt;br/&gt;PI: Hooper, Eric&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Hooper is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at the University of Texas at Austin. His research focuses on understanding the phenomenon of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) by constructing a sample that is broadly representative and fully characterized. He will obtain spectroscopy for source characterization and the determination of multi-epoch luminosity functions of a subsample of objects observed with the Chandra X-ray telescope. The resulting sample will incorporate most known AGN types and include previously hidden populations. Dr. Hooper's educational activities will include participation in a science teacher training program, known as UTeach, being developed at the University. He plans to offer an upper-division course on research methods which is aimed at synthesizing the students' previous course work and developing independent problem solving skills. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
