    <AbstractNarration>0105321 Theis This grant provides support for a conference entitled "Summer 2001 Symposium on Sustainability" to be convened by the Center for Environmental Management at Clarkson University in June 2001. The symposium will bring together educators, students, researchers and practitioners with a common agenda, but different backgrounds in natural and industrial ecology, engineering and science, economics, management and social sciences, and environmental policy to investigate the basis of sustainability, factors asociated with its applicability and the possibility of progressing towards an agreement of research and education principles and methodologies that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. This symposium will emphasize the integration of research and educational approaches to sustainability and, therefore, graduate student participation is central to its objectives. The symposium will be organized around four overlapping research areas: Industrial Ecology, Ecological Economics, Ecosystem Health and Environmental Policy with the overarching goal to foster further collaboration among individual researchers and educators in these areas. &lt;br/&gt;A major output of the symposium will be the publication of principal findings in the peer-reviewed academic journals affilitated with the above four areas: Ecological Economics, Journal of Industrial Ecology, Ecosystem Health, and Environmental Engineering and Policy. Additionally, the Center will dedicate a special section of its web pages to the conference and proceedings. ***</AbstractNarration>
