    <AbstractNarration>This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project aims to extend the results of basic research in an industrial setting to assist in the development of a more reconfigurable line boring process. Line boring is widely used to machine a concentric line of bores, such as those for an engine camshaft or crankshaft. The industrial partner, Lamb Technicon Machining Systems, recently completed a prototype flexible line-boring machine, but further development is needed for its "smart tool", which is to provide compensation for tool vibration through internal laser feedback and piezoelectric actuation. A new process stability solution that addresses the real, corner-radiused tooth geometry seen in boring operations will be extended to account for the dynamic effects of the tool's guide-pads, the actuator and the controller. A new cutting tooth concept will then be modeled and analyzed toward reducing the radial machining force by 50%. Model-based tooth designs will be tested to compare forces, cutting power and tool wear to those measured using conventional corner-radiused tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the extended stability solution will help avoid instability that can damage the expensive smart tool. Having a science-based tool like this is particularly important here due to the added complexity of the system. If the radial force can then be reduced through the new cutting tooth concept, either the requirements on actuator size and power will be reduced or increased actuator motion will be achieved. This will facilitate smaller boring bars and less demand on the actuator power-induction system that must operate across a rotating interface. Perhaps the most important outcome of this collaboration will be the bilateral impact on the research programs of both Lamb Technicon and the investigator. The investigator will bring specific expertise to the smart tool problem while learning more about the industry's true needs and their day-to-day challenges</AbstractNarration>
