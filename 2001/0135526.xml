    <AbstractNarration>The Arizona-Rural Systemic Initiative (AZ-RSI) proposes to create a learning environment to improve science, mathematics and technology education in 22 rural, economically disadvantaged K-12 schools/communities with high American Indian and Hispanic enrollments. The 22 schools are located within the boundaries of 7 public school districts and 2 Bureau of Indian Affairs agencies with a total student enrollment of 9,698. The AZ-RSI is a partnership among the 22 rural schools, 2 County School Offices, Arizona State University East, and WestEd Education Laboratory. Memoranda of Agreement with school boards support the proposed implementation plan to improve mathematics and science education for nearly 10,000 students by focusing on comprehensive and cohesive capacity-building at the local site. The AZ-RSI has designed an implementation plan that emphasizes reform at the school level. The plan is flexible and full of technical assistance and leadership training for all stakeholders to help build requisite capacity for implementing and sustaining lasting reform. The AZ-RSI has formed a highly qualified management team to oversee the implementation plan. Field specialists with expertise in classroom implementation of effective instructional strategies and experience in education reform will provide on-site support to Local Leadership Teams. Said teams will implement school-wide plans to improve mathematics and science for all students with the help from field specialists. The AZ-RSI anticipates that the overall impacts will be improved student achievement in mathematics and science in participating schools, increased capacity of schools to sustain improvements, and a significant contribution to rural education research.</AbstractNarration>
