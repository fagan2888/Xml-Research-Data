    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Paul Smith's College (PSC), located in the Adirondack Park of New York State, offers students the opportunity to pursue a baccalaureate degree in Natural Resources. We are actively re-evaluating our course curricula to provide students with a set of science experiences and research challenges that build upon one another across a course sequence. This project will develop a series of hierarchical research and modeling activities that effectively scaffold the process of scientific inquiry across the sequence of courses leading to a degree. Data collected by classes throughout this process will be added to a data repository and will be accessible to future Paul Smith's College students. These data will also be available to other interested members of the Adirondack community. Several activities designed for introductory courses will improve question development, and hypothesis testing skills. Activities designed for second and third year courses will introduce simulation models that allow students to expand their research ideas across larger spatial and longer temporal scales. Finally, in the third phase, students will work with STELLA, and other computer models to build and parameterize simple ecological models, explore model assumptions, and conduct sensitivity analyses. In all phases, oral and written presentation skills and collaboration will be emphasized. At the onset of the project, PSC faculty will be involved in a two-day workshop to field-test activities, discuss project implementation with science education experts, and work with new computer programs.</AbstractNarration>
