    <AbstractNarration>In this project, meteorologists and applied mathematicians are&lt;br/&gt;collaborating to study the "weak temperature gradient" (WTG) equations for&lt;br/&gt;large-scale tropical atmospheric dynamics. The WTG equations form a&lt;br/&gt;"balance model", or set of singular limit equations, asymptotically valid&lt;br/&gt;in a parameter regime relevant to the tropical atmosphere. The WTG&lt;br/&gt;equations are designed to facilitate study of key aspects of the tropical&lt;br/&gt;climate problem, such as the large-scale dynamical roles of moist&lt;br/&gt;convection and other diabatic processes. This focus is achieved by&lt;br/&gt;eliminating other processes which can be present in solutions to the&lt;br/&gt;primitive equations, such as gravity waves and baroclinic instability, in&lt;br/&gt;the same way as gravity waves are eliminated in extratropical balance&lt;br/&gt;models such as the quasi-geostrophic equations. One goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to develop new mathematics by studying the WTG equations' properties.&lt;br/&gt;Another goal is to solve the equations under geometries, boundary&lt;br/&gt;conditions and forcings which represent idealizations of those relevant to&lt;br/&gt;the real earth's climate, and then to study the sensitivity of the&lt;br/&gt;solutions to key parameters. Achievement of these goals is expected to&lt;br/&gt;lead to deeper understanding of both the real climate and more complex&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models of it, such as general circulation models (GCMs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The earth's climate system is notoriously complex. Many different&lt;br/&gt;physical processes interact in a tangled web of feedbacks to produce the&lt;br/&gt;dynamic and variable climate we observe. Unlike a laboratory science,&lt;br/&gt;meteorology and oceanography are hindered by the impossibility of&lt;br/&gt;controlled experiments which might allow the key mechanisms to be&lt;br/&gt;conclusively revealed. We are stuck with the one planet on which we live&lt;br/&gt;and cannot change its basic properties to see what happens. Consequently,&lt;br/&gt;the science proceeds by observation and by a heavy reliance on numerical&lt;br/&gt;simulation with GCMs, which are sophisticated computer programs run on the&lt;br/&gt;most powerful computers available. These simulations offer the&lt;br/&gt;possibility of a certain kind of controlled climate experiments: we can&lt;br/&gt;create virtual earths on the computer, control their properties, and&lt;br/&gt;observe their behavior with precision. One obvious limitation of this&lt;br/&gt;approach is that the models are imperfect representations of reality. A&lt;br/&gt;less obvious, but equally important problem is the models' complexity,&lt;br/&gt;which both limits the number and type of simulations which can be done and&lt;br/&gt;renders the results nearly as difficult to understand as the real climate&lt;br/&gt;system. Because of these problems, there is a need to supplement&lt;br/&gt;observational and GCM studies with theoretical studies using models that&lt;br/&gt;are simpler than GCMs - if not simple enough to allow solution with pencil&lt;br/&gt;and paper, then at least using very simple computer programs that run&lt;br/&gt;quickly on a PC. To the extent that these simpler models have key&lt;br/&gt;features in common with the real system, their simplicity allows a deeper&lt;br/&gt;level of understanding of the basic dynamics of climate and leads to&lt;br/&gt;explicit hypotheses that can be tested against observations and GCM&lt;br/&gt;simulations. This project harnesses the physical insight of climate&lt;br/&gt;scientists and the sophisticated methods of applied mathematicians to&lt;br/&gt;develop and study simple models designed specifically to represent the&lt;br/&gt;tropical atmospheric component of the earth's climate system.</AbstractNarration>
