    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;THERMES 2002 is a workshop/conference which will focus on the recent advances in thermal management and characterization schemes, as well as forecasts and analyses of future trends. It is to be held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in early 2002. Thermal issues are key in electronic product development at all levels of the electronic product hierarchy, from the chip to the ultimate system. Shrinking system sizes are resulting in increasing volumetric heat generation rates and surface heat fluxes in many products. In addition to the U.S. participants, a significant international participation from Europe and Asia is expected. Invited talks in selected emerging areas will be complemented with contributed papers. Panel discussions focusing on technology and market trends and identification of research challenges will be included. The funds will help support travel for U.S. participants consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and non-tenured faculty with limited research funding.</AbstractNarration>
