    <AbstractNarration>The FASEB Summer Conference on Prokaryotic Transcription Initiation will be held July 14-19, 2001, at the Vermont Academy in Saxton's River, Vermont. The meeting will bring together biochemists, biophysicists, and geneticists. It will focus on eubacteria, but there will be consideration of both archaea and eukaryotes where comparison is interesting. Areas of intense study that will be featured at the 2001 FASEB conference include the following:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Structure of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases&lt;br/&gt;2. Sigma factors and core interactions&lt;br/&gt;3. Promoter recognition and initiation&lt;br/&gt;4. Transcription activation&lt;br/&gt;5. Complex regulation&lt;br/&gt;6. Global regulation&lt;br/&gt;7. Formation and stability of elongation complexes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All cells regulate the flow of information from DNA to protein at several different levels. A primary, and most economical, target of regulation is the initiation of transcription, the process by which the information in a gene on a chromosome is encoded in a small (relative to a chromosome) mobile form for use by the cell. Using easily manipulated bacterial systems, scientists have discovered many fundamental principles of transcriptional regulation and are exploring many more today. This meeting will facilitate the free exchange of experimental results and ideas so essential to this scientific search. The financial support provided by the National Science Foundation will enable students and postdoctoral fellows to attend this important meeting.</AbstractNarration>
