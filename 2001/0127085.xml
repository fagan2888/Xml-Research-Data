    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;In Fall 2000, the Department of Technology at SWTSU was authorized to begin the first engineering program on campus, a curriculum leading to a B. S. in Manufacturing Engineering. Present courses in digital electronics, controls, and semiconductor manufacturing are suitable for a technology curriculum but need substantial upgrading and enhancement to support the new engineering program. The objective of this proposal is to provide hardware and software to implement a number of new educational initiatives in several courses which are going to support this new program. These initiatives are adapting ideas from institutions such as Texas A&amp;M and Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI) to develop a curriculum suited to SWTSU environment, which draws heavily from rural, minority and female population pools in Central Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The courses targeted for improvement are in Digital Electronics, Control Systems and Instrumentation, and Microelectronics Manufacturing (a two-semester sequence). The strengths of the hands-on teaching approach that is common in technology programs is being applied to develop laboratory-intensive course modules suitable for modern manufacturing engineers. Such a hands-on applications approach to engineering education is intended to cater to the learning styles of all students. The experience gained through faculty development and implementation of these changes helps to establish the manufacturing engineering program on a firm foundation, adding to the pool of skilled engineering personnel which are badly needed in this region.</AbstractNarration>
