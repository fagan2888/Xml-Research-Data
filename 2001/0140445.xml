    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies the theory of algebraic cobordism, &lt;br/&gt;recently constructed by the investigor and F. Morel, as well &lt;br/&gt;as generalized cohomology theories for algebraic varieties &lt;br/&gt;and schemes, the relation of rational equivalence in the &lt;br/&gt;Morel-Voevodsky algebraic-homotopy category, and a refinement &lt;br/&gt;of Asakura's arithmetic Hodge cohomology. The investigator &lt;br/&gt;attempts to construct a theory of higher algebraic cobordism, &lt;br/&gt;along the lines of Bloch's higher Chow groups, examines the &lt;br/&gt;category of cobordism motives, and tries to give a theory of &lt;br/&gt;algebraic higher elliptic genera. In addition, the investigator &lt;br/&gt;examines the generalization of the motivic cohomology to K-theory&lt;br/&gt;spectral sequence to other cohomology theories on algebraic &lt;br/&gt;varieties, and considers the relationship of this spectral &lt;br/&gt;sequence to the slice spectral sequence of Voevodsky, using the &lt;br/&gt;notion of rational equivalence in the algebraic homotopy category. &lt;br/&gt;Finally the investigator defines a variation of Asakura's &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic Hodge cohomology and uses this to construct an infinite&lt;br/&gt;sequence of cohomology theories which conjecturely give a better &lt;br/&gt;and better approximation to motivic cohomology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator's research involves a mixture of algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry and algebraic topology. Algebraic geometry is the study &lt;br/&gt;of solutions of equations using both algebra and geometry. For &lt;br/&gt;example, one can study a circle by examining its equation, or by &lt;br/&gt;looking at its geometric properties. Algebraic topology studies &lt;br/&gt;spaces by attaching algebraic invariants to them, invariants which &lt;br/&gt;can often be computed explicitly. The investigator takes methods &lt;br/&gt;and constructions in algebraic topology, and then modifies and &lt;br/&gt;refines them so that they can be used to define algebraic versions &lt;br/&gt;of the topological invariants. These new algebraic invariants are &lt;br/&gt;then applicable for studying subtle properties of solutions of &lt;br/&gt;equations.</AbstractNarration>
