    <AbstractNarration>The Undergraduate Research Experience in Phylogenetic Approaches to&lt;br/&gt;Biological Problems will allow undergraduates to participate for ten weeks&lt;br/&gt;during each of the summers of 2002-04. Research projects will span diverse&lt;br/&gt;areas of biology from phycology, molecular evolution, behavioral ecology and&lt;br/&gt;microbial diversity but will all have a common phylogenetic perspective.&lt;br/&gt;Ten highly qualified undergraduates will be selected for each summer's&lt;br/&gt;program from local and national institutions with attention paid to&lt;br/&gt;recruiting from underrepresented groups. The main objectives of this&lt;br/&gt;program are to 1) train students in basic methods of molecular biology and&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics , 2) provide a mentored research experience using these&lt;br/&gt;techniques, 3) educate students about the diversity of problems to be&lt;br/&gt;understood with such techniques, and 4) raise awareness of research career&lt;br/&gt;opportunities. These objectives will be attained by a combination of&lt;br/&gt;tutorials in theory and techniques common to all of the projects of the&lt;br/&gt;program, mentored research by individual faculty, a seminar program&lt;br/&gt;delivered by visiting specialists, and career advising by local staff and&lt;br/&gt;former alumni of the program. The program will culminate in a day-long&lt;br/&gt;research symposium presented by the participants. The long-term goals of&lt;br/&gt;the experience are increased awareness of and competitiveness for careers in&lt;br/&gt;research and/or university-level teaching.</AbstractNarration>
