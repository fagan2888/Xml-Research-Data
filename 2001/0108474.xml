    <AbstractNarration>CONSEQUENCES OF COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND NUTRIENT SUPPLY RATE &lt;br/&gt;FOR DYNAMIC RESPONSES TO PERTURBATION: THEORY AND EXPERIMENTS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to accurately predict how ecological systems respond to perturbation is a major goal of ecology. Although ecologists have developed a rich body of theory regarding which properties of ecological systems might be reliable predictors of dynamics following perturbation, there are two major gaps in this theory. First, there have been relatively few experimental tests of theoretical expectations, despite the applied importance of such tests. Second, most studies have focused on "removal" perturbations that involve loss of accumulated biomass, such as hurricanes that knock down trees and stream scouring events that remove biota. However, many ecosystems are also subjected to "addition" perturbations such as nutrient pulses. An important question, therefore, is whether theory developed for removal perturbations is also applicable to addition perturbations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project addresses both needs through field experiments and simulation modeling. The experiments will test theoretical predictions in freshwater plankton communities, whereas modeling studies will determine if current theory applies to nutrient pulses. Together, these studies will result in a more broadly based theory for how ecosystems respond to perturbations, increased understanding of the short-term responses of algae to nutrient pulses, and an evaluation of the possible indirect effects of common lake management practices on algal dynamics.</AbstractNarration>
