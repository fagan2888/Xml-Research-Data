    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Development of alternative clustering methods for genomic expression analysis and characterization of coregulated genes in yeast." This project is developing fuzzy k-means clustering for analysis of genomic expression data, with the goal of identifying coregulated yeast genes that are not identified by traditional methods. After identifying sets of coregulated genes, multiple algorithms will be applied to identify sequence motifs that contribute to the regulation of expression.</AbstractNarration>
