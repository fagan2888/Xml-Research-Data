    <AbstractNarration>0107120 Goldfinger&lt;br/&gt;0107093 Nelson&lt;br/&gt;Great earthquakes represent large releases of energy and the ability to predict them is of obvious importance. A number of models of earthquake temporal and spatial characteristics have been developed, but have not been adequately tested and validated, mostly because the historical record is very short in comparison to the typical time between earthquakes. This project will attempt to provide a record of large earthquakes along the Cascadia margin that spans at least 10,000 years by use of turbidites as proxies for large earthquakes. The results will be invaluable in testing earthquake recurrence models.</AbstractNarration>
