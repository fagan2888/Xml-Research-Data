    <AbstractNarration>A problem common to many disparate fields of scientific and industrial enquiry is&lt;br/&gt;that of comparing a set of experimental conditions, or `treatments', when faced with&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity in the units of material on which the experiment is to be performed. The&lt;br/&gt;technique of blocking specifically addresses this problem. Typically using values of some&lt;br/&gt;identifiable nuisance factor, the experimental units are partitioned into homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;subsets called blocks. Inferences can then be based on the more precise comparisons of&lt;br/&gt;measurements from the same block. The design problem is to determine which treat-&lt;br/&gt;ments are assigned to which units in which blocks, said assignment being driven by&lt;br/&gt;the desire to maximize the quality of information that will ultimately be produced.&lt;br/&gt;The problem becomes more complicated as more nuisance factors, with various inter-&lt;br/&gt;relationships, are introduced or identified. This project addresses the design problem&lt;br/&gt;for a variety of commonly encountered experimental settings, with two broad goals:&lt;br/&gt;(i) to extend the known theory for determining optimal designs for a wider range of&lt;br/&gt;settings than is now known or available; and (ii) to produce a comprehensive catalog&lt;br/&gt;of designs to be incorporated into a larger, web-based resource that will include a vari-&lt;br/&gt;ety of downloadable combinatorial designs useful for statisticians, mathematicians, and&lt;br/&gt;other scientists in academia and industry. By collecting optimal designs in a single,&lt;br/&gt;easily accessible resource, the use of good designs can be increased and the practice of&lt;br/&gt;experimental science consequently sharpened.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When comparing v treatments, the most commonly encountered situation across a&lt;br/&gt;range of scientific endeavors is that of a single blocking variable partitioning bk experi-&lt;br/&gt;mental units into b blocks of k units each. This project will examine optimality problems&lt;br/&gt;for these simple block designs, and the attendant combinatorial issues, augmenting the-&lt;br/&gt;ory by computation where needed, to produce designs for a practical range of parameter&lt;br/&gt;combinations (v; b; k), including settings where equireplication is not possible. The most&lt;br/&gt;frequently used designs with two blocking factors are row-column designs, in which two&lt;br/&gt;blocking factors can be visualized as row and columns in a rectangular array, and re-&lt;br/&gt;solvable designs, in which a second blocking factor partitions a simple block design into&lt;br/&gt;subsets of blocks each consisting of a single replicate. This project will also address&lt;br/&gt;problems in optimality and construction of designs in both these classes, with special&lt;br/&gt;emphasis on plans most demanded in practice: those with few replicates.</AbstractNarration>
