    <AbstractNarration>CCR-0137766 &lt;br/&gt;Alexander Wolf &lt;br/&gt;Association for Computing Machinery&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Impact Project will identify and document research contributions that have had substantial impact, determine the research modalities that have been successful, identify technology transition approaches that have worked best, and anticipate directions that software engineering research might most effectively pursue, based on its history and positioning. Funding will support travel costs for a series of meetings to plan, discuss, and execute the studies. As a special initiative partially funded by the ACM Special Interest Group in Software Engineering (SIGSOFT), the project seeks to be highly inclusive, involving a large number of members of the software engineering community, as well as others whose interests overlap with software engineering. The project's outputs will be a series of documents and briefings, including scholarly, reports. Project results should be useful to the software engineering research and practitioner communities, to other academic disciplines, to government funding agencies, and to the public by helping objectively assess the software engineering community's record of achievement.</AbstractNarration>
