    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is implementing online homework for lower division mathematics courses (Intermediate and College Algebra, College Mathematics, Finite Mathematics, Precalculus, Business Math I &amp; II, and Brief Calculus) using WeBWork, a program developed at the University of Rochester. These courses service on average over 6500 students each semester. The primary objective of instituting online homework is to increase student learning in these courses. Additionally, student attitudes about their introductory mathematics courses are being improved by use of this system and by giving students an initial exposure to technology in their college education. To implement WeBWork, the project is developing libraries of problems for courses and training instructional personnel to use the system and to produce their own problems. A distinctive feature of the problem libraries is the inclusion of more extensive feedback for students when compared with most existing WeBWork problems. Dissemination is taking place through local workshops held for other educators and conference presentations. Assessment of student performance and attitudes is integrated into the entire project.</AbstractNarration>
