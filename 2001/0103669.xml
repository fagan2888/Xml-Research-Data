    <AbstractNarration>Research on Stochastic Optimization and Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hui Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many stochastic optimization problems assume that the decision &lt;br/&gt;maker has the total freedom to intervene the system. That is, &lt;br/&gt;the control policies can be adjusted continuously and &lt;br/&gt;instantaneously, or the state processes can be stopped arbitrarily &lt;br/&gt;within some time interval. However, this assumption is often &lt;br/&gt;violated in practice. The first part of the project is concerned&lt;br/&gt;with some new formulations for stochastic optimization problems &lt;br/&gt;in order to accommodate these practical constraints. These models &lt;br/&gt;share a common feature: random intervention times determined by &lt;br/&gt;exogenous signal processes. In the context of optimal control, &lt;br/&gt;the decision maker is allowed to adjust the level of control &lt;br/&gt;only at times when an exogenous process gives him a green light; &lt;br/&gt;for example, when an Poisson process makes a jump. In the area of &lt;br/&gt;optimal stopping, the state process is allowed to be stopped only &lt;br/&gt;at times when it receives certain signals from an exogenous process. &lt;br/&gt;Both formulations admit explicit solutions and can be applied to &lt;br/&gt;model practical constraints on control policies or stopping times. &lt;br/&gt;The second part of the project is concerned with a class of diffusion &lt;br/&gt;processes with jumps. The major effort is put on their applications &lt;br/&gt;to economics and finance. The reason for the introduction of such &lt;br/&gt;processes is that the classical diffusion model for stock prices &lt;br/&gt;cannot explain many empirical puzzles. For example, an abnormality &lt;br/&gt;called volatility smile is often observed in option pricing, and the &lt;br/&gt;return distributions of financial assets exhibit a leptokurtic feature. &lt;br/&gt;We intend to explain these phenomena, using the jump processes to model &lt;br/&gt;stock prices in a financial market or the values of economic projects &lt;br/&gt;in investment problems. The discontinuous behavior in the underlying &lt;br/&gt;processes requires new techniques to obtain explicit solutions to &lt;br/&gt;certain pricing and wealth optimization problems. The research project &lt;br/&gt;includes pricing commonly traded exotic options, analysis of utility&lt;br/&gt;maximization, and evaluation of investment projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic optimization is one of the main topics in modern applied &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, with many applications in disciplines like engineering, &lt;br/&gt;biology, economics and finance, etc. The purpose of this research &lt;br/&gt;project is to systematically develop mathematical theories that are &lt;br/&gt;more faithful to real life problems, so that the conclusions drawn &lt;br/&gt;from them can be used with more confidence. For example, a better &lt;br/&gt;understanding for the uncertainty of stock prices can help agents &lt;br/&gt;reduce the risk in financial practice. However, in developing more &lt;br/&gt;realistic models, one must be aware of the subtle balance between &lt;br/&gt;complexity and mathematical tractability. A realistic yet too &lt;br/&gt;complicated model can be mathematically untractable. The goal of &lt;br/&gt;the project, therefore, is to develop analytically or numerically &lt;br/&gt;solvable models that embrace the essence of the practical problems. &lt;br/&gt;To this end, some new formulations are considered for general &lt;br/&gt;stochastic optimization problems in order to accommodate some &lt;br/&gt;practical constraints; for example, the controller can intervene &lt;br/&gt;the system only at times when an exogenous process sends out a &lt;br/&gt;certain signal. Also considered are some new models for &lt;br/&gt;economics and finance that incorporate the drastic changes of &lt;br/&gt;stock prices over short periods of time. These new models can be &lt;br/&gt;used to explain many empirical puzzles that the classical models &lt;br/&gt;fail to do, and to help agents develop better portfolios to reduce risk.</AbstractNarration>
