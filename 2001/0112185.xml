    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the IGBP is to improve understanding of the interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the Earth system; the unique environment that it provides for life; the changes that are occurring in this system; and the manner in which they are influenced by, and in turn influence, human actions. The IGBP scientific program, which was implemented initially around eight "core projects" addressing specific multi-disciplinary aspects of the Earth system, is being restructured into a more concise and integrated structure reflecting the dynamics of the Earth system, with broad activities organized around main components of the system-atmosphere, ocean and land-and, equally importantly, at the interfaces between these components. Two overarching and integrating activities-the Global Analysis, Integration and Modeling program (GAIM) and the Study of Past Global Changes (PAGES) - will address the Earth system as a whole. This new focus on the Earth system will also address issues of major societal importance which link strongly to changes in Earth system dynamics, particularly global sustainability, e.g., cross-cutting research on (i) the global carbon cycle, (ii) food and fiber production, and (iii) water resources. The new focus for the IGBP will be developed in large part through the IGBP Open Science Conference, which will present the latest results of global change research at a series of levels: research conducted throught the individual IGBP core projects and research integrated across these projects; research that has been integrated between the IGBP and the WCRP, the IHDP, Diversitas, the Global Change System for Analysis, Research and Training(START), other regional programs, and individual research projects on which these integrated efforts are based. The Conference will also identify new approaches to study of the complex planetary system in which human activities are closely linked with natural processes. The IGBP's Scientific Committee, its IGBP's Officers, and its Secretariat will lead planning for the IGBP's scientific agenda; promote initiation, oversee and keep under review implementation of the program; foster archiving and exchange of collected data and scientific results; develop standards for measurements and data analysis; lead integration and synthesis of the research into a coherent and comprehensive global picture; avoid duplication of effort and resource use; and communicate research results and data to a number of audiences.</AbstractNarration>
