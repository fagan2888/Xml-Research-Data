    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: Model-Based Design and Verification of Embedded Systems&lt;br/&gt;Radu Grosu&lt;br/&gt;State University of New York at Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer aided verification (CAV) and embedded software design automation (ESDA) emerge from&lt;br/&gt;academia and industry respectively as two promising approaches to developing the high-confidence&lt;br/&gt;software demanded by embedded-system applications, including those found in the telecommunications,&lt;br/&gt;aerospace/military, medical-device, and automotive industries. CAV and ESDA advocate the same&lt;br/&gt;methodology for system design: (1) define the requirements, (2) construct a model and (3) analyze&lt;br/&gt;the model with respect to the requirements. The difference is essentially that: (1) CAV uses more&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated requirements, (2) ESDA uses more sophisticated models and (3) CAV performs a more&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated analysis. While ESDA analysis reduces to manual, pointwise simulation of the model,&lt;br/&gt;CAV analysis is automatic and exhaustive. This is made possible by a mathematical formulation of&lt;br/&gt;the requirements, models and analysis problem that is far beyond the precision currently supported&lt;br/&gt;by ESDA. The goal of this research is to: (1) push the limits of CAV to capture and analyze&lt;br/&gt;ESDA models; (2) increase the confidence in ESDA by applying CAV techniques. This goal is pursued&lt;br/&gt;with following research and education objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Support the design methodology for discrete, time-triggered and event-triggered embedded&lt;br/&gt;systems with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Hierarchic reactive modules (HRM), a state-based modeling language that supports&lt;br/&gt; architectural and behavioral hierarchy together with powerful time and space abstraction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Concurrent class machines (CCM), an action-based modeling language that directly&lt;br/&gt; incorporates object-oriented features like classes and inheritance, objects and object creation,&lt;br/&gt; methods, method invocation and exceptions, threads and thread creation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Shared variables interaction diagrams, a scenario-based language that adequately&lt;br/&gt; captures requirements of embedded systems communicating via shared variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Hermes}, a modeling, simulation and model checking tool for HRM that efficiently&lt;br/&gt; exploits the hierarchical structure to prune the state space. We also consider a variety of&lt;br/&gt; other CAV techniques and support for CCM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Support the design methodology for embedded systems with tightly coupled discrete and analog&lt;br/&gt; behavior with:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Hierarchic hybrid machines (HHM)}, a hierarchic, state-based modeling language that&lt;br/&gt; allows to capture both discrete and analog behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Charon, a modeling and simulation tool for HHM that exploits hierarchic structure for&lt;br/&gt; efficient multi-rate integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; - Different approaches to simulation, reachability analysis and modular reasoning.&lt;br/&gt; Application of hybrid systems to modeling cell behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Publish a textbook providing a comprehensive, formal treatment of the unified modeling&lt;br/&gt; language UML for Real Time to reduce the gap between ESDA and CAV.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Integrate formal concepts in the undergraduate education at Stony-Brook by proposing changes&lt;br/&gt; for the courses in software engineering, theory of computation and operating systems.</AbstractNarration>
