    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is permitting the introduction of GC/MS in an incremental fashion into the curriculum as students are using this instrument in undergraduate organic chemistry, quantitative analysis, instrumental methods of analysis, advanced synthetic laboratories, and undergraduate research. Through a careful selection of instrument components, the incremental approach is allowing the use of the GC/MS in both large enrollment lower-division and lower enrollment upper-division laboratories. Experiments are being adapted from the research and the educational literature and implemented into our curriculum using an inquiry-based pedagogy. The incremental approach begins with the concepts needed to interpret isotopic mass and abundance data, and then continues with fragmentation patterns of complex species, techniques required for the accurate analysis of complex mixtures, and identifications through the use of library software. Finally, a sound introduction to the operating principles of GC/MS is providing the foundation for sophisticated uses in our upper-division instrumental methods of analysis and advanced synthesis courses and in undergraduate research projects. This approach is developing the student's comprehension of and appreciation for the power of this technique through a variety of experiences. The creative thinking skills and problem solving abilities of students are being improved. The installation of the GC/MS is a continuation of our overall Laboratory Modernization/Technology Integration Effort.</AbstractNarration>
