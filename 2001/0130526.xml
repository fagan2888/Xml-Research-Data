    <AbstractNarration>Proposal ID: 0130526&lt;br/&gt;Title: Berkeley Statistics VIGRE Project&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Rice&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California - Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Berkeley Statistics Department will operate a vertically integrated research and education program involving undergraduate majors, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the program is to produce statistically trained professionals who will contribute to our society in the commercial, governmental, and academic sectors. The program contains several integrated components. Innovations at the undergraduate level include curriculum reform, research seminars, and research experiences for undergraduates. The graduate student component includes education, mentored teaching experiences, research, and broadening components aimed at training graduate students to interact in interdisciplinary environments. The postdoctoral component includes mentored research and teaching experiences. Recruitment of traditionally under-represented groups into these programs will be strengthened by the resources of the Berkeley Edge, a campus NSF-Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate, the goal of which is to triple minority Ph.D. production in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
