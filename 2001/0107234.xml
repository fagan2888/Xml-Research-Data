    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for CoFE 2001 conference that will focus on identifying food engineering priorities for the 21st century and on integrating this field with other major engineering disciplines and promoting interaction among engineers from various engineering discipline areas. The Conference is designed to help guide future research priorities and is organized around the major topical tracks including: (1) physical chemistry of foods, (2) transport processes, (3) food processing and packaging, (4) food engineering education, and (5) university and industry interaction. This Conference will provide a forum for consideration of future research directions of food process engineering in critical need, especially those research challenges emerging from the food industry. This Conference will be the 8th one of its series. It will be a topical conference within the annual meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) to be held in Reno, Nevada during November 5 - 9, 2001. The organizing committee plans to submit a final report of the Conference to the National Science Foundation soon after the Conference.</AbstractNarration>
