    <AbstractNarration>Investigations in theoretical high energy physics in areas of supersymmetry phenomenology, CP violation, dark matter and extra dimensions and their applications to model building will be carried out. The implications of the data from the Brookhaven g-2 experiment and of RUNII of the Tevatron for supersymmetry and surperstring theory will be explored. Correlated studies of nonuniversalities, flavor and&lt;br/&gt;CP violation in grand unified and string models will be carried out with the goal of achieving correlated predictions for the electric dipole moments of leptons and of flavor violating processes. This investigation&lt;br/&gt; is of importance in view of the proposed experiments for the sensitive search of the muon electric dipole moment and of the process mu-e+gamma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studies of the amount of supersymmetric dark matter in the coannihilation region including effects of nonuniversalities will be carried out. Further, studies of dark matter under the influence of CP violation&lt;br/&gt;will also be carrried out in the coannihilation region. Additional research will include investigations of new grand unified models which can remove the current constraint on such models brought about by the recent SuperKamiokande limit on the p-nubar+K mode. Such models include grand unified models with large representations and models in extra dimensions. Specifically the possible deduction of supergravity GUTs&lt;br/&gt;with a cascade from higher dimensional supergravity theories to lower dimensional ones along with supersymmetry breaking related to extra dimensions will be investigated.</AbstractNarration>
