Up to five Fellows for 2001-2002 year will be selected and placed in offices throughout NSF, working on projects of mutual interest to the Fellows and the host directorate or office. Fellows will learn how NSF funds science, while providing scientific, engineering and educational input on issues relating to NSF's mission support of fundamental science and engineering research and education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fellows will work with staff involved in planning, development and oversight of agency programs in all fields of fundamental research. Assignments may involve significant interagency, congressional or international activity, as well as involvement with the National Science Board, NSF's policy-setting body. The program includes an orientation on executive branch and congressional operations, as well as a yearlong seminar program on issues involving science, technology and public policy. The fellowships potentially are renewable for a second year.</AbstractNarration>
