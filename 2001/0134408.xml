    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0134408&lt;br/&gt;Robert W. Ghrist&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The efficacy of topological methods in contemporary applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics is primarily attributable to the fact that topological&lt;br/&gt;features of a system are inherently robust and global. This &lt;br/&gt;project focuses on a technology transfer from contemporary ideas &lt;br/&gt;in topology, geometry, and dynamics to bear upon application &lt;br/&gt;domains which include the following: First, Robotics: tools &lt;br/&gt;from configuration space theory, CAT(0)complexes, and &lt;br/&gt;computational topology will be directed toward specific &lt;br/&gt;problems in reconfigurable robotics, sensor-based navigation &lt;br/&gt;of mobile agents, and self-assembly systems. Second, Parabolic &lt;br/&gt;coupled systems: a Morse-theoretic homotopy index for braids &lt;br/&gt;will be used to solve parabolic variational problems arising in pattern-formation PDE's, discrete Lagrangian mechanics, and &lt;br/&gt;coupled oscillators. A Floer-theoretic extension of the braid &lt;br/&gt;index will also be developed for infinite dimensional systems. &lt;br/&gt;Third, Hydrodynamics: tools from contact geometry and topology &lt;br/&gt;will be directed toward solving global problems of the dynamics &lt;br/&gt;and stability of Eulerian fluid flows in dimensions higher &lt;br/&gt;than two. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most systems of interest in science and engineering, &lt;br/&gt;multiple cooperative tasks must be globally coordinated. &lt;br/&gt;A common thread is that whether the tasks involve &lt;br/&gt;macro-scale robots, micro-scale devices, coupled oscillators, &lt;br/&gt;or fluid particles, there is an abstract space of configurations&lt;br/&gt;lurking behind the physical phenomena. Unearthing and &lt;br/&gt;examining those properties of physically-motivated &lt;br/&gt;configuration spaces which capture the global features, the &lt;br/&gt;topology, geometry, and dynamics, holds the promise of &lt;br/&gt;providing global tools which transcend the physical &lt;br/&gt;instantiation of the system at hand: ostensibly different &lt;br/&gt;systems possess similar topological underpinnings. &lt;br/&gt;The research component of this project is the development &lt;br/&gt;of contemporary topological and global-geometric techniques &lt;br/&gt;for analyzing the dynamics and coordination of systems of &lt;br/&gt;interest in engineering and computer science. The overall &lt;br/&gt;goal is an effective technology transfer from cutting-edge &lt;br/&gt;perspectives in topology to bear upon systems in application &lt;br/&gt;domains which include robotics, mechanics, and fluid dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;This is combined with a blend of pedagogical service across &lt;br/&gt;graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels, featuring &lt;br/&gt;a focused research group on topological robotics and a &lt;br/&gt;high-school outreach program of expository lectures on the &lt;br/&gt;relevance and joy of mathematical research.</AbstractNarration>
