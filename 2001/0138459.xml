    <AbstractNarration>0138459&lt;br/&gt;Lazzarini &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports a US-India cooperative research project entitled Extracting Gravitational Wave Signals of Inspiraling Compact Binary Stars from Laser Interferometric Data. US PIs Albert Lazzarini, California Institute of Technology and Lee Finn, Pennsylvania State University will collaborate with Sanjeev Dhurandhar and two young scientists from his group at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. The aim of the research is to advance gravitational wave physics by raising the efficiency and probability of detecting gravitational waves. The first task is to devise computationally efficient signal extraction techniques for detecting inspiraling binary signals; the second is to increase the likelihood of wave detection by analyzing how these signals can be identified using a network of detectors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The Indian collaborators have complementary skills and the expertise to ensure a successful collaboration. Theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and simulations are the vital components from their side. Professor Dhurandhar and the IUCAA group, which he heads, is internationally recognized for theoretical work on extraction of inspiraling binary signals from detector data. The participation of two young scientists from India has the potential to be a valuable contribution to the US effort in gravitational wave detection. The US PIs are leading researchers in this field. The newly established Center for Gravitational Physics (CGWP) is dedicated to the physics and phenomenology of gravitational wave astrophysics and funded under the Physics Frontier Center Program. The CGWP will host the visits of the Indian researchers.</AbstractNarration>
