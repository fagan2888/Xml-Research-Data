    <AbstractNarration>Purchase College, State University of New York (SUNY) is unlike many institutions of higher education in the U.S. because it has outstanding Mathematics/Computer Science and New Media technology undergraduate research programs that serve a combined total of 60% economically disadvantaged students, 30% minority students, 29% women, and 5% disabled. These programs successfully place graduates in the high technology workforce or graduate school. They also maintain strong partnerships with other local colleges and high technology industry. Due to these strengths, Purchase has established a consortium with Dutchess Community College (DCC), Orange County Community College (OCCC), Rockland Community College (RCC), Westchester Community College (WCC), IBM, Modem Media, and seven successful Purchase programs that serve economically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students. The Consortium, with Purchase as its leader, is developing and implementing a Mathematics, Computer Science and Technology Pipeline Scholarship Program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of the Program are:&lt;br/&gt;1. To recruit 30 academically talented, economically disadvantaged, underrepresented minority, women, and disabled students into AA, AS, AAS, and BA degree programs in mathematics, computer science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;2. To provide research opportunities and academic and financial support for 100% of program participants to increase their retention to degree achievement.&lt;br/&gt;3. To assist 100% of degree recipients with job/graduate school placement in the fields of mathematics, computer science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;4. To increase collaborative arrangements among associate and baccalaureate degree-granting institutions and the local high technology industry.&lt;br/&gt;5. To assess, document, and disseminate the effectiveness of 100% of the proposed activities implemented through this model Pipeline Scholarship Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Program will be managed by Principle Investigator (PI) Dr. Peter Ohring, in cooperation with six Co-PIs and a Steering Committee consisting of representatives from each of the five Consortium institutions and local high technology industry. The PI will oversee publicity, student recruitment and selection, monitoring of student progress, financial administration, and Program assessment. The Co-PIs will coordinate student support programs and services. Concluding the four-year grant cycle, a total of 120 students will receive AA, AS, AAS, or BA degrees, and be placed in the mathematics, computer science, and technology workforce or graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
