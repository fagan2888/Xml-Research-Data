    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0109079&lt;br/&gt;D. D. Joseph, University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort is a GOALI association between the University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;Fluid Dynamics Lab and the oil-industry supported laboratory STIMLAB from Duncan, Oklahoma. It is an attempt to explore the application of the direct numerical simulation technique to slurry transport and also to proppant transport in reservoir fractures. In both cases, the emphasis will be to identify the force interaction between the particles and the ambient liquid. Also, numerical flow field calculations will be fitted to experimental results with the help of relevant non-dimensional power law parameters. This "method of correlations" should reveal self-similar properties not immediately apparent from the traditional conservation equations of fluid dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;The PI presents an extensive evaluation of the progress he has already accomplished in that direction, in part with NSF support. Many results have been obtained for a variety of applications, from the simple (Poiseuille flow) to the very applied (foaming bubble columns, bitumen froth transport...). Several finite element codes have been evolved (ALE, DLM), and successful correlations (some of them by other groups) are presented. Out of this abundance of results, the PI has produced a number of proposed research extensions into interdependent properties: particle life off, circulation, bifurcation, and levitation to equilibrium. A partial outline of the correlations which the PI intends to investigate is given, as well as a short statement of the more applied kind of problems where STIMLAB could use its abundant data bank: proppant transport, collision models.</AbstractNarration>
