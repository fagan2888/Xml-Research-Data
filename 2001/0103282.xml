    <AbstractNarration>Complex Manifolds with special Structures, Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; author: Zhuang-dan Guan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;My research has been largely in the area of complex manifolds and have a &lt;br/&gt;number of problems to work on. Recently, I am working on three major &lt;br/&gt;directions: (1) Classification of compact hyperkahler manifolds, (2) &lt;br/&gt;Stability and extremal metrics, (3) Classification of Complex homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;spaces. Our research was highly concentrated on these directions for the last &lt;br/&gt;4 to 5 years. We expect to work on extremal metrics and hyperkahler manifolds&lt;br/&gt;for some other years since many breakthroughs are happenning in these &lt;br/&gt;directions. The picture for extremal metrics is becoming clear after many &lt;br/&gt;years of research. It can be described by the geodesic stability principles. &lt;br/&gt;The uniqueness comes from the convex property of the modified Mabuchi &lt;br/&gt;functional on Mabuchi moduli space of Kahler metrics and the existence of &lt;br/&gt;geodesics between Kahler metrics [GM4]. The existence should be the same as &lt;br/&gt;the geodesic stability [GM7]. I already test these principles by both the &lt;br/&gt;examples in my dissertation and those in [GM7]. For the toric manifolds, we &lt;br/&gt;already proved the uniqueness and that existence implies the geodesic &lt;br/&gt;stability. We are trying to solve the final part of the geodesic stability &lt;br/&gt;principles that geodesic stable implies existence for toric manifolds. We also &lt;br/&gt;test the geodesic stability for many toric manifolds, e. g., the manifold &lt;br/&gt;obtained by blowing up two points in a 2 dimensional complex projective space.&lt;br/&gt;This will eventually solve the historical problem of existing Kahler-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;metrics and extremal metrics. The best condidates of Hodge diamonds for the &lt;br/&gt;complex 4 dimensional compact hyperkahler manifolds are described by the &lt;br/&gt;possible pairs of the second and third Betti numbers (5,36),(7,8),(8,0),(23,0)&lt;br/&gt;([GHS4]). Now it is the time to work on classification with many tools as &lt;br/&gt;Lagrangian fibration, Rozansky-Witten invariants, geometric elliptic genera. A&lt;br/&gt;sandwich inequality of Rozansky-Witten invariants suggests further results for &lt;br/&gt;higher dimensional case. The classification of compact complex homogeneous &lt;br/&gt;spaces is reduced to the better understood manifolds as parallelizable &lt;br/&gt;manifolds, reductive spaces and primary spaces in [GH7]. We will try to &lt;br/&gt;understand more about the higher step primary spaces in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of Kahler-Einstein metric has been pioneered by many well-known &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians including several Fields Medal receivers. It turns out that&lt;br/&gt;there are many similarity between this field and the Hitchin-Kobayashi&lt;br/&gt;correspondence in the holomorphic vector bundles on compact Kahler manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;Both fields are closed related to Physics Science, e.g., Einstein equation,&lt;br/&gt;general relativity, Yang-Mills, Mirror Symmetry, Calabi-Yau, etc. We will &lt;br/&gt;write up a textbook in Kahler geometry describe a clear picture on both of &lt;br/&gt;these fields. Hyperkahler manifolds and homogeneous manifolds are some &lt;br/&gt;important manifolds which have some physics origin as that of Calabi-Yau &lt;br/&gt;manifolds and are unsolved classical topics in complex geometry. The pictures &lt;br/&gt;for these fields become clearer recently.</AbstractNarration>
