    <AbstractNarration>0122759&lt;br/&gt;Abruna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year award for US-Spain collaboration on enzyme immobilization methodologies giving rise to oriented layers of enzymes leading to amperometric biosensor applications involves Hector Abruna and students at Cornell University and Encarnacion Lorenzo at the Universidad Autonoma of Madrid in Spain. Enzymes represent some of the most sophisticated catalysts known. Immobilization of active enzymes onto solid substrates can be used to generate sensors that exploit these features. Immobilization approaches tend to alter, if not destroy, an enzyme's activity, there is interest in new enzyme immobilization methodologies that will allow for the oriented immobilization of the enzyme layer while retaining enzymatic activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US researchers bring to this collaboration expertise in electrochemical techniques and in the synthesis and characterization of transition metal complexes. This is complemented by Spanish expertise in the preparation and characterization of a variety of sensors and in their application to the analysis of pesticides in foods and in environmental samples. This work, coupling diverse aspects of chemistry and biology, will be of interest and utility in environmental studies and monitoring of pollutants and in biotechnological applications.</AbstractNarration>
