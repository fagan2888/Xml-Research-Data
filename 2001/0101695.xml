    <AbstractNarration>Los Angeles County, the largest urban manufacturing area in the United States, currently has a labor crisis in durable manufacturing that threatens to inhibit the growth of the local economy. At a time when the metal manufacturing industry is experiencing a growing demand for skilled employees, industrial and technical education in the state is in crisis due to lack of qualified instructors and support from districts. Well-educated machinists are critical to the continued success of manufacturing in the region. To address these issues, Los Angeles Trade-Technical College and the Small Manufacturers' Association in collaboration with the National Institute for Metalworking Skills are in the planning stages of establishing a Regional Center for Manufacturing Education with the goal of developing a model for the systemic reform of industrial education. Validating skills through nationally accepted standards is at the core of the mission and is facilitating articulation along a career pathway to stimulate the development of a well educated workforce. The ultimate goal is to support the growth of durable manufacturing in the southern California region.</AbstractNarration>
