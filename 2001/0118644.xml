    <AbstractNarration>The rapidly emerging areas of nanoscale science and technology are focussed on the design, fabrication, and characterization of functional objects having dimensions at the nanometer length scale. New advances in this emerging area are expected to have long range implications in a wide variety of different scientific and engineering disciplines. The importance of nanoscale science is growing worldwide and it is now widely recognized as a critical component to the future growth of the US economy. The U.S. National Science and Technology Council has identified this area as a major contributor to the 21st Century science and technology workforce. As a consequence, former President Clinton has made the National Nanotechnology Initiative a top priority within US funding agencies. In response to the growing awareness of the importance of nantechnology, many conferences are being organized worldwide to discuss the latest advances. A travel grant is requested to allow approximately 12 US scientists plus 10 US graduate students to participate and attend an important international event, the annual Trends in Nanotechnology 2001 Conference (TNT200I) - one of the premier European conferences devoted to nanoscale science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
