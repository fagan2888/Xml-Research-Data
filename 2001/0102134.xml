    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. Biomedical and chemical researchers routinely employ liquid scintillation counting as a means of quantifying the amount of radioactivity emitted by beta-particle emitting isotopes (e.g., 3H and 14C) in samples generated during experiments. Frequently, these samples are aqueous in nature and must be mixed with an organic solvent containing dissolved fluor molecules (scintillators) to form an emulsion-based "cocktail". Although efficient, the disposal of the large quantities of "mixed" (radioactive and organic) waste generated by liquid scintillation counting presents an economical and environmental challenge. To solve this problem, the PI proposes to develop an aqueous-based scintillation system by applying nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the 12-month project is to develop an aqueous-based NanoScintillation system that may serve as an alternative to organic solvent-based liquid scintillation cocktails. Two specific aims proposed are: 1) to demonstrate that a primary fluor molecule can be entrapped in an engineered aqueous-based NanoScintillation System meeting the following criteria: system consists of &gt;98% water, no organic solvents, and permanently suspended particles &lt;100 nm, and 2) to demonstrate that the engineered NanoScintillation System has detection efficiencies for 3H and 14C that are &gt;50% of those of commercial organic solvent-based liquid scintillation cocktails. Two types of stable oil-in-water microemulsions as nanotemplates for the curing of solid nanoparticles containing fluor molecules will be engineered. Particle size, stability, and suspendability of the engineered nanoparticles will be measured as a criteria for an optimal NanoScintillation System. The detection efficiency of optimal systems for 3H and 14C will be determined and compared to those of commercially available organic-solvent based cocktail systems.</AbstractNarration>
