    <AbstractNarration>Proposal No: 0113515&lt;br/&gt;ITR/SY: A Flexible Framework for Secure Information Sharing Among Collaborating Organizations&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jajodia Sushil&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to develop a exible framework for secure information &lt;br/&gt;sharing among collaborating organizations. The approach will be to extend the Flexible &lt;br/&gt;Authorization Framework (FAF) designed by the PI and his colleagues. FAF is based on an &lt;br/&gt;authorization specication language that has rule based syntax and sound, non-monotonic logic based &lt;br/&gt;semantics. The rst goal of this proposal is to enhance FAF to include information ow &lt;br/&gt;controls, provisional authorizations, delegation of authority, and a rather broad sense of &lt;br/&gt;revocation capabilities of granted permissions. The second undertaking is to investigate ecient &lt;br/&gt;implementation of the resulting framework that is based on the best practices of the security &lt;br/&gt;community. The third goal of this proposal is to investigate the properties of basic constructs &lt;br/&gt;that are used to compose security policies.&lt;br/&gt;The main deliverables of this proposal are a reference architecture, &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and algorithms for security specications of information access and ow, their ecient &lt;br/&gt;implementation techniques, and an an algebra for policy compositions.</AbstractNarration>
