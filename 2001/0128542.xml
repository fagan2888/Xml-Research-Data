    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes a new low cost electro- chemical fabrication method to produce flexible photovoltaic cells based on the commercially important copper indium diselenide (CIS) films. The project will develop an innovative n-CIS solar cell with fewer components and processing steps. The cell will be constructed on a flexible foil to reduce weight, fragility and balance-of-system costs. The project also develops a new roll-to-roll electrodeposition technology for large volume manufacturing. Phase I will synthesize CIS films and construct n/p heterojunction devices on metal foils. It will evaluate the solar cell performance to validate the concepts. The proposed n-CIS solar cell configuration and its fabrication are specially designed to simplify manufacturing, reduce costs and increase production speed. It will circumvent the complexity, expense, safety and scale-up issues of the present p-CIS technology. Its commercialization will provide a timely solution to the nation's escalating energy and environmental problems. It will avert future power crises and help reduce global warming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications for the copper indium diselenide technology range from the electric utility to satellites. Flexible, lightweight, photovoltaic cells may be used in non-utility applications such as electric vehicles, building integration, mobile systems and new space systems. Lower costs, fewer components and easier manufacturing could translate into a wider spectrum of commercial markets.</AbstractNarration>
