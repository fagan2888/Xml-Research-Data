    <AbstractNarration>BCS-0123580&lt;br/&gt; PI: Clifton, C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A three-day workshop on "Separability of cognitive functions: What can be learned from Williams Syndrome?" will be held in late August of 2001. The workshop is designed to encourage researchers in the Five Colleges and other colleges in New England the the North East states to engage in research involving young people with Williams syndrome. Its secondary goal is to bring the Berkshire Hills Music Academy facility and its future potential for facilitating research to the attention of the world-wide community of Williams researchers. A third goal is to promote the exchange of ideas among researchers with various kinds of expertise in Williams syndrome. All three goals are directed to the larger objective of understanding the diwssociations among cognitive abilities exhibited by Williams syndrome people and exploring their implications for the basic structure of human cognition and the interconnections among distinct cognitive abilities</AbstractNarration>
