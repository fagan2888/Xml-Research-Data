    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleague study computational&lt;br/&gt;aspects of various geometric problems in two directions: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Design and implementation of efficient algorithms for the&lt;br/&gt;approximation of various convex and nonconvex objects in&lt;br/&gt;multidimensional space by polytopes, and research of the&lt;br/&gt;computational complexity as well as practical efficiency of these&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. (2) Application of high performance computing as a&lt;br/&gt;tool to solve or advance toward a solution of open theoretical&lt;br/&gt;problems in convex geometry, among them, Kneser's problem&lt;br/&gt;concerning the relationship between volumes of intersections or&lt;br/&gt;unions of balls in multidimensional Euclidean space and their&lt;br/&gt;mutual distances. Because of its practical importance in many&lt;br/&gt;application areas, the approximation of both convex and nonconvex&lt;br/&gt;polytopes by "simpler" polytopes is given special attention, and&lt;br/&gt;fully constructive solutions are developed for these cases.&lt;br/&gt;Extensions and variants such as approximation under various&lt;br/&gt;metrics, requiring the approximating object to enclose or be&lt;br/&gt;contained within the approximated object, and finding minimal&lt;br/&gt;enclosing polytopes of a specific type (like parallelotopes, for&lt;br/&gt;example), are also considered. Some of these variants find&lt;br/&gt;important applications in mobile computing and multidimensional&lt;br/&gt;databases.&lt;br/&gt; The investigators develop efficient computational solutions&lt;br/&gt;for the problem of approximating multidimensional bodies by&lt;br/&gt;polytopes (solids formed by flat faces) of a prescribed size.&lt;br/&gt;Such approximation is an important tool in many disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;including molecular modeling, optimal control, computer-aided&lt;br/&gt;design, and computer visualization. They also investigate the&lt;br/&gt;problem of enclosing and approximating multidimensional bodies by&lt;br/&gt;polytopes of a prescribed type, such as "boxes" (parallelotopes),&lt;br/&gt;for example. Solutions to these problems find important&lt;br/&gt;applications in the rapidly growing areas of mobile computing and&lt;br/&gt;multidimensional databases. Furthermore, due to their simplicity,&lt;br/&gt;polytopes are by far the most widely used form of model&lt;br/&gt;representation. Thus, the work is also important because it&lt;br/&gt;facilitates the use of the large body of methods already&lt;br/&gt;available for polytopes, provided that the resulting&lt;br/&gt;approximation is good and can be performed efficiently.&lt;br/&gt;Development of these algorithms produces tools of high&lt;br/&gt;performance computing. The investigators use these tools in turn&lt;br/&gt;to study long-standing geometric problems.</AbstractNarration>
