    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0104089&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the proposal is on the research of locally Hermitian symmetric&lt;br/&gt;spaces of non-compact type, considered as special complex manifolds of &lt;br/&gt;non-positive sectional curvature. Complex hyperbolicity can be considered as &lt;br/&gt;a weak notion of negative curvature. From analytic point of view, the &lt;br/&gt;principal investigator proposes to work on the rigidity of tangent bundles &lt;br/&gt;among the moduli space of vector bundles of locally Hermitian symmetric spaces.&lt;br/&gt;From the uniformization point of view, he proposes to work on characterization of &lt;br/&gt;arithmetic lattices in complex two balls. He proposes to investigate the analogue&lt;br/&gt;of Fijita's conjectures concerning very ampleness of pluricanonical line bundles &lt;br/&gt;on such manifolds, relating to algebraic geometry. He proposes to understand and &lt;br/&gt;estimate the growth of Betti numbers on a tower of coverings naturally associated &lt;br/&gt;with the manifolds, relating topology to geometry. In the direction of number &lt;br/&gt;theory, he proposes to study the question on finiteness of rational points on &lt;br/&gt;models of two ball quotients defined over an algebraic number field. He also &lt;br/&gt;proposes to work on several other problems in the area of complex hyperbolicity&lt;br/&gt;and Kaehler geometry, relating to his earlier research directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In mathematics, people are interested in models which on one hand are elegant &lt;br/&gt;and relatively simple to describe and on the other hand display rich mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structures. Locally Hermitian symmetric spaces are such nice geometric models for&lt;br/&gt;which different disciplines of mathematics meet. The main purpose of this &lt;br/&gt;proposal is to understand several geometric and arithmetic aspects of such models&lt;br/&gt;and explain their interrelationships. Understanding of the various properties&lt;br/&gt;and problems proposed will enhance the knowledge of the subject and other &lt;br/&gt;disciplines of mathematics involved.</AbstractNarration>
