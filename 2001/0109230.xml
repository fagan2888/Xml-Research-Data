    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2001. The goal of the fellowship is to prepare minority scientists for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients. This program is an effort by the NSF to increase the number of research scientists from underrepresented minority groups, thereby contributing to the future vitality of the Nation's scientific enterprise. It is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Understanding the physiological and biochemical effects of increased hydrostatic pressure in seals and sea lions: how can they dive so deep?" The physiological limits to diving in marine mammals focus on two restrictions: how long can the animal breath-hold and how deep can it dive? Within these limits, animals hunt by choosing a foraging strategy that balances the obligate costs with the potential energetic gains of foraging. In order to incorporate a more complete picture of the physiological and biochemical limitations to diving into optimal foraging models for diving mammals, this research is examining red blood cell membrane changes and non-glycolytic pathway responses to increased hydrostatic pressure.</AbstractNarration>
