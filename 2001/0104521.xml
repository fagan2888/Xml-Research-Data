    <AbstractNarration>Considerable progress has been made in recent years in earthquake simulation techniques in geotechnical engineering through, for example, centrifuge modeling, 1g shaking table experiments, and numerical and field simulations. These latest developments significantly enhance the research capabilities in geotechnical earthquake engineering, and generate enormous opportunities as well as great challenges for this research community. These newly-available capabilities significantly expand the types of research that can be conducted. For example, the simulation of large field structures such as earth dams, in-depth field investigations, and closer-to-real-life computer simulations become feasible. At the same time, the significant investment in research facilities combined with the limited funding resources available requires that future research focus on making maximum use of these new capabilities. This workshop will help to facilitate this by bringing together experts from around the world to discuss the capabilities and limitations of the new facilities, to discuss the research topics that can be conducted using these facilities, to develop ideas of collaboration among groups of researchers, to find innovative and effective ways of information dissemination, and to address the unique challenges resulting from the implementation of the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 30 US and international experts will meet in Cleveland, Ohio in July 2001. In addition, a web discussion site will be setup before, and continue after the workshop. It will be accessible not only to the workshop participants, but to all interested researchers, thus allowing non-participants to join in and contribute to the workshop discussions. The workshop proceedings will be posted online for wide dissemination and accessibility.</AbstractNarration>
