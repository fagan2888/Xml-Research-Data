    <AbstractNarration>Most micro-sized relays (switches) currently on the market or reported in the literature&lt;br/&gt;are solid-state devices made using semiconductor technology, with silicon the predominant&lt;br/&gt;material. Such devices are not best suited for applications that require large power&lt;br/&gt;capability because they typically have low current capacity, low off-resistance, high&lt;br/&gt;on-resistance, high power consumption, and low dielectric strength. In recent years, the&lt;br/&gt;fast-evolving technology of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has opened up new&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for microfabricating microelectromechanical switches. However, most of the&lt;br/&gt;MEMS relays are based on silicon fabrication and can not be used for power applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to design, analyze (model and simulate), microfabricate, and test a new type&lt;br/&gt;of micro-relays using electromagnetic actuation. These relays should have the following&lt;br/&gt;characteristics: fast switching speed, high power capacity, high off-resistance&lt;br/&gt;(completely disconnected), lower on-resistance, and low power consumption and heat&lt;br/&gt;generation. Some preliminary study has been conducted and promising results have been&lt;br/&gt;obtained on the proposed research work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed micro-relays will be fabricated with UV-LIGA (based on UV lithography)&lt;br/&gt;microfabrication technologies. UV-LIGA is based on thick resist (SU-8) and optical&lt;br/&gt;lithography, provides slightly lower quality, much shorter time span for development and&lt;br/&gt;fabrication, and therefore much lower cost. The LIGA processes provide great potential for&lt;br/&gt;building microstructures from a broad selection of materials. Any metals or alloys that&lt;br/&gt;can be electroplated could be used as a potential candidate material for three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;MEMS structural components. The combination of a broad material selection and the&lt;br/&gt;capability of making high aspect ratio microstructures make the technology best suited for&lt;br/&gt;fabricating microelectromechanical relays that can be used in, but not limited to, the&lt;br/&gt;applications of high power capacity. For example, good spring materials like&lt;br/&gt;beryllium-copper, and good electrically conducting materials including copper and gold can&lt;br/&gt;all be electroplated. With improved switching time, the relays may also be used for series&lt;br/&gt;sampling with low feedthroughs. Compared with the commonly used electrostatic actuation,&lt;br/&gt;the proposed electromagnetic actuation has several advantages: stronger actuation force&lt;br/&gt;and potentially higher power capacity, lower possibility of electrostatic sparks</AbstractNarration>
