    <AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES Proposal 0136119&lt;br/&gt;Bruce Lewenstein/David Kirby, Science Consultants, Fictional Films, and the Scientific Process&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a postdoctoral fellowship. David Kirby, the fellowship holder, is pursuing a combined educational and research program focused on the role of science consultants in the production of mainstream entertainment films. The primary goals are to: 1) learn the theory of science studies; 2) learn methods for researching issues of science communication through the media, including interview methods and historical analysis; 3) begin the transition from a career in basic science to a research and teaching career in science studies; and 4) broaden the domain of "Public Understanding of Science" to include science presented in entertainment media. Kirby is trained as an evolutionary and molecular geneticist and seeks preparation for a career as an academic researcher unsing a multi-disciplinary approach to address the ways science and technology are communicated through media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The postdoctoral training component of the project consists of taking core theory and methods courses, participating in the vibrant intellectual life of Cornell's Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies, and working closely with specific faculty members. In addition, the fellowship holder will serve as an assistant editor for the journal "Public Understanding of Science."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activities include literature searches, archival research, document collection, film viewing, and analysis related to mainstream films with science themes. The primary case study is the Jurassic Park series, and will include oral interviews. A related research element concerns the commidification of scientific information. Here attention is given to one individual entrepreneur, Donna Cline, and a science consulting company, Takeoff Technologies.</AbstractNarration>
