    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this research project is to develop new query evaluation and optimization techniques for processing relational queries in main-memory databases. Recent improvements in main memory size and cost suggest that large classes of applications may obtain the performance benefits of having the data in main memory. The project focuses on issues in computer architecture that influence main memory performance, including cache miss latency and branch misprediction penalties. Algorithms for database operations will be developed that are sensitive to these and other issues, and thus perform well on modern architectures. Broader questions such as how to design a comprehensive architecture-sensitive query processing framework will be studied. The algorithms and techniques resulting from this project could have application in commercial and experimental database systems, where they could improve the speed of query processing. Results from the project will be disseminated as research papers and as freely available prototype software.</AbstractNarration>
