    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0104600&lt;br/&gt;Yi Hu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator proposes to give topological constructions of&lt;br/&gt;the Chow quotient by introducing moduli spaces of stable orbits&lt;br/&gt;with prescribed momentum charges and moduli spaces of stable&lt;br/&gt;action-manifolds, respectively. The introductions of stable &lt;br/&gt;orbits and stable action-manifolds follow closely the idea of investigator's earlier work on stable degeneration of polygons. &lt;br/&gt;Note that just like a stable polygon is a collection of ordinary polygons, a stable orbit is a collection of ordinary orbits. The connections from stable orbits and stable action-manifolds to the corresponding Chow cycles are to be established by moment map. &lt;br/&gt;Next, he also attempts to interpret the Uhlenbeck compactification &lt;br/&gt;as a topological analogy of a Chow quotient. In the same vein, &lt;br/&gt;the investigator proposes a moduli problem for stable tuples of homogeneous polynomials of a fixed total degree in two variables.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator anticipates that the resulting moduli space is &lt;br/&gt;the smooth compactification of the variety of holomorphic maps &lt;br/&gt;from one-dimensional projective space to n-dimensional projective &lt;br/&gt;space as constructed in his earlier work on blowups along &lt;br/&gt;arrangements of subvarieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with the fruitful interaction between &lt;br/&gt;topology and algebraic geometry. Algebraic Geometry as a field &lt;br/&gt;is both old and new. It is old because of its long history, &lt;br/&gt;it is new because it is still vigorously developing as one of &lt;br/&gt;the main stream mathematics. It has numerous beautiful connections &lt;br/&gt;and applications to other subjects. Roughly speaking, Algebraic Geometry studies spaces which are locally the set of solutions&lt;br/&gt;of some polynomial equations. Topology is another amazing &lt;br/&gt;mathematical achievement of this century and is the study of &lt;br/&gt;flexible geometrical properties of spaces. One of central &lt;br/&gt;problems in algebraic geometry is the classification of spaces &lt;br/&gt;in algebraic geometry. A key idea here is to treat every type of &lt;br/&gt;spaces as a point in a "master set" which is technically called &lt;br/&gt;a moduli space. This paper focus on the topological and &lt;br/&gt;geometrical aspects of moduli spaces. The proposal consists&lt;br/&gt;of some new ideas and methods which are substantially based &lt;br/&gt;upon investigator's earlier papers, among others.</AbstractNarration>
