    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: PECASE: Creating Novel Quantum Fluids&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California-Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This PECASE project encompasses a broad research program to examine the condensed-matter aspects of a novel quantum fluid: spinor Bose-Einstein condensates of Rb-87. The initial experimental background and the consequent theoretical investigation of this intriguing fluid suggest a range of intriguing phenomena waiting to be explored. A dedicated experimental apparatus is being constructed which incorporates magnetic shielding and small scale magnetic traps, large-volume optical traps, a new type of polarization-contrast imaging, and stable laser beams for Raman coupling. Four experimental goals are identified: (1) the first observation of ferromagnetic F=1 spinor condensates, (2) the exploration of dynamic behavior using a novel in-situ imaging technique, (3) accessing the thermodynamic behavior of spinor condensates, and (4) the first observation of F=2 spinor condensates. In addition, it is expected that other deliberately engineered macroscopic quantum systems will be explored to complement this research program. One such system, which was recently identified by this research group, is a novel superfluid with an anisotropic and variable critical velocity.&lt;br/&gt;These research goals are being pursued alongside a program of educational activities. In particular, the establishment of a resource for teaching innovations in upper-division physics courses is being undertaken. While teaching innovations have been successfully implemented and tested in introductory physics courses, the development of resources to support such innovations in upper-division courses is sorely lacking, in spite of their great need. Particularly needed is a bank of tested qualitative questions appropriate for in-class and web-based inquiry. Such collections will be created and tested in three areas of upper-division modern physics, disseminated for use at other institutions, and supported further by contributions from other educators. Further educational activities include the exploration of web-based course delivery systems, and the training of future scientists through undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral research positions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.</AbstractNarration>
