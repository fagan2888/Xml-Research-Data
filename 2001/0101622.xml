    <AbstractNarration>This project is infusing applied geospatial technology into both the geosciences curricula and into other curricula within the Natural Sciences, Physical Education and Technology Division at Gainesville College (GC), and the College of Arts and Sciences at the State University of West Georgia (UWG). Curricula is being articulated between the two institutions to ensure that available transfer and "reverse transfer" opportunities work smoothly for students in both institutions. The effort contributes toward articulated Bachelors of Science and Associate of Science degree programs in geographic information science, remote sensing, and global positioning systems at the two institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three major elements:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) University of West Georgia is including a new technology course in their core curriculum for mathematics, science, and technology - such courses are required for all undergraduate students. The course is being modeled after the Geographic Information Science course at Gainesville College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Faculty members (GC science program, UWG geoscience program) are integrating remote sensing into the core course described above. This program is being used in faculty development workshops (Introduction to Geospatial Data Analysis for Research and Classroom Applications) and in undergraduate courses. Faculty from other regional institutions are also participating in these workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Faculty from both institutions are working together to ensure course compatibility across the two institutions.</AbstractNarration>
