    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0104402&lt;br/&gt;Lars Andersson &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with the global existence and &lt;br/&gt;cosmic censorship problems for the Einstein equation, and &lt;br/&gt;related issues in Lorentzian and Riemannian geometry. One of &lt;br/&gt;the primary goals is to prove a nonlinear stability result &lt;br/&gt;for the Einstein equation in the cosmological case. For large &lt;br/&gt;data, global existence is a very hard problem, and here the &lt;br/&gt;aim is to identify and study model problems as well as lower dimensional problems derived by symmetry reductions. The &lt;br/&gt;structure of cosmological singularities will be studied &lt;br/&gt;from the point of view of the BKL proposal. For flat, &lt;br/&gt;spatially compact spacetimes, global constant mean curvature&lt;br/&gt;foliations will be studied, in particular their asymptotic &lt;br/&gt;behavior in the expanding direction and near the singularity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Einstein equation, which describes the interaction of &lt;br/&gt;matter with spacetime geometry, is one of the fundamental &lt;br/&gt;classical field equations of modern physics. According to the &lt;br/&gt;world view of modern physics, our universe is described on &lt;br/&gt;large scales by one of the simplest solutions to the Einstein equations, the Friedman-Lemaitre solution. According to this&lt;br/&gt;picture, the universe has developed from a singularity (big bang) &lt;br/&gt;and is expanding. The work in this project is concerned with &lt;br/&gt;the nonlinear stability of this model, the behavior of spacetime &lt;br/&gt;in extreme conditions near the big bang and its ultimate fate &lt;br/&gt;in the expanding direction.</AbstractNarration>
