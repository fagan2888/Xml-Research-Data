    <AbstractNarration>0111665&lt;br/&gt;Dunbar&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award, provided by the Antarctic Geology and Geophysics Program of the Office of Polar Programs, supports US scientific participation in a workshop of the international Antarctic Offshore Acoustic Stratigraphy (ANTOSTRAT) program. ANTOSTRAT is sponsored by the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) and it represents an important community-based group for discussing emerging research issues related to the long-term history of the Antarctic and its ice sheets. The program focuses on coordinated efforts to understand Antarctic paleoenvironments and paleoclimates of the last 130 million years (late Mesozoic and Cenozoic) as recorded in sediments and structures on the continental margin and in the surrounding ocean basins. The ANTOSTRAT activity has been instrumental in achieving several successful Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) drilling legs. This workshop will facilitate integration of results from ODP Legs 178 and 188 with results from the Cape Roberts Project and other related projects. In addition, the program aspires to delineate scientific target areas for potential drilling and to define the drilling technologies that will be required to further advance our understanding of this important time in Earth's history. This workshop will be held in Erice (Sicily), Italy, in September 2001.</AbstractNarration>
