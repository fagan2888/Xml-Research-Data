    <AbstractNarration>0131384&lt;br/&gt;Ma&lt;br/&gt;We are seeking support for the travel costs of speakers invited to participate in the 17th Penn State Symposium in Plant Physiology to be held May 16-18, 2002 in State College, Pennsylvania. This symposium is entitled "Plant reproduction: from evolutionary and physiological analyses to molecular and cellular studies." Plant reproductive biology has been a subject of great interest and intrigue for many generations. In recent years, there have been very rapid advances in our understanding of plant development not only from molecular genetic studies, but also from evolutionary and physiological analyses. The goal of this meeting is to provide an interdisciplinary forum for leading researchers working in diverse areas of plant reproductive biology to present their recent findings, to share their ideas, and to stimulate each other in discussions. The symposium will bring together about 20 outstanding scientists from around the world, many of whom do not regularly attend the same meetings because of their wide-ranging specialties. In addition to the invited talks, we anticipate having approximately 50 contributed posters summarizing current research by scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. The results presented at the symposium will be summarized in a meeting report to be published by one of the leading plant journals. &lt;br/&gt;This symposium will provide a valuable service to the research community. We are not aware of any other symposia that have considered this topic in such an integrated and comprehensive manner. By bringing together scientists using different approaches to study the problems in plant reproduction, the symposium will facilitate novel collaborations and experimental approaches, and will further stimulate progress in this fast advancing and growing field.</AbstractNarration>
