    <AbstractNarration>0117627&lt;br/&gt;Somasundaran &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports US-India cooperative research entitled "Microbe-Mineral Interaction Mechanisms Relevant to Precious Metal Extraction with Environmental Control." The PIs will investigate bioprocessing for the enhanced recovery of precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum and will focus on the mechanisms by which certain microbes adhere to different mineral surfaces and alter interfacial properties. These mechanisms are as yet not very clear. During leaching, metal ions accumulate; some of which may confer toxicity to bacteria. There is need to understand the toxic metal tolerance of selected bacteria and develop more efficient metal tolerant strains. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The collaborators for this research, P. Somasundaran, Columbia University and K. Natarajan, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, have worked successfully in the past and have published in major international journals. Due to growing environmental awareness during the past decade, the use of biotechnology has become attractive as an environmentally benign, cost and energy efficient means for mineral beneficiation and environmental control. This project is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Government of India's Department of Science &amp; Technology.</AbstractNarration>
