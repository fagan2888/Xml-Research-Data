    <AbstractNarration>This Award is to provide for support of an Annual Grantees Conference of Metabolic Engineering Projects funded by Agencies participating in the Interagency Metabolic Engineering Working Group (MEWG). The Conference is scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on June 28, 2001. The objective of this Conference is to provide the funding Agencies with an opportunity to review progress on their Metabolic Engineering Awards. This Conference will also provide an important service to the research community in the area of Metabolic Engineering and may identify opportunities for future research directions. Information generated at this Conference may be useful for planning purposes for the MEWG and the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Programs in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems Division of the NSF Engineering Directorate. Information presented at the Conference will be distilled into a report for NSF and the MEWG.</AbstractNarration>
