    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13) This project is modernizing the introductory physics laboratory using computerized instructional technology. Microcomputer Based Laboratory (MBL) tools that use the RealTime Physics (RTP) program designed by David Sokoloff and Ronald Thornton are being adapted. Students in their first and second year of college and also high school physics instructors and students are participating in the project. The objective is that the student play an active rather than passive role in performing the experiments which include data acquisition, analysis (graphs and calculus) and intuitive inference. Immediate visual display of the experimental results saves time and enhances students' laboratory skills and their ability to retain the physical concepts learned. The implementation of the RTP also allows development of more appropriate laboratory exercises for students with different science majors. The&lt;br/&gt;standardized Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation is being used to evaluate the effectiveness of the methods. An external peer reviewer familiar with education policies in Puerto Rico is also evaluating progress. To better prepare students who may come to the university while still in high school, a summer workshop is being organized for local high school science instructors to assist them in learning new and powerful ways of teaching basic science. Videos tapes showing high school students immersed in physics related experiments are being distributed to local high schools in order to make studying physics more attractive as a career option.</AbstractNarration>
