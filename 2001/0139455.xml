    <AbstractNarration>This project will enable the attendance of students, young scientists and distinguished Russian and East European scientists at the Ninth International Conference on Muon Spin Rotation (MuSR) in Williamsburg, Virginia, June 3-7, 2002. MuSR is in the forefront of research in the richest areas of solid-state physics and chemistry, such as superconductivity, weakly ordered magnetism, defects and diffusion. Although MuSR was first developed in the US, this is the first MuSR conference coordinated by US based MuSR scientists. Many attendees will be from the major MuSR research facilities: TRIUMF in Vancouver, BC; PSI in Switzerland, RAL in the UK; and KEK in Japan. The support for students and young scientists will aid in their further understanding of the field and enable contacts with potential collaborators from the MuSR facilities. The support for Russian and East European scientists will encourage collaborative research, e.g., on understanding the high temperature superconductors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enable the attendance of students, young scientists and distinguished Russian and East European scientists at the Ninth International Conference on Muon Spin Rotation (MuSR) in Williamsburg, Virginia, June 3-7, 2002.
