    <AbstractNarration>This project will fund an Albert Einstein Fellow to work in the Division of Elementary, Secondary, and Informal Education of the National Science Foundation for ten months, beginning August 15, 2001. ESIE, the Program Director, and the Fellow will determine the specific duties of the Einstein Fellow. The majority of the time the Fellow will work on the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching program (PAEMST). It is anticipated the Einstein Fellow will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Work on the professional development component of the PAEMST Program. The PAEMST program works with major national mathematics and science teacher organizations to provide precessions for the Presidential Awardees attending annual meetings of these groups. The Fellow will help design these activities for the past awardees and identify other possible professional development opportunities. This will include but not be limited to helping the Program Director make arrangements for the audiovisual needs of the speakers; conference meals; and selection and coordination of speakers.&lt;br/&gt;2. Act as a liaison with former awardees in the field. &lt;br/&gt;3. Review and screen all state nominee's applications for eligibility and prepare them for the National Selection Committee.&lt;br/&gt;4. Help the Program Director organize the National Selection Committee meeting. &lt;br/&gt;5. Monitor and encourage the submission of requested data from State Coordinators. Collect, organize, and analyze requested data. This includes but is not limited to annual reports, number and category of applications received, and opinion surveys.&lt;br/&gt;6. Assume various responsibilities with respect to the PAEMST Website. &lt;br/&gt;7. Assist in the planning and conduction of the awards week.&lt;br/&gt;8. Review and edit PAEMST correspondence including but not limited to letters, posters, the BioBook, and brochures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF Einstein Fellow will not perform the work of a Program Officer, handle any NSF proposals (including proposals for the PAEMST Program), conduct any part of the review process, or access NSF data systems where access is restricted under the Privacy Act to NSF employees and contractors.&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow will provide three written reports to the Triangle Coalition, which will describe her responsibilities and on-going activities. These will be used to evaluate the Fellow's accomplishments during the Fellowship period and to offer personal perspectives and recommendations to the Fellowship program.</AbstractNarration>
