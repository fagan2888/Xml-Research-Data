    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project will introduce new technology into the introductory Principles of Biology laboratory at Columbus State University. The technology would support and maximize the impact of inquiry-based activities built around the learning cycle approach to science education. Specifically, computers and graphing calculators will be interfaced with an array of probes and sensors to facilitate measurement, quantitative analysis, and presentation of&lt;br/&gt;data. These skills are now critically lacking in our students. The use of these instruments will better engage students in laboratory activities, allow them to experience the use of technology in modern biology, and enhance their ability to visualize and understand the biological phenomena they are exploring in the laboratory. Outcomes will be assessed through comparison of learning and attitudes among students who use the new technology with students who carry out similar experiments without the technology. DUE themes addressed by the project include integration of technology in science education, professional development of science faculty, preparation of future science educators, and participation in science by women and underrepresented minorities. Participation of the PIs in appropriate workshops and specific efforts to share their experiences with colleagues will ensure professional development. Student demographics at CSU guarantee significant involvement in the project of women, underrepresented minorities, and future teachers. Project results will be disseminated through publications and presentations at regional and national meetings, and products will be disseminated through publication on a web site devoted to the project.</AbstractNarration>
