    <AbstractNarration>PEET: Taxonomic and Monographic Studies in Noetropical Trichoptera&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NSF-0117772&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R.W. Holzenthal, P.I., University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;R.J. Blahnik, Co-P.I., University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;S.C. Harris, Co-P.I., University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Trichoptera, commonly known as caddisflies, constitute the largest order of exclusively aquatic insects. They are well known and studied because of the interesting net-spinning and case-making behavior of the larvae. Most species live in rivers and streams, where they are important elements of the ecosystem. They consume and recycle leaves and other organic matter and in turn are fed on by other aquatic species, including fish. A primary goal of this PEET project is to study the taxonomy and biodiversity of several important genera of caddisflies from the Neotropics of Central and South America. Many species in this region are undescribed (up to 75% in some places) or poorly known. Augmenting the technical taxonomic revisions and monographs will be the construction of identification keys to genera of both larval and adult caddisflies to be made available over the World Wide Web (WWW). Much of the material for these revisions already exists in collections in Minnesota and at the Smithsonian, and other material will be collected by field work in Venezuela. Collectively, as many as 44 genera and 400 described species will be revised, and up to 300 new species may be described. In addition, all museum and collection records of the caddisflies treated during the project will be bar-coded, databased, and the information made accessible over the WWW. &lt;br/&gt; Caddisflies are important biological monitors of water quality because most species are intolerant of most forms of pollution. Biomonitoring is widely used in water quality assessment in North America and Europe because the caddisflies there can be easily identified. In the Neotropics, caddisflies are very poorly known, making it difficult to use them as biological monitors. An important aspect of this PEET project will be to make the Neotropical caddisfly fauna better known and information accessible to Latin American workers. This will lay a foundation for the use of caddisflies in biomonitoring programs in the Neotropics. Two doctoral students trained at the University of Minnesota, two masters students trained at Clarion University, and a full-time research associate will be funded off the project. At least one of the doctoral students will be recruited from Latin America where there are very few Trichoptera experts. It is expected that this project will stimulate and facilitate the study of Trichoptera in Latin America and contribute to the protection and preservation of the aquatic ecosystems of the region.</AbstractNarration>
