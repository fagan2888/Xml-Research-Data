    <AbstractNarration>The Computer Science and Mathematics Majors Scholars Corps Program is a four-year plan to encourage and enable academically talented but financially needy students to enter the high technology workforce following completion of a baccalaureate degree in computer science or mathematics at Elizabeth City State University. The project includes establishing and institutionalizing a pre-second year summer program for computer science and mathematics majors; supporting faculty and students to engage in mentoring, research, and internship activities on campus and at industry sites, providing tailored and enhanced academic support services, and providing coordinated career counseling and job placement services. &lt;br/&gt;This four-year project incorporates and builds on existing strengths, addresses deficiencies, and ensures that the 75 scholarship recipients are well prepared for mathematics and computer science related careers.</AbstractNarration>
