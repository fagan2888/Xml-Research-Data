    <AbstractNarration>This research focuses on synthesis of nanoscale magnetic molecules whose magnetic and electrical properties can be tailored by design, and on techniques to "wire" these molecular magnets together to create new nanostructures and nanostructured magnetic materials. The impact of these nanostructured materials on material science may be comparable to that of fullerenes and nanotubes. The studies will focus on high-symmetry molecules, for which phenomena associated with quantum coherence (resonance effects, high magnetic susceptibility, generation of radiation with adjustable frequency) can be observed at reasonable temperatures. Research goals include: 1) designing and synthesizing new magnetic nanoscale molecules; 2) understanding the quantum properties of these large-magnetic-moment molecules; 3) assembling new nanostructures from these molecular building blocks that will exhibit magnetic and electronic effects useful for a new type of electronics based on electronic spin; 4)understanding the interaction of these molecules in complex nanostructures. Graduate students will learn state-of-the-art technology and develop skills that prepare them for careers in industry, academia or government. Selected high school, junior college and four-year college teachers will participate in the research in outreach efforts.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on synthesis of nanoscale magnetic molecules whose magnetic and electrical properties can be tailored by design, and on techniques to "wire" these molecular magnets together to create new nanostructures and nanostructured magnetic materials.
