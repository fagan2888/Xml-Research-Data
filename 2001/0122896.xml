    <AbstractNarration>This program provides financial and academic support for undergraduate students in science and mathematics and masters students in computer science, mathematics, and statistics. Participants are given an intensive orientation, followed by close monitoring throughout the duration of the program. Special aspects of the program include internships, group sessions, outside speakers relating to the disciplines and possible employment. Expected outcomes for undergraduate students are that they are well-prepared for employment in fields requiring intensive computer science or mathematics background or for graduate programs in these fields. Expected outcomes for graduate students are that they obtain a masters degree and employment in a position appropriate to their professional training or will continue with doctoral study.</AbstractNarration>
