    <AbstractNarration>WORKSHOP: 2001 SIGART / AAAI Doctoral Consortium&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a standard award to support the 6th SIGART / AAAI Doctoral Consortium, to be held as a workshop during the 17th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI'01), August 4-10 in Seattle. The Doctoral Consortium will provide a unique opportunity for a group of PhD students to discuss and explore their research interests and career objectives together with a panel of established researchers. The event is similar in spirit to that funded by NSF last year, and has once again attracted a diverse group of student participants who reflect a wide range of topic areas and methodologies within artificial intelligence, and who have settled on their thesis directions but who still have significant research left to do. Selection was based on clarity and completeness of the submission packet, stage of research, advisor's letter, and other evidence of promise such as published papers or technical reports; a complete list of the 14 participants' names and affiliations may be found at http://www.acm.org/sigart/DCparticipants.html. Abstracts of the participants' presentations will be published in the issue of SIGART "Intelligence" that follows the consortium. The request for NSF support is higher this year than last, because Microsoft corporation chose not to cosponsor the event this time. Doctoral Consortium co-chairs are the PI and Marie desJardins, University of Maryland at Baltimore County; the organizing committee also included Janyce M. Wiebe, University of Pittsburgh; Mary P. Harper, Purdue University; Vibhu O. Mittal, Just Research and CMU; and Evangelos Milios, Dalhousie University. Panelists for the 2-day event will include: Robert St. Amant, North Carolina State University; Maria Gini, University of Minnesota; Craig Knoblock, ISI &amp; USC; Gerhard Lakemeyer, Aachen University of Technology; Evangelos Milios, Dalhousie University; Shlomo Zilberstein, University of Massachusetts at Amherst; Stuart Shapiro, SUNY Buffalo; Foster Provost, NYU; and Rebecca Bruce, University of North Carolina at Asheville.</AbstractNarration>
