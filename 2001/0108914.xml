    <AbstractNarration>Hydrogen-containing defects in semiconductors continue to be the subject of intense theoretical and experimental study because of their fascinating microscopic properties and the important role they play in determining the properties of electronic materials and devices. This individual investigator award will provide support for a project to investigate hydrogen-containing defects in Si. The project consists of several complementary thrusts for which recent advances make new studies attractive. The first concerns new opportunities for the study of H2 molecules in semiconductors by vibrational spectroscopy. Other studies are concerned with the structures, vibrational properties, and formation mechanisms of deep-level defects that are complexed with hydrogen. The primary goal of the project is to develop a fundamental understanding of hydrogen in semiconductors and its interactions with other defects and impurities. A variety of techniques will be employed, including vibrational spectroscopy, uniaxial stress, and electron irradiation of Si containing H2 molecules. This experimental research program provides an excellent means to train students in experimental semiconductor physics. The work focuses on important, current problems in semiconductor materials research and provides graduate and undergraduate students a solid foundation for successful careers in industrial research and development.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen in semiconductors has been of interest for many years because of the important effect hydrogen can have on the electrical properties of device materials. For example, hydrogen is a frequent unintentional contaminant that can have deleterious effects on the controlled doping and reliability of semiconductor materials. Alternatively, hydrogen can have beneficial effects in low-cost materials that are highly defective. For example, hydrogen is intentionally introduced into solar-grade Si to increase the efficiency of solar cells. The mechanisms by which hydrogen passivates defects and participates in defect processes remain poorly understood. This individual investigator award will support a project having the primary goal developing a fundamental understanding of hydrogen in semiconductors and its interactions with other defects and impurities.
