    <AbstractNarration>An effective way of providing error resilience for multimedia transmission in a&lt;br/&gt;communication system with a relatively small reduction in efficiency is multiple&lt;br/&gt;description coding (MDC), which assumes the existence of multiple independent&lt;br/&gt;channels between the transmitter and receiver, each of which can be temporarily&lt;br/&gt;down or can experience burst errors. With MDC several coded streams, called&lt;br/&gt;descriptions, are generated and transmitted over different channels. At the&lt;br/&gt;destination, if all of the streams are received error free, than the signal can&lt;br/&gt;be reconstructed at its highest level of fidelity. However, if only one or a few&lt;br/&gt;descriptions are received in a usable form, the receiver can still reconstruct&lt;br/&gt;an acceptable signal. All multiple description coding methods to date assume an&lt;br/&gt;on-off channel model between the transmitter and the receiver; each link is&lt;br/&gt;either broken, in which case the transmitted symbols, or packets, are lost&lt;br/&gt;completely, or it functions properly, in which case the packets are received&lt;br/&gt;free of errors. This model is appropriate for Internet transmission, but it is&lt;br/&gt;not appropriate for wireless channels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study replaces the parallel independent on-off channel model with a&lt;br/&gt;wireless channel model, such as a Rayleigh fading model. Communication is&lt;br/&gt;performed using multiple transmit and receive antennas over the channel. With&lt;br/&gt;these models the signal at any of the receive antennas is the superposition of&lt;br/&gt;the transmitted signals from each transmit antenna independently faded.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, even if the descriptions at the receiver side are completely&lt;br/&gt;independent, the received signal at each antenna will include some information&lt;br/&gt;from each description. This research involves finding the best multiple&lt;br/&gt;description coding strategy for these channels, the theoretical limits of such a&lt;br/&gt;scheme, and the efficiency with which it can be implemented.</AbstractNarration>
