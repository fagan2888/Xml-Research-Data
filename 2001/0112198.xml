    <AbstractNarration>This Doctoral Dissertation Research Support investigation examines the factors that affect citizen trust in government. The investigator attempts to build a complete theory of trust in govermnent. This is done by assuming trust operates as a public decision and that trust will be the result of public information and public disposition. Citizen trust in their government will vary depending on information about government performance and dispositions of ideology, party identification and social capital that are used to interpret that information.&lt;br/&gt;The theory and hypotheses are tested by using a quarterly measure of trust in government for the period 1972 to 2000. This measure of trust in government demonstrates that trust in governmnent varies on a regular basis. The investigator also attempts to assess the effect of trust in government on political participation, voter turnout and elections.</AbstractNarration>
