    <AbstractNarration>The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this award to University of Massachusetts Amherst. With the award, Professor Paul Lahti will study the synthesis and characterization of new stable radicals that incorporates hydrogen bonding groups and coordination groups such as carboxylates, pyridines, imidazoles and fluoroarenes. This interdisciplinary research will use organic, physical and inorganic chemistry as well as physics for crystal engineering to induce ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions and alignments. As part of this award, international collaborations will be carried out with University of Zaragoza in Spain and Osaka University in Japan to study molecular magnetism in organic polymers and materials. Training and education of students in organic synthesis and characterization of novel materials for molecular magnetic applications will be greatly enhanced by this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hydrogen bonding, partial fluorination, co-crystallization and transition metal complexation will be used in crystal engineering to induce and enhance ferromagnetic spin-spin interactions and alignments. This interdisciplinary study will have a broad impact on different field such as physical and organic chemistry, and solid state physics. These studies will provide information about the higher critical temperatures required for ferromagnetic and ferromagnetic applications. In addition, this award will provide education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
