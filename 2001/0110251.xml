    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0110251&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Mikhail Lyubich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference on dynamical systems at SUNY Stony Brook in 2001&lt;br/&gt;is held in honor of John Milnor and emphasizes areas of dynamics&lt;br/&gt;close to his own work: holomorphic dynamics in one and several&lt;br/&gt;variables, non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamics, fluid dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;geometric function theory and thermodynamical formalism, related&lt;br/&gt;topics in topology and in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems are mathematical models of phenomena that&lt;br/&gt;evolve in time according to deterministic laws. Some aspects of&lt;br/&gt;this part of mathematics are extremely classical, since the&lt;br/&gt;differential equations used by Newton to describe motion under&lt;br/&gt;the force of gravity lead to a dynamical system. Although these&lt;br/&gt;models are entirely determined by starting conditions and the&lt;br/&gt;rules for evolution over time, detailed prediction is difficult&lt;br/&gt;and we are obliged to seek qualitative understanding. Over the&lt;br/&gt;last twenty-five years much attention has concentrated on systems&lt;br/&gt;whose evolutionary rule is defined by a polynomial function of a&lt;br/&gt;complex variable, and on the behavior of these systems as the&lt;br/&gt;polynomial's coefficients are changed. This class of systems has&lt;br/&gt;been found to be a universal model in some ways for the behavior&lt;br/&gt;of families of dynamical behavior depending upon a parameter, but&lt;br/&gt;despite their simplicity of definition much remains mysterious&lt;br/&gt;about holomorphic dynamical systems.</AbstractNarration>
