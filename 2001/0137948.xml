    <AbstractNarration>0137948&lt;br/&gt;de Jongh&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided to support the registration fees of the applicants and finalists of the young investigator competition in the conference Computers in Cardiology, Memphis Cook Convention Center, Memphis, Tennessee, September 22-25, 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of conferences on computers in cardiology was established 28 years ago in recognition of the import role that computer technology would play in cardiovascular research and in clinical patient care. The conferences also facilitate important productive communication between engineers and clinicians that stimulates relevant research and development. Participants have found the meetings to be particularly helpful because of the manageable size, and the commonality of interests of attendees that fosters interpersonal interaction outside the formal sessions. Computers in Cardiology has proven to be a major world forum for presentation of new research over a wide spectrum of computer applications in cardiology. The conference serves as the prime site for gestation and early nourishment of a number of fundamental technologies that have led to major improvements in the practice of cardiology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results from this award are expected to have broad impacts through the published Proceedings, which are to be produced by the IEEE press, with copies distributed to the attendees and some 300 libraries. Of special significance is the fostering of interdisciplinary research between researchers in different fields including medicine, physics, engineering, and computer science.</AbstractNarration>
