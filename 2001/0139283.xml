    <AbstractNarration>One of the most important factors in quality of life for the elderly is their ability to move about independently. Mobility impairments due to age, injury or disease cause a downward trend in their quality of life. Lack of independence and exercise can have dramatic results. Although various types of mobility aids exist in research labs and on the market, walkers are used more than any mobility aid except the cane. Our work is concerned with developing an intelligent walker to assist the elderly and increase the ease and safety of their daily travels. The benefits to the user include assistance avoiding dangerous situations (obstacles, drops, etc.) and help with navigation through cluttered environments. It is hoped that this assistance will provide the user with a feeling of safety and autonomy that will encourage them to move about more, incurring the benefits of walking and helping them to carry out the activities of daily living (ADLs). Our walker employs a shared control strategy in which both the user and the walker can provide control of the walker"s heading. By dynamically shifting the balance between the degree of control provided by the walker and that provided by the user, our prototype can extend the time that a user can move independently on both a long term (as user abilities changes with age) and a short term (as user abilities change due to fatigue or medicinal cycles) basis. This point is critical because our work seeks to augment the abilities that people possess instead of replacing them. While wheelchairs and other self-powered mobility aids are viable solutions for some people, they are not a panacea. Our work seeks to help people who can and want to walk.</AbstractNarration>
