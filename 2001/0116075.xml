    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research equipment being acquired through this grant is an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) with analytical accessories and sub-stages. Modern ESEMs offer more flexibility than conventional scanning electron microscopes in obtaining qualitative and analytical results for a wider variety of applications. The system to be acquired will combine high vacuum, low vacuum and gaseous environment operation to support a wide array of research projects. The ESEM will permit examination of non-conducting, contaminated, hydrated and even living samples, which will in turn promote a greater degree of cross-disciplinary research. Standard secondary and back-scatter electron detection can be used in high vacuum mode for conventional operation or low vacuum mode for low overview magnifications. These detectors are also compatible with gaseous environments allowing for examination of hydrated or solvent-based samples. They are also tolerant of elevated temperatures making examination of samples at temperatures up to 1000 C possible. The microscope's capability can be further improved by adding a x-ray detector for energy dispersive spectroscopy. The overall system will be integrated with several sub-stages as well. These sub-stages allow for dynamic experiments (mechanical and thermal) under any of the environments compatible with the microscope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The microscope is to be used to support various research activities at Kettering University. While the majority of research at Kettering University has focused on more applied industrial projects, an ESEM permits more fundamental research of material characterization and behavior. The research conducted using the ESEM will include in-situ characterization of the mechanical behavior of metallic samples, phase transformations in polymeric systems, biomedical research in musculoskeletal pain and bone/implant interfaces and anti-oxidative mechanisms in cancer resistant cells, to name a few. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ESEM will also be used for undergraduate education and training in materials behavior and characterization. The intuitive, computer-based interface permits rapid training and ease of use. Students at Kettering University are required to participate in a co-operative employment program. Giving students the skills needed to operate an ESEM could have direct benefit to their co-op employers, possibly resulting in industry-sponsored research for faculty and an increase in external users of the equipment. Further, the potential to interface with the ESEM control software over the network will make remote control of the microscope from a classroom environment an important aspect of the educational benefits of the instrument.</AbstractNarration>
