    <AbstractNarration>Interest in the solid state sciences has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines into various areas of materials research and development. The 2001 Electron Distribution &amp; Chemical Bonding Gordon Research Conference will explore the nature of chemical bonding as the glue that holds atoms together and also gives materials most of their properties. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid state science and materials research and development. The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and junior faculty. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The materials research and development community continues to have direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by designing, synthesizing and characterizing new materials such as magnetic, electronic, and biomolecular materials. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
