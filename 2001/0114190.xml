    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0114190&lt;br/&gt;N. Jensen, University of California - Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An International Conference on Computational Nanoscience is planned for the period between March 18-21, 2001 in Hilton Head, South Carolina. Its main purpose is to bring together experts from the fields of computational biology, chemistry and material sciences in combination with their industrial end users. It is to be run in parallel (space and time), with the fourth International Conference on Modeling and Simulation of Microsystems. It is hoped that maximum synergy will be obtained in this manner. In particular, emphasis will be given to the recent advances in molecular dynamics and ab initio methods, and to their applications to the design of semi-conductors, drugs and biodiagnostics. The interaction of speakers, researchers, students and private sector representative will result in the interchange of ideas and the stimulation and technical innovation. The conference is co-funded by both the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems and The Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
