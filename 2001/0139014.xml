    <AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site that will host a total of ten students during ten weeks of summer research. Students will be working with researchers at the University of Delaware's College of Marine Studies (CMS) located in Lewes, DE. Students will also participate in a series of seminars and workshops exploring issues related to marine science, career options, and graduate education. The program recruits juniors and senior undergraduate students nationwide. These students are able to pursue research in a broad range of marine science, environmental science and marine engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has an excellent record of success with past groups of students and contains all the important elements of a good REU program, including a thorough orientation program, a well-designed lecture series, a research cruise, an ethics program, and required oral and written presentations. Past publication rates by students have been excellent. The number of scientists involved in the program and potential research projects for students is excellent. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is based on the theory that mentoring and networking are the most effective methods for recruiting students into a profession and for training young researchers. It will advance students' awareness concerning important environmental issues. Students selected for participation in this program gain a significant appreciation for the scientific process and often pursue a career in a scientific field. Matching funding provided by the University includes approximately one month of salary for the PIs.</AbstractNarration>
