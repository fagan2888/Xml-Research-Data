    <AbstractNarration>0140046&lt;br/&gt;Zhang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the initial stage of relativistic nuclear collisions, enormous amount&lt;br/&gt;of energy is deposited in the collision region and the temperature and&lt;br/&gt;density can be high enough that individual hadrons lose their identities.&lt;br/&gt;Instead of being confined in hadrons, quarks and gluons can now move&lt;br/&gt;"freely" in this collision region. The matter thus produced is called the&lt;br/&gt;Quark-Gluon Plasma. The transition between hadronic matter and the&lt;br/&gt;Quark-Gluon Plasma gives us insight into the interactions between quarks and&lt;br/&gt;gluons under extreme conditions. It is also useful for the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;processes going on in other high temperature and/or high density regions,&lt;br/&gt;for example, in the early Universe and in the cores of neutron stars. To&lt;br/&gt;extract information about the Quark-Gluon Plasma from the experimental&lt;br/&gt;observables, to bridge the initial quark and gluon distributions and the&lt;br/&gt;final hadron distributions, the PI will investigate the effects of the&lt;br/&gt;space-time evolution of the strongly interacting matter produced in&lt;br/&gt;relativistic collisions. In particular, a transport model approach will be&lt;br/&gt;further developed and used as the major theoretical tool for a detailed&lt;br/&gt;study of the transient formation and evolution of the finite size,&lt;br/&gt;ultradense system produced in relativistic nuclear collisions with&lt;br/&gt;nonequilibrium, viscous effects automatically taken into account. The&lt;br/&gt;research will advance the understanding of strong interaction physics that&lt;br/&gt;is the focus of current experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider&lt;br/&gt;at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the nuclear physics program at the&lt;br/&gt;future Large Hadron Collider at CERN.</AbstractNarration>
