    <AbstractNarration>Nolan&lt;br/&gt;0104573&lt;br/&gt; The investigator seeks to improve ultrasound imaging in&lt;br/&gt;order for it to be a more effective tool in breast cancer&lt;br/&gt;diagnosis and treatment. He uses modern methods of partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations and microlocal analysis to provide images&lt;br/&gt;of the breast that are artifact-free and of a higher resolution&lt;br/&gt;than currently available. He models propagation and scattering of&lt;br/&gt;ultrasonic waves using microlocal analysis and geometrical&lt;br/&gt;optics. In particular, the approach uses the complete waveform of&lt;br/&gt;the ultrasound instead of just its phase. Microlocal analysis&lt;br/&gt;provides a clear explanation of artifacts that appear in acoustic&lt;br/&gt;images. More importantly, it provides a means of avoiding and&lt;br/&gt;removing such artifacts. To help in obtaining clear images, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator looks for an arrangement of transducers providing&lt;br/&gt;the strongest measurable scattered signal at the surface of the&lt;br/&gt;breast. The optimal configuration is based on a power method that&lt;br/&gt;starts with a non-zero arbitrary source and measures the&lt;br/&gt;resulting scattered field (caused by a tumor for example) at the&lt;br/&gt;surface. He models the scattering process with a linear&lt;br/&gt;scattering operator based on the wave equation. The scattering&lt;br/&gt;operator maps sources to scattered wave fields, whereas the&lt;br/&gt;adjoint scattering operator maps scattered wave fields to&lt;br/&gt;sources. By composing the scattering operator with its adjoint,&lt;br/&gt;he uses the power method to find the eigenfunction corresponding&lt;br/&gt;to the largest scattered signal. Novel in the approach is the&lt;br/&gt;ability to couple the power method with geometrical optics. This&lt;br/&gt;provides an analytical tool for computing the optimal sources&lt;br/&gt;that can then be implemented computationally in a very efficient&lt;br/&gt;way for both modeling and imaging the inversion.&lt;br/&gt; This work aims to provide a new method of imaging the female&lt;br/&gt;breast for use in diagnosing and treating of breast cancer. The&lt;br/&gt;technique is based on ultrasound waves, howver it uses much more&lt;br/&gt;information from these waves than is currently used. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the shape of the waves that bounce off of a lesion or&lt;br/&gt;tumor in the breast is analyzed. The method is tailored to avoid&lt;br/&gt;artifacts that can appear in current imaging techniques. In&lt;br/&gt;addition, the method will be fast and feasible to implement.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the reliability and clarity of the images, this new&lt;br/&gt;imaging technique should significantly cut down on the number of&lt;br/&gt;unnecessary biopsies that are currently carried out in the United&lt;br/&gt;States each year. Because of the speed of the method, it can help&lt;br/&gt;to provide a quick diagnosis. The method also takes advantage of&lt;br/&gt;recently developed three dimensional imaging technology.&lt;br/&gt;Ultrasound is a tried and safe method of imaging; it involves no&lt;br/&gt;harmful radiation. The method is general enought that it could&lt;br/&gt;concievably have spin-offs into other modes of imaging (X-Ray,&lt;br/&gt;MRI, etc.). Finally, this new method of imaging should create&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for new and established companies to manufacture&lt;br/&gt;devices that take advantage of it.</AbstractNarration>
