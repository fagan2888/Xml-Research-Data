    <AbstractNarration>This planning grant proposal is written in response to the NSF 00-131 Program&lt;br/&gt;Solicitation for Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;Program (HBCU-UP). We believe that this planning grant will provide substantial&lt;br/&gt;assistance to Savannah State University (SSU) in conducting an assessment of science,&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) education. Accordingly, Savannah&lt;br/&gt;State University will develop an institutional plan to enhance SMET education through &lt;br/&gt;curriculum improvement, faculty development, and infrastructure facility acquisition&lt;br/&gt;and utilization. This planning grant will not only significantly enhance the academic &lt;br/&gt;environment at SSU, it will also assist the institution in assessing its strong programs&lt;br/&gt;as well as those SMET disciplines, where SSU is not producing enough qualified &lt;br/&gt;graduates (with GPA 3.0 or higher) to enter graduate programs, be competitive and &lt;br/&gt;receive their Masters or Ph.D. degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Savannah State University is already assessing its programs and thus NSF support&lt;br/&gt;will complement our planning process to improve curricula and instructional &lt;br/&gt;programs in those disciplines that are not producing large enough numbers of&lt;br/&gt;well qualified graduates entering graduate school or the work force in SMET-&lt;br/&gt;related fields. This assessment period will end during the mid-semester in the &lt;br/&gt;Spring of 2001; planning will take place between March 2001 and August 2001. &lt;br/&gt;We anticipate receiving continued support from the NSF to plan the SMET&lt;br/&gt;improvement grant proposal.</AbstractNarration>
