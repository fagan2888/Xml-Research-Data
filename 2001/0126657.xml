    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;In this project we are developing four hands-on interdisciplinary experiments from a variety of engineering laboratories within Rowan University. Our project is providing a model for hands-on interdisciplinary experimentation for use in introductory materials science courses. The development of these hands-on laboratory experiments are addressing concerns expressed by ABET and the Engineering Education Coalitions. The experiments will be incorporated into the curriculum at Rowan University. Our testing machines has been interfaced with computer data acquisition and control systems. Rather than purchasing new equipment this project is adapted from the work done by McDonald, Adams, and Mahajan. Our equipment will be modernized in a similar fashion to help our students perform, observe, and analyze the measurements that characterize the behavior of engineering materials. As a compliment to this laboratory experience we have our undergraduate students working with industrial sponsors in material science related research. By combining the two experiences, laboratory studies and fieldwork, students are gaining an appreciation for the practical aspects of materials characterization. The results of our project are being disseminated through relevant journals and through the use of an Engineering Clinic that emphasizes hands-on learning.</AbstractNarration>
