    <AbstractNarration>0112251&lt;br/&gt;Garrick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will support the "Second International Workshop on Iron and Copper Homeostasis", to be held in Pucon, Chile. Organized by Dr. Michael D. Garrick of SUNY in collaboration with Dr. Marco T. Nunez of the University of Chile, &lt;br/&gt;the objective of this workshop is to strengthen international scientific collaboration in research on iron and copper metabolism, and to stimulate the interest of young scientists and students in an area highly relevant to the understanding of toxicology, health and disease states. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iron and copper metabolisms are intimately intertwined: systemic copper deficiency generates cellular iron deficiency, which in humans results in diminished work capacity, reduced intellectual capacity, diminished growth, alterations in bone mineralization, diminished immune response and other symptoms. This workshop will try to provide a better understanding of iron and copper metabolisms and particularly of their interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop will convene leading scientists in the fields of iron and copper metabolism from North America, South America, Europe, Israel and Japan, to exchange knowledge, and to establish future avenues of collaborative research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
