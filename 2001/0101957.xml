    <AbstractNarration>This project utilizes scientists from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, the National Park Service, and Portland and Oregon State Universities to provide middle and high school science teachers with authentic work in environmental monitoring and forest research at one of the National Forests. The project provides a five-week summer research experience for teachers who will be partnered with field scientists. Five additional days of professional development training are provided during the school year to ensure transfer to the classroom. Teachers begin the program by working on an established project with forest scientists, and then create a short inquiry project of their own to be used with their students during the school year. Novice teachers work with mentor teachers in implementing the research projects. Mentor training is provided during the summer and the school year. This project will educate 105 mentor and 210 novice science teachers over four years. In the third year the project will be extended to a site that will be run by the University of Northern Colorado. Teachers at this new site will be will be recruited from Colorado, Wyoming and Montana.</AbstractNarration>
