    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0111840&lt;br/&gt;College of William &amp; Mary&lt;br/&gt;Nikos P. Chrisochoides&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS: Introducing the Next Generation of Computational Scientists in the Science and Art of Meshing&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;International Meshing Roundtable (IMR) takes place every year in the United States. IMR attracts researchers from universities, national laboratories, and computer vendors from the US, Canada, many countries from Europe, Japan, and some countries from South America. IMR is an ideal forum to attract and excite young researchers in the field of mesh generation. Graduate students selection for travel support will be based on two criteria: ( i ) advanced students will present their own papers accepted by the IMR program committee ( ii ) not so advanced students will be asked to submit one page statements of interest signed by their advisor and/or chairman of their department.</AbstractNarration>
