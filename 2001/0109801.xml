    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the software platform, GeneRx, to incorporate pharmacogenetics and nonlinear adaptive algorithms toward optimizing anti-hypertension therapy on a patient specific basis. Preliminary studies on the psychotropic drug, olanzapine, show a 40% patient-by-patient error between predicted starting dose and optimal therapeutic dose, using a prototype trained only with patient chart information. This is a significant reduction from the range of starting doses for olanzapine currently used, which is from 1 to 80 mg/day. Anti-hypertensive drugs, like psychotropic drugs, have a large window of therapeutic options, including significant variation in dosages, medications, and combinations of therapies used. Using patient information and blood samples from a hypertension study done elsewhere, this Phase I project proposes to apply GeneRx to include genetic data in the modeling of hypertension treatment in combination with patient chart data. Genetic data for each patient will be acquired by genotyping DNA from the blood samples, scored as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present or absent in key hypertension-related genes. GeneRx will take a patient's individual genetic, demographic, and environmental variables and predict if initial diuretic medication or initial beta-blocker medication will be effective. A more efficient method to prescribe effective anti-hypertension therapy would expedite recovery, minimize side effects, and reduce medical costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the field of healthcare management.</AbstractNarration>
