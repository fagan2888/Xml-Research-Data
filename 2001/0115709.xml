    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Jodi Enos-Berlage at Luther College to purchase a scanning laser confocal microscope. This instrument, which enables three-dimensional imaging and superior resolution of biological specimens, has become an essential tool for modern biological research. This microscope will be used for eight projects that will enhance research and education at Luther College. These projects span diverse areas of biological research, including studies of plant physiology, developmental biology, eukaryotic cell biology, bacterial "multicellularity", and techniques in light microscopy. The eight proposed projects include four faculty/student research projects and four upper division courses, representing the research and teaching activities of at least 5 science faculty in two different departments (Biology and Chemistry). Acquisition of a confocal microscope will increase student research opportunities at Luther College and is expected to result in a concomitant increase in the number of students that pursue graduate studies in science, along with preparing them better for this endeavor. Together with the faculty, we expect that 60-70 students will be users of this instrument on an annual basis.&lt;br/&gt; The eight projects that will utilize scanning laser confocal microscopy (SLCM) are as follows: In project 1, SCLM will be used to study various forms of bacterial "multicellularity". The model organism Vibrio parahaemolyticus will be used to determine how bacterial cells are organized in colonies and biofilms, how these communities develop, and what environmental and bacterial factors are required. Project 2 will utilize SCLM to investigate lipid trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Fluorescent lipid analogs will be used as probes to study the concentration, movement, and metabolism of lipids and to determine the factors that influence the sorting mechanisms of lipids. Project 3 involves investigating the nature of plant border cells, which form at the root tips of plants and easily detach to form a specialized root tissue. SCLM will be used to examine border cell production and characterize their potential involvement in a fungal pathogen-plant interaction. The developmental biology of the model organism Drosophila is the focus of project 4. Confocal microscopy will be used to assay developmental protein localization patterns in Drosophila embryos of wild type and mutant strains. In project 5, bacterial biofilms will be investigated in a general microbiology course. Students will grow biofilms, observe their development using SCLM, and identify environmental factors that affect biofilm formation. Project 6 will incorporate confocal microscopy into an existing course in light microscopy. Various laboratories will be developed to demonstrate how SCLM is being used for current research and to train students on the operation of the instrument. In project 7, confocal microscopy will be used to demonstrate concepts in a biochemistry laboratory course. Eukaryotic cellular processes and organelle structure and function will be examined using a variety of fluorescently-labeled probes. Finally, project 8 will utilize SCLM for an integrative laboratory experience in cell biology. Specifically, students will use fluorescently-labeled antibodies that crosslink cell surface proteins to examine the structure and fluidity of the plasma membrane and functioning of the cytoskeleton.&lt;br/&gt; The research projects described above will increase understanding of a number of important biological processes. A better understanding of such processes has broad implications. For example, knowledge of bacterial biofilm formation will aid in control of these structures, which play a role bacterial pathogenesis. Understanding lipid trafficking will aid in diagnosis and treatment of persons with disorders caused by alterations in these processes. A more thorough understanding of plant-pathogen interactions will facilitate improvements in controlling plant infectious diseases. Knowledge of Drosophila development can be applied to developmental processes in humans. Significantly, several of the above projects involve an educational component. By using the confocal microscope, students will have a better understanding of a variety of biological processes and modern techniques. The general and scientific communities will benefit by having persons that are better educated in these areas.</AbstractNarration>
