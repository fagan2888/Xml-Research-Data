    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a prototype instrument for measuring harmful bi-products of chlorination in drinking water. These disinfection bi-products are subject to EPA regulations. The Phase I project demonstrated that the concept of differential UV absorption measurement, i.e. absorption before and after chlorination, is suitable for the needed measurement. A pre-production prototype instrument will be constructed during the Phase II project. This device shall employ a multi-pass cell design using our novel dual-ratio technique that eliminates concerns about long term drifts. The overall instrument architecture design and systems design will be carried out prior to assembly of the full microprocessor-controlled recording device. Extensive laboratory and field tests will be used to review design changes before production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential commercial applications of the instrument proposed may be used in the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory or in-line at utilities. The market for the proposed product is quite substantial as EPA regulations will result in the installation of such devices at all utilities and drinking water facilities.</AbstractNarration>
