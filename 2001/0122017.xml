    <AbstractNarration>The investigators will design and develop a computer-based radar simulator that includes the transmitter, ionospheric scattering, and receiver system. The simulator provides a framework by which experimenters can optimally configure a radar system for particular ionospheric conditions. There is a long-standing need in the space science radar community for more well-trained students and scientific radar users. The Advanced Radar System addresses both of those needs. If successful, it can be used in a classroom setting in which students can interactively modify different parts of the system and examine the resulting effect on the received radar signal. This is an excellent means for training the next generation of radar experts. For radar users, the Advance Radar System provides a means to configure a radar-operating mode in a virtual fashion prior to the actual experiment. This will enable the experimenter to modify the operating mode to gain the optimal results from the observations. Finally, the proposed system may eventually replace outdated hardware and software at existing and planned radar systems. The versatility of the digital approach to signal analysis will be demonstrated by configuring the simulator to reproduce the functions of a simple AM radio.</AbstractNarration>
