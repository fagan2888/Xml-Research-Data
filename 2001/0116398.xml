    <AbstractNarration>This is award from the Major Instrumentation program and the NSF/EPSCOR program to the University of New England is for the acquisition of a networked scanning probe microscope (SPM). The instrument will support undergraduate research and training in the fields of biophysics, biochemistry and microbiology. The SPM will provide the university with a multi-disciplinary research facility that will help to bridge the artificial divide between life sciences and the physical sciences. The SPM will support several research topics such as the study of the growth process of biofilms, the study of the structure and property relationship of metallocarbhedrenes, growth, kinetics and structure of novel four stranded G -wires, and modeling and self-assembly. Students will have networked access to the SPM. The award will provide research and training opportunity making students from this EPSCoR state more competitive in the flourishing area of biotechnology and semiconductor industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is award from the Major Instrumentation program and the NSF/EPSCOR program to the University of New England is for the acquisition of a networked scanning probe microscope (SPM).
