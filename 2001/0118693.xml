    <AbstractNarration>The project will address the need for taxonomic research and training on one of the dominant faunal groups in the marine environment, the polychaete annelid worms. Four families will form the core of taxonomic work, the Cirratulidae, Orbiniidae, Scalibregmatidae, and Spionidae. The primary monographic focus will be on the Cirratulidae in which homology of characters is controversial and genera currently poorly defined. Data base activities will focus on making as much information as possible accessible for these four polychaete families. Comparative studies will use a wide range of techniques and characters including light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, reproductive biology, larval morphology and development, and development, and molecular techniques where appropriate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This work will make many common and important components of marine environments accurately identifiable and will train a doctoral student in modern systematic methods. This student will develop a dissertation based upon a portion of the monograph of Cirratulidae, thereby acquiring the special knowledge and skills needed for a career in polychaete taxonomy. Conclusions will be made accessible to a wide user community via the World Wide Web.</AbstractNarration>
