    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of the conference is to encourage intellectual discourse on emerging statistical topics&lt;br/&gt;that honor Wayne Fuller's forty plus years of contributions to statistics and fields of application. To do&lt;br/&gt;so, we have several goals for the conference:&lt;br/&gt;1. To advance statistical knowledge in the areas of time series analysis, measurement error models,&lt;br/&gt;and survey sampling. To achieve this goal, we have invited a distinguished slate of statisticians who&lt;br/&gt;will present their work in three sessions.&lt;br/&gt;2. To highlight the importance of applications and the impact that statistical developments have in other&lt;br/&gt;fields of inquiry. For this purpose, we have invited a set of researchers who will discuss the&lt;br/&gt;influence of Fuller's work in various areas, including dietary assessment, small area estimation, econometrics and economics.&lt;br/&gt;3. To provide a friendly and open environment in which young statisticians can present their work and&lt;br/&gt;interact with senior statisticians. We plan to achieve this goal by inviting researchers in the early&lt;br/&gt;stages of their careers to present a talk in one of the invited sessions or in the special poster area&lt;br/&gt;that will be dedicated to young investigators.&lt;br/&gt;4. To gather statisticians from all over the world for a two-day celebration of statistics in general and of&lt;br/&gt;Fuller in particular. A lively exchange of ideas and knowledge, a definition of future directions for&lt;br/&gt;research in these important areas, and a fostering of communication and collaboration among&lt;br/&gt;researchers at different stages of their careers and from different geographic locations are lasting&lt;br/&gt;results from the conference that we hope to produce.</AbstractNarration>
