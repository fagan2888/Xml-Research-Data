    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since this world is built around geometric objects, we should not be surprised that many areas in computer science and engineering focus on representing, processing, and modeling geometric objects. These familiar areas include computer graphics, computer-aided design, 3D vision, visualization, robotics, NC machining, molecular modeling, terrain modeling and GIS. However, a typical computer science curriculum has a little or even no discussion about computing with geometry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses this deficiency in the training of future computer professionals, especially at a time that more and more applications require highly trained programmers with geometric and modeling skills. This project is an extension of a previous very successful proof-of-concept project, Geometric Computing in the Undergraduate Computer Science Curricula. A web-based textbook and a software tool DesignMentor were developed and used worldwide and are highly regarded. The project builds on the lessons learned in this previous project and on the experiences of instructors and users from all over the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a set of comprehensive, elementary, and flexible course materials for teaching topics in computing with geometry that can be used in a dedicated course or across several courses (e.g., computing with geometry, computer graphics, computer-aided design, geometric modeling, and visualization). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A secondary goal is to develop tools with which students can experiment and visualize the concepts, geometric algorithms, and skills in an intuitive, non-mathematical, and learning-by-doing way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With a set of well-organized contemporary course materials and pedagogical tools, we expect that students will be familiar with the state-of-the-art of computing in the geometric world, acquire basic knowledge and skills, know how to handle geometric problems in different applications and environments, and be well-prepared to approach geometric applications and their software development with confidence. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, this project may also improve the retention rate of students, especially those geometric-minded students who may not perform well in traditional courses, in computer science. On the other hand, this project may also help students who are weak in visualization and geometry to improve their skills. Most importantly, this project impacts the future by preparing computer scientists, mathematicians, and engineers for professions that need a solid foundation in computing with geometry.</AbstractNarration>
