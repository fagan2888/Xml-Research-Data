    <AbstractNarration>Scientists at the Kansas State University Plant Resistance to Insects&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory have identified several molecular markers linked to genes&lt;br/&gt;expressing resistance to the Russian wheat aphid, a serious pest of cereal&lt;br/&gt;grain crops in Africa, North America, and South America. In order to&lt;br/&gt;conduct more detailed research, the Principal Investigator of this Minority Career Advancement Award, Dr. Smith, will obtain hands-on research training&lt;br/&gt;in the use of RFLP marker linkage analysis, cDNA cloning, and cDNA and BAC&lt;br/&gt;sequencing. The specific new skills to be acquired will be plant RNA and&lt;br/&gt;plasmid DNA isolation, Southern and Northern blotting and hybridization,&lt;br/&gt;construction of a subtractive cDNA library, and sequence analysis of DNA&lt;br/&gt;clones. Experiments will be conducted during the training that will provide&lt;br/&gt;information about the linkages of various RFLP loci to the Dn6 Russian wheat&lt;br/&gt;aphid resistance gene, and initial information about possible DNA sequences&lt;br/&gt;related to Dn6. Thus, this information will serve as a starting point for&lt;br/&gt;further research on aphid resistance gene sequences. Dr. Smith will also&lt;br/&gt;attend a course in bioinformatics at Kansas State University and attend two&lt;br/&gt;continuing education conferences which emphasize bioinformatics. Knowledge&lt;br/&gt;gained from these educational activities will be used to update three&lt;br/&gt;courses dealing with plant resistance to pests in which Dr. Smith serves as&lt;br/&gt;instructor or co-instructor. Information and experience derived from the&lt;br/&gt;research and training objectives of the current proposal will provide&lt;br/&gt;students enrolled in these courses current information on plant genomics,&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics, and gene sequencing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RFLP - restriction fragment length polymorphism; cDNA - complementary DNA;&lt;br/&gt;BAC- bacterial artificial chromosome</AbstractNarration>
