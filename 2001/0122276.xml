    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for the purchase of a 28 foot pontoon boat equipped with 90 hp. motor and davit for the Fred Telonicher Marine Laboratory. The boat, which will be capable of carrying 15 persons, will be used for courses and research, largely in shallow areas near the Laboratory . The Laboratory provides a diverse set of marine-oriented research and education programs, including graduate, undergraduate and K-12 programs, but with emphasis on college level classes. The boat will facilitate access to estuarine habitats at or near the mouths of several nearby rivers, and will allow use of bottom-sampling devices for research into the physical composition of the ocean floor and the physiology and population biology of various plants, animals and microbes that inhabit the areas.</AbstractNarration>
