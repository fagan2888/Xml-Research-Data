    <AbstractNarration>The research objective of this grant is to develop scientific techniques for digital transformation of computer generated mechanical designs with spatially optimized topology, geometry, material composition and properties directly into physical realizations of functional mechanisms. This objective will be accomplished by developing two key components: (1) a design methodology for automated, computer aided design synthesis of compliant systems that are spatially optimized with respect to function, form and material composition; and (2) a methodology for automated, solid freeform fabrication of such systems with true, three-dimensional material heterogeneity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will pioneer the integrated design and fabrication of heterogeneous, multi-functional, compliant systems. The design algorithms to be developed as part of this project will introduce a new way of designing complex mechanisms. They will allow the designer to develop designs optimized not only with respect to geometric, topological and kinematic considerations, but also with spatially optimized material composition and properties. The fabrication methods developed in this project will enable the construction of multi-material, multi-functional compliant systems that cannot be fabricated by any other manufacturing methods. This is a unique marriage of digital design and digital fabrication. Therefore, this project provides a seamless integration of design synthesis, selective material deposition and freeform fabrication.</AbstractNarration>
