    <AbstractNarration>We propose to develop an architecture and theoretical underpinnings for providing absolute delay&lt;br/&gt;guarantees for HTTP traffic. HTTP traffic constitutes an overwhelming majority of all Internet&lt;br/&gt;traffic today. Both network load and user-perceived end-to-end response time of web requests&lt;br/&gt;depend not only on network conditions but also on the performance of web proxy caches around&lt;br/&gt;major network backbones. For example, in an HTTP-dominated network, increasing the total&lt;br/&gt;amount of cached data may increase hit ratio and subsequently decrease both network load and&lt;br/&gt;network delay. Hence, an architecture for end-to-end web traffic delay guarantees should explicitly&lt;br/&gt;consider the effect of caching. It is the joint consideration of caching and network performance that&lt;br/&gt;separates our work from prior efforts on delay guarantees. Essentially, the joint problem considers&lt;br/&gt;data placement (replication) as a dimension to manipulate for affecting traffic delays. The approach&lt;br/&gt;is cost-effective since data storage is cheaper than network bandwidth.&lt;br/&gt; The first contribution of this project is to develop a scheme for network load control that relies&lt;br/&gt;on adaptive data prefetching. The architecture can be thought of as replacing admission control&lt;br/&gt;at the network boundary. In an HTTP context, while admission control would prevent a client's&lt;br/&gt;request from entering the network, data prefetching would bring the information to the client's&lt;br/&gt;side before it is requested, hence de ecting the request away from the backbone. While prefetching&lt;br/&gt;itself introduces traffic, the performance gain comes from the fact that, unlike serving live requests,&lt;br/&gt;prefetching can occur at a lower priority in the background without jeopardizing user-perceived&lt;br/&gt;network performance. Hence, prefetching removes time constraints from a big chunk of HTTP&lt;br/&gt;traffic which can now be served at a lower priority. Consequently, the remaining (live) HTTP&lt;br/&gt;traffic will receive better service from the network.&lt;br/&gt; The second main contribution of the project is a theoretical derivation of the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between network resource utilization and the satisfaction of end-to-end deadlines. Specifically, we&lt;br/&gt;prove that keeping network resource utilization due to live web traffic below a given threshold&lt;br/&gt;ensures that all ow deadlines are met. We call this threshold, the overcommitment threshold .&lt;br/&gt;This result allows us to associate deadlines with live web traffic and ensure their satisfaction simply&lt;br/&gt;by performing utilization control. The result obviates maintaining per- ow state in the network for&lt;br/&gt;the purposes of satisfying absolute delay guarantees.&lt;br/&gt; Merging the aforementioned contributions together, we propose to use our adaptive prefetching&lt;br/&gt;scheme to keep the amount of live web traffic below the overcommitment threshold. Hence, we&lt;br/&gt;ensure the satisfaction of absolute delay guarantees while requiring neither admission control on the&lt;br/&gt;network boundary nor per- ow state in routers. The architecture calls only for service differentiation&lt;br/&gt;in the network to separate live real-time web traffic from background prefetching traffic which may&lt;br/&gt;receive lower priority. The project will use the PI's existing evaluation testbed for implementing&lt;br/&gt;and evaluating architectural prototypes.</AbstractNarration>
