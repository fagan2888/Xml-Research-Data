    <AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this international conference entitled "Primate Origins" is to assemble a series of experts who are currently performing novel research concerning the unique adaptive characteristics of the Order Primates (the taxonomic group to which humans, apes, monkeys, and prosimians belong). Primates are distinguished from other mammals by several traits of the skull and limbs, most notably the opposable big toe, nails instead of claws on the digits, larger brains, reduction of the organs responsible for the sense of smell, and larger more convergent eyes which are protected by additional bone around the sockets. This conference will provide a long-overdue comprehensive reassessment of the adaptations of the first primates utilizing the expertise of both paleontologists and those who study living primates. We will provide the first comprehensive analysis of the adaptive significance of pronounced morphological and behavioral transformations during this important and interesting stage of primate evolution which will also facilitate a fuller understanding of groundwork for the transformations that took place during the later evolution of higher primate.</AbstractNarration>
