    <AbstractNarration>0102495&lt;br/&gt;Robles&lt;br/&gt;This project would establish a structured undergraduate mentoring program in environmental biology at a minority serving university - California State University, Los Angeles (CSLA). It would strengthen collaboration among faculty, their supporting research institution, and a network of off-campus partners devoted to environmental science education. A unifying science theme, "acquisition and use of spatial information in field studies," provides a focus for curricular and research activities. Student programs may include special courses in Geographic Information Systems, field instrumentation, computer modeling, molecular genetic population differentiation, as well as more traditional environmental science offerings. Students would gain research experience in interdisciplinary teams of mentors, graduate students, and collaborating scientists. Students will rotate and adopt one of three teams: (1) Molecular Genetics of Populations (2) Perturbations of the Terrestrial Carbon Cycle, and (3) Models of Marine Benthic Populations. Program activities are staged over two to three years in phases: (I) Orientation - introduction to the environmental science community and encouragement in basic scholarship, (II) In-Depth Training - emphasis on advanced research skills, and (III) Culmination - presentation of scientific findings and preparation for graduate school. Additional activities include internships with agency partners, intensive "field immersion experiences," and mentoring by accomplished role models. An ethics component will feature seminars and discussions with local and national ethicists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mentoring program is based on the fact that students' motivation is crucial to their success; therefore, all activities seek to build student confidence and capability. Motivation will be heightened by imparting awareness of scientists' social responsibilities and by fostering an appreciation for the contribution students from underrepresented groups can make. By promoting on and off campus educational partnerships, the project will positively affect the future of environmental science education at CSLA, and benefit students beyond the cohort of exemplary UMEB undergraduate fellows.</AbstractNarration>
