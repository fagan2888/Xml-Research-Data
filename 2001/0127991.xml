    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop magnetorheological (MR) fluids using nano-sized magnetic particles. MR fluids are a family of smart materials that have the unique ability to undergo rapid, reversible, and significant changes in their rheological properties on application of an external magnetic field. These unique properties make MR fluids very attractive for such applications as shock and vibration control, brakes, and precision finishing technology. However, problems persist with commercial MR fluids due to the relatively large magnetic particles used (typically 3-5 um). These problems include poor stability against sedimentation and redispersibility. In this Phase I project, nanosized magnetic powders will be developed to produce MR fluids with improved stability and redispersibility. This will be followed by optimization of synthesis, characterization, and testing of the MR fluids. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project are expected to include electrically controllable dampers, brakes, clutches, engine mounts, throttle valves, cross steppers and precision finishing technology.</AbstractNarration>
