    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proof-of-concept project is developing a combination of multimedia-based and traditional educational materials for an Introductory Calculus course. It is also extending the current practice of student portfolios into electronic portfolios (or e-folios) in Calculus I, and for presentation of student mathematics research. Building on the successful programs of Multimedia Programming and Design and Calculus Reform, the Computer Information System and Mathematics Departments are collaborating to produce materials that utilize multimedia presentation methods to develop a set of educational materials that integrate multimedia technology for enhancing Calculus I. These materials use techniques such as three-dimensional visualization, animation, and dynamic problem solving to facilitate students' comprehension of complex topics. Activities include product design sessions and training workshops to facilitate the creation of educational materials to be published on the web. These materials include electronic class notes, laboratory manuals, research problem sets instructors' guide and various exercises, and assessment tools with links to appropriate sources of information and software tools and that enable students to learn through a hands-on problem solving approach. This project extends this innovative learning model by facilitating the integration of Multimedia technology into Student Research Projects. The students are being introduced to Multimedia Technology and can author their e-folios and publish their findings on the World Wide Web through exposure to the educational material and presentation techniques introduced in the classroom. This in turn provides students with knowledge and experience in Multimedia and World Wide Web, industries which are currently experiencing a tremendous demand for skilled workers.</AbstractNarration>
