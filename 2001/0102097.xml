    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "The Origin and Early Evolution of Apicomplexans." Apicomplexans are microbial parasites that appear to have descended from phototrophic dinoflagellates. "Aseptate gregarines" are apicomplexans that inhabit marine worms and possess many ancestral features. Moreover, many taxa of uncertain phylogenetic position possess apicomplexan-like characteristics. Morphological and molecular phylogenetics of these "enigmatic taxa" are being investigated and are expected to throw light on apicomplexan origins and the evolution of novel characters.</AbstractNarration>
