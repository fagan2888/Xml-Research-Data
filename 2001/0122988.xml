    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;This program provides finical aid and academic support for talented low-income students majoring in Computer Science, Engineering or Mathematics. There is a strong recruitment plan for Hispanic students that attend surrounding high schools and community colleges. The program actively seeks Hispanic students but does not discriminate against other minority or non-minority students. The program has developed partnerships between Coral Park Senior High School (CPSHS) and Miami Dade Community College (MDCC) that helps to identify candidates in terms of need, well roundedness and scholarship. However, the program is not limited to these students. Indeed, information of the program is mailed to all the Miami Dade High Schools and Florida Community Colleges. The goal of the program is for the entering first year students to graduate with a Bachelors degree in 4 years and for the community college transfer students to finish their Bachelors degree in 2 years. A counseling program is in place with the purpose of providing the scholars with the adequate support mechanisms to make the above goals successful. As part of the retention effort, tutorial assistance and an internship program are in place. There also is a group of specialists to assist the scholars in coping with the everyday problems they face during their college experience.</AbstractNarration>
