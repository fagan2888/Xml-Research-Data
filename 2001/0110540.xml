    <AbstractNarration>0110540&lt;br/&gt;Langeland&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the proposed study is to take advantage of the unique&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic position of the lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, to address&lt;br/&gt;fundamental issues of developmental and molecular evolution in the&lt;br/&gt;vertebrate lineage. Lampreys are the simplest extant vertebrates, situated&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetically between the cephalochordates (represented by amphioxus)&lt;br/&gt;and the gnathostomes (represented by mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians,&lt;br/&gt;and fish). Morphologically, lampreys share several characteristics with&lt;br/&gt;their gnathostome sister group, including multiple brain divisions, neural&lt;br/&gt;crest and its derivatives, neurogenic placodes, pharyngeal arches, and a&lt;br/&gt;cartilaginous endoskeleton, but they lack jaws and paired appendages and&lt;br/&gt;retain a relatively simple axial morphology. Genetically, lampreys also&lt;br/&gt;appear to be less complex than gnathostomes, having undergone fewer&lt;br/&gt;duplications of developmental regulatory genes. Lampreys are thus a&lt;br/&gt;perfect system with which to investigate developmental and molecular events&lt;br/&gt;associated with early vertebrate evolution. Dr. Langeland has led in&lt;br/&gt;recent efforts to establish lampreys as a viable system for comparative&lt;br/&gt;developmental genetics. There are two basic thrusts to this proposal: 1)&lt;br/&gt;to use gene expression studies in lamprey embryos to investigate&lt;br/&gt;fundamental aspects of the evolution of vertebrate head patterning, and 2)&lt;br/&gt;to use gene phylogeny studies to test whether duplications of select&lt;br/&gt;regulatory genes accompanied vertebrate origins. The Langeland laboratory&lt;br/&gt;will clone and characterize members of the goosecoid, Emx, and snail/Slug&lt;br/&gt;gene families in P. marinus. These genes are excellent markers for three&lt;br/&gt;key developmental innovations that accompanied vertebrate origins: the&lt;br/&gt;establishment of the head organizer, the elaboration of rostral brain&lt;br/&gt;patterning, and the acquisition and diversification of cephalic neural&lt;br/&gt;crest. Comparative expression analyses of these genes during lamprey&lt;br/&gt;embryogenesis will allow more precise reconstruction of developmental&lt;br/&gt;events associated with vertebrate origins.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, determination of the copy number of these genes in lampreys,&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of their phylogenetic relationships with their gnathostome and&lt;br/&gt;protochordate homologs, will provide important evidence concerning whether&lt;br/&gt;widespread gene duplications, or even whole genome duplication, facilitated&lt;br/&gt;vertebrate origins. This research will take place at a four-year&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate liberal arts college. Extensive involvement of&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates in all phases of the project will help maintain the strong&lt;br/&gt;record of the host institution and of the principal investigator in&lt;br/&gt;integrating research with teaching, and in preparing future Ph.D.s in the&lt;br/&gt;life sciences.</AbstractNarration>
