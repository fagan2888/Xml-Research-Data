    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I will develop new implantable electrodes for use in neurological sensing and stimulation. Neuroprostheses have been traditionally fabricated from metals such as stainless steel. The effectiveness of metallic implant devices can be compromised by exposure to the corrosive physiologic environment. Material property mismatches between body tissues and metals can also reduce the tolerability of these devices, especially of those used around muscle tissue. Plastics are finding increasing application in implants due to their more natural stress transfer properties, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. The proposed research objective is to develop a novel molecularly ordered silicone elastomer that offers tailorable mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility, physiological stability and high electrical conductivity. Conducting polymers will be incorporated in a polysiloxane matrix to yield ordered structures for maximizing conductivity while preserving the desired elastomer properties. Conductive composites will be prepared and tested for electrical conductivity, mechanical properties, physiological durability and suitability for implantable devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal commercial application of this project is in the neuroprosthesis device market. Successful development of non-metallic electrodes having high electrical conductivity and improved biomechanical properties will have significant potential in this market. Other potential product areas include anticorrosion coatings and electrical shielding materials.</AbstractNarration>
