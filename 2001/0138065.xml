    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0138065&lt;br/&gt;Binhai Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, we investigate a three-dimensional geometric &lt;br/&gt;problem that originated in neural maps, which model the &lt;br/&gt;motions of neurons so as to understand the human behavior. &lt;br/&gt;The problem is defined as follows: given a neuron, which is &lt;br/&gt;modeled as a polyhedron, compute a minimum set of (minimal) &lt;br/&gt;cylindrical segments to approximate the neuron. We plan to &lt;br/&gt;design a good approximation for this problem (i.e., the error &lt;br/&gt;between the cylindrical segments and the neuron is small).&lt;br/&gt;We also plan to have a good implementation, build a prototype &lt;br/&gt;system, and perform extensive empirical studies. Practically, &lt;br/&gt;a solution to this problem will have a great impact in &lt;br/&gt;computational biology. Theoretically, this problem generalizes &lt;br/&gt;the problem of finding a single line stabbing a set of balls &lt;br/&gt;in 3D (and has never been seriously studied to the best of our knowledge).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modeling the motions of human neurons is an important problem &lt;br/&gt;in biology, especially in understanding human behavior under &lt;br/&gt;different circumstances. To do that, we first need to model &lt;br/&gt;a single neuron, which is very much like a tree-shaped &lt;br/&gt;polyhedron, using a set of cylindrical segments. Different&lt;br/&gt;cylindrical segments of different radii have different &lt;br/&gt;functionality, so the union of the cylindrical segments &lt;br/&gt;should be as close to the neuron as possible. In practice &lt;br/&gt;this problem is estimated manually by technicians in&lt;br/&gt;the computational biology community. The process is &lt;br/&gt;time-consuming and error-prone. Our research will focus &lt;br/&gt;on automating this process with computers and a successful &lt;br/&gt;solution will have deep influence in the computational &lt;br/&gt;biology community. We will train two graduate students&lt;br/&gt;throughout this project.</AbstractNarration>
