    <AbstractNarration>Molecular techniques are essential to some of today's most advanced and progressive research in physical anthropology. The broad applicability of molecular methodologies, combined with improved accessibility, means that invaluable training and research opportunities now exist for students and researchers. This award provides funds for an Automated DNA Analysis System in order to develop a molecular anthropology training and research program at the University of Florida (UF). The Department of Anthropology at UF is expanding its Bioanthropology program with an emphasis on developing a core series of graduate-level laboratory courses. Furthermore, the expansion of the Bioanthropology program has stimulated the development of several collaborative research and training projects within the Department of Anthropology and throughout the university. Dr. Mulligan has an active research program in which molecular techniques, specifically DNA sequence and fragment analysis, play a central role. A total of eight projects are currently funded (partially or fully). The requested instrumentation will provide improved accessibility of the technology to researchers and students with minimal experience in molecular methodology. The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at UF recognizes the merit of this opportunity and has agreed to match external funding obtained for the acquisition of an Automated DNA Analysis System.</AbstractNarration>
