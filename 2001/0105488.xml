    <AbstractNarration>This research involves developing new connections between the areas of&lt;br/&gt;machine learning, on-line algorithms, and optimization, and using&lt;br/&gt;these connections to address fundamental problems in all&lt;br/&gt;three areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In machine learning, one focus of this research is how to best combine&lt;br/&gt;a small sample of labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data&lt;br/&gt;in order to produce high quality predictions. This type of problem&lt;br/&gt;has become especially important given the explosion of data now&lt;br/&gt;available over the web. This research is exploring how techniques&lt;br/&gt;such as network flow and graph cuts from the optimization literature&lt;br/&gt;can be used to provide a new means of attack, and how to best make a&lt;br/&gt;number of design choices that arise in this approach. Another basic&lt;br/&gt;question this work investigates is what kinds of concepts can be&lt;br/&gt;automatically learned in the presence of highly noisy data, and to&lt;br/&gt;what extent substantially new types of algorithms may be possible.&lt;br/&gt;The PI recently gave the first algorithm to learn a class of concepts&lt;br/&gt;in the presence of noise that is provably not learnable by a wide&lt;br/&gt;class of techniques known as Statistical Query methods. The current&lt;br/&gt;research aims to expand on this work and explore the extent to which&lt;br/&gt;it can be pushed much further. The types of learning problems being&lt;br/&gt;studied have close connections to problems of decoding random linear&lt;br/&gt;codes and finding approximate shortest lattice vectors that arise in&lt;br/&gt;cryptography. Improvements to the learning algorithms should impact&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of those problems as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another major thrust of this research is the use of techniques from&lt;br/&gt;machine learning to address problems in online algorithms. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the highly-developed "weighted experts" technology in&lt;br/&gt;machine learning suggests new approaches for combining multiple online&lt;br/&gt;algorithms that may simplify a number of longstanding open problems.&lt;br/&gt;This work is studying the extent to which this connection can provide&lt;br/&gt;insight into several basic questions, such as dynamic optimality in&lt;br/&gt;search trees and the weighted caching problem. Finally, this research&lt;br/&gt;is also studying a number of basic approximability questions, as well&lt;br/&gt;as exploring new frameworks for the analysis of local search&lt;br/&gt;techniques.</AbstractNarration>
