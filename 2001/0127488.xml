    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project builds upon the successful regional Shodor Computational Science Institute&lt;br/&gt;(SCSI) to create a National Computational Science Institute (NCSI). Reaching more than&lt;br/&gt;1000 undergraduate faculty per year for three years, NCSI offers a proven, modular set&lt;br/&gt;of in-person, video-conferenced, and web-accessible workshops, seminars, and support&lt;br/&gt;activities to introduce the hands-on use of computational science, numerical models and&lt;br/&gt;data visualization tools across the undergraduate curriculum. This project represents a &lt;br/&gt;partnership with the Education, Outreach and Training Partnership for Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Computational Infrastructure, the National Computational Science Education Consortium,&lt;br/&gt;the Burroughs Wellcome Fund, and more than two dozen undergraduate institutions, high&lt;br/&gt;performance computing centers and vendors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target audience for NCSI is teams of faculty from predominantly undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;institutions, minority serving institutions, and community colleges whose students are&lt;br/&gt;either the next generation of scientists and engineers, the next generation of K-12 teachers,&lt;br/&gt;or both. NCSI participants then assist other faculty on their own campuses and at neighboring&lt;br/&gt;institutions to introduce computational science in their own classes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main work of NCSI is accomplished through three synergistic but distinct efforts that&lt;br/&gt;can be modeled as PULL, PUSH, and PERMEATE. Regionally distributed workshops PULL &lt;br/&gt;faculty within a reasonable travel distance for a week of intense interdisciplinary training,&lt;br/&gt;collaboration, and curriculum development in computational science. Participants explore&lt;br/&gt;the use of modeling and visualization tools in existing courses, while stimulating creation&lt;br/&gt;of new courses and promoting new modes of undergraduate research. NCSI staff and&lt;br/&gt;participants proactively PUSH computational science education onto the agendas of&lt;br/&gt;numerous annual meetings of professional and discipline-specific societies, by offering&lt;br/&gt;workshops, conducting tutorials, presenting papers and posters, and serving on program&lt;br/&gt;committees. To sustain these efforts, NCSI PERMEATEs on-going and proposed&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate curriculum efforts providing interdisciplinary and discipline specific&lt;br/&gt;web-accessible courses for faculty enhancement, and resources for interactive exploration&lt;br/&gt;including curriculum, problem-based modeling modules, tools, and tutorials, leveraging&lt;br/&gt;Shodor's award-winning Computational Science Education Reference Desk.</AbstractNarration>
