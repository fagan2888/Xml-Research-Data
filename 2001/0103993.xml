    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0103993&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A general problem in Riemannian geometry is to find and describe manifolds&lt;br/&gt;that admit a complete Riemannian metric of positive sectional curvature.&lt;br/&gt;If there is no positive lower bound on the curvature, then the manifold is&lt;br/&gt;known to be diffeomorphic to Euclidean space, by the Cheeger-Gromoll-Meyer&lt;br/&gt;Soul theorem. In the class of closed, positively curved manifolds, there&lt;br/&gt;are few restrictions, most of which are classical, such as the&lt;br/&gt;Bonnet-Myers and Synge theorems. For closed, simply connected manifolds,&lt;br/&gt;there is essentially just Gromov's theorem bounding the total Betti number&lt;br/&gt;in a given dimension. Given that there are few known obstructions, it is&lt;br/&gt;frustrating that the set of known examples, although infinite, is&lt;br/&gt;relatively small. My research is concerned with understanding the geometry&lt;br/&gt;and topology of the known examples. More specifically, the goals are: 1)&lt;br/&gt;to attempt to find new examples of positively curved manifolds by studying&lt;br/&gt;more general metrics on biquotients (in collaboration with J.-H.&lt;br/&gt;Eschenburg), 2) to compute the isometry groups for the known cohomogeneity&lt;br/&gt;one manifolds of positive curvature and 3) to see whether the&lt;br/&gt;7-dimensional Berger space is diffeomorphic to a 3-sphere bundle over the&lt;br/&gt;4-sphere (in collaboration with N. Kitchloo).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry arose from trying to understand curvature. &lt;br/&gt;Intuitively, we know that tabletops are flat while basketballs and saddles&lt;br/&gt;are curved. Geometers are able to quantify curvature precisely and it&lt;br/&gt;provides a numerical invariant that helps distinguish objects. For&lt;br/&gt;instance, the surface of a doughnut and the surface of a coffee cup have&lt;br/&gt;the same nature i.e., they are both surfaces with one hole, but they are&lt;br/&gt;shaped differently. On the other hand, the surface of a ball (usually&lt;br/&gt;called a sphere) is different in shape and nature from the surface of a&lt;br/&gt;doughnut (usually called a torus). How can we be sure that this is always&lt;br/&gt;the case? One may wonder if it is possible to deform the sphere suitably&lt;br/&gt;so that we might end up with the torus. A sphere has positive curvature&lt;br/&gt;everywhere while it can be shown that no matter what shape a torus takes,&lt;br/&gt;it will always have zero curvature somewhere. This tells us that the two&lt;br/&gt;objects are somehow fundamentally different from each other. Differential&lt;br/&gt;geometry is also the language used to express the general theory of&lt;br/&gt;relativity, our best theoretical description of gravity and its effects on&lt;br/&gt;the universe. In general relativity, a vacuous space-time universe would&lt;br/&gt;be inherently flat. This idealized state is warped by the presence of&lt;br/&gt;masses or energy, Thus, gravity is the curvature in space-time, and by&lt;br/&gt;understanding the geometry of Lorentzian space-time, one may some day&lt;br/&gt;understand the shape of the universe. My work involves the study of&lt;br/&gt;positively curved objects in higher dimensions. This is part of trying to&lt;br/&gt;understand how the structure imposed by curvature (geometry) is essential&lt;br/&gt;to understanding the nature (topology) of an object and vice versa.</AbstractNarration>
