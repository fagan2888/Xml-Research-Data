    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is improving an upper-division advanced physics lab course through the adaptation and implementation of a cohesive set of experiments built upon digital imaging array detectors. These experiments were originally designed as part of a lab course in optical astronomy instrumentation at Caltech, which was funded by NSF's Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) program (Award No. 9250725).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The six experiments being adapted focus on geometric optics and aberrations, CCD electronics, CCD characteristics, fundamentals of spectroscopy, applications of spectroscopy, and imaging using an IR array camera. These experiments give students hands-on experience with IR and CCD array cameras and detectors, optics, and spectrographs as tools for making experimental measurements. By analyzing the collected digital data, students gain competence in the areas of analog-to-digital conversion, computer data acquisition, statistics, and modern computer image-processing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new equipment is also being used in a chemistry course on instrumental analysis; in physical chemistry lab experiments pertaining to spectroscopy; and in introductory physics and astronomy courses to demonstrate concepts such as visible light, infrared radiation, and temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Loyola Marymount University serves a diverse student population. Typically, about one third of the students enrolled in the advanced physics lab course are members of underrepresented groups, and 65% of the students in introductory astronomy are female. As the investigators implement the new equipment in these courses, they are not only improving the quality of the educational experience for all students but also attempting to excite women and ethnic minorities about pursuing careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of assessing the effectiveness of the improved advanced physics lab course, at the end of the course, students are giving demonstrations based on the experiments, and explaining the physics involved, to high school physics classes. The feedback from the high school teachers and students provides a gauge of how well the LMU students have grasped the advanced lab material.</AbstractNarration>
