    <AbstractNarration>Schloerb, F. Peter&lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts Amherst&lt;br/&gt;Astronomy Research at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory at the University of Massachusetts is a group of scientists and engineers who work together in support of a research program in millimeter-wave astronomy. The FCRAO program emphasizes three principal areas: (1) astronomical research; (2) development of state-of-the-art instrumentation; and (3) training of graduate and undergraduate students in observational astronomy and astronomical instrumentation. The program is currently known for its operation of a 14m diameter millimeter-wave telescope in Massachusetts. However, in order to remain at the forefront of research, the Observatory is participating with the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica, y Electronica (INAOE) in the construction, in Mexico, of a 50m diameter Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT), to be completed in 2004. The research to be undertaken involves continued operations of the FCRAO 14m telescope for scientific observations, and the initial stages of transition to the new facility. The latter includes development and testing of new LMT instrumentation (a wide-band correlator, a 1mm SIS receiver, a wavefront sensing system for pointing corrections, and a holography system), and work on antenna monitor and control systems.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
