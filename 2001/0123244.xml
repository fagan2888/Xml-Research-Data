    <AbstractNarration>Ilisagvik College in Barrow, Alaska is the lead college in the Consortium for Alaska &lt;br/&gt;Native Higher Education, Inc. (CANHE), a non-profit group of Alaska Native organizations&lt;br/&gt;creating and supporting new Alaska Native-serving colleges in Alaska. CANHE was&lt;br/&gt;established, in part, because only 4% of Alaska Natives (1990) have achieved &lt;br/&gt;baccalaureate degrees. Alaska Natives are poorly represented as students in &lt;br/&gt;Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology (SMET) programs in Alaska's&lt;br/&gt;universities and colleges, as teachers in the Alaska schools, and in the occupations&lt;br/&gt;requiring these skills. Data on Alaska Native higher education achievement is not&lt;br/&gt;well collected. It is obvious to Alaska natives, however, that different techniques&lt;br/&gt;must be used to attract and retain Native and rural students in SMET programs than&lt;br/&gt;those used for years by the state university. Ilisagvik will serve as the lead and &lt;br/&gt;mentor institution for the planning and assessment effort over the10 months of &lt;br/&gt;the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ilisagvik will engage a project manager to conduct the assessment. A CANHE member&lt;br/&gt;task force will create a mission statement defining the planning goals, priorities&lt;br/&gt;and project milestones. An external advisory board will be chaired by Dr. Edna&lt;br/&gt;MacLean, the president of Ilisagvik College, and will review the planning effort and&lt;br/&gt;evaluate the progress. The task force and manager will gather data from each of the&lt;br/&gt;six members and examine their missions, their long-term goals and priorities. The&lt;br/&gt;regional needs and strengths will become part of the CANHE SMET master plan which&lt;br/&gt;will include the colleges' resources, governance, culture, technology requirements, &lt;br/&gt;and funding strategies. The plan will include assessment of faculty needed and the&lt;br/&gt;skills available for staff instruction, and inventory the technology requirements&lt;br/&gt;and the infrastructure support needed in each region. Beyond the specific benefits&lt;br/&gt;of the assessment to Ilisagvik College, the benefits will multiply by involving all&lt;br/&gt;the CANHE members in the process and the ultimate implementation of the plan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group will design practical cost-effective methods to create, expand and &lt;br/&gt;collaboratively improve SMET programs for the dispersed potential student body &lt;br/&gt;including collaboration with other regions, some centralizing support activities,&lt;br/&gt; and integrating incentives to be involved for faculty and students. Given the vast &lt;br/&gt;roadless distances between communities, the primitive state of rural Alaska&lt;br/&gt;telecommunications and information infrastructure and the high cost of such&lt;br/&gt;services when available, there are numerous problems of distance delivery to&lt;br/&gt;be identified, understood and resolved. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ilisagvik developed a new Information Technology A.A.S. curriculum and acquired &lt;br/&gt;some of the infrastructure to carry out the classes through previous funding from &lt;br/&gt;NSF, the American Association of Community Colleges, the M. J. Murdock Foundation, &lt;br/&gt;and the Microsoft Corporation. Other programs are being developed by CANHE members. &lt;br/&gt;These assets can be shared across the state to improve SMET delivery. Collectively &lt;br/&gt;the colleges can register a greater number of students for these courses from the &lt;br/&gt;multi-regional Native student body and deliver them with a smaller number of&lt;br/&gt;faculty also taking administrative advantages of cross-registration benefits.&lt;br/&gt;The data, assessment, and draft plan will be reviewed with the board and&lt;br/&gt;organizational leadership of each regional colleges prior to adoption to affirm, &lt;br/&gt;and modified if required, so that it addresses the needs, direction and resources &lt;br/&gt;of each region.</AbstractNarration>
