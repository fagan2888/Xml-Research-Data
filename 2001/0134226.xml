    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and educational program consists of developing a multi-scale&lt;br/&gt;experimental program to study the mechanics of fracture in elastic-plastic&lt;br/&gt;materials. The research is intended to complement and guide multi-scale&lt;br/&gt;simulations of fracture in elastic-plastic materials. The experiments will&lt;br/&gt;focus on understanding the behavior of cracks that exist along the grain&lt;br/&gt;boundary of symmetric tilt bicrystals of either pure aluminum or pure&lt;br/&gt;copper. In such a specimen there is a well known, but poorly understood,&lt;br/&gt;phenomenon known as directional dependence of fracture. If a crack is&lt;br/&gt;introduced along the grain boundary, the amount it grows macroscopically&lt;br/&gt;depends upon the direction within the grain boundary that it propagates. A&lt;br/&gt;judicious choice of crystallographic orientation and loading techniques&lt;br/&gt;will ensure that the mechanical properties at the macroscopic length scale&lt;br/&gt;are identical for both cracks, yet the amount of macroscopic growth will&lt;br/&gt;be different. Thus the explanation for the directional dependence must&lt;br/&gt;depend upon deformation mechanisms at the smaller length scales as well as&lt;br/&gt;the interaction of the deformation mechanisms across length scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the experiments, cracks will be introduced and propagated in opposite&lt;br/&gt;directions within the grain boundary of symmetric tilt bicrystals. The&lt;br/&gt;structure of the asymptotic deformation fields will be measured under&lt;br/&gt;plane strain conditions to investigate a certain type of strain&lt;br/&gt;discontinuity, known as kink shear discontinuity, that is predicted by&lt;br/&gt;theory and observed in some materials under certain conditions. The&lt;br/&gt;existence of kink shear discontinuities depends critically upon plastic&lt;br/&gt;constitutive relations at very small length scales. The next set of&lt;br/&gt;experiments will be to measure the directional dependence of fracture&lt;br/&gt;under both a monotonic and cyclic loading to document the degree of crack&lt;br/&gt;growth in different directions along a grain boundary. The final set of&lt;br/&gt;experiments will measure the lattice curvature of the crystal close to the&lt;br/&gt;crack tip to ascertain the density of geometrically necessary dislocations&lt;br/&gt;which play an important role in strain gradient plasticity. All the&lt;br/&gt;experiments will be simulated with the discrete dislocation plasticity&lt;br/&gt;technique in collaboration with other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component is to reach out to secondary schools in the&lt;br/&gt;neighborhoods around Columbia University, particularly in Harlem, to&lt;br/&gt;develop a science module that is suitable for students in their final two&lt;br/&gt;years of high school with the goal of inspiring them to continue their&lt;br/&gt;educations. The module will demonstrate that materials are made of&lt;br/&gt;discrete atoms by discussing the phenomenon of diffraction. To do so, the&lt;br/&gt;students will first gain intuition into the diffraction phenomenon by&lt;br/&gt;identifying and matching symmetries in diffraction gratings and the&lt;br/&gt;related diffraction patterns that are created with a standard laser&lt;br/&gt;pointer. Then the crystallographic aspects of face-centered cubic metals&lt;br/&gt;and the symmetries of a cube will be introduced. Finally the students will&lt;br/&gt;be asked to identify the two-fold, three-fold, and four-fold rotation&lt;br/&gt;symmetries in separate Laue back reflection x-ray diffraction patterns and&lt;br/&gt;correlate the patterns with the crystallographic orientations that exhibit&lt;br/&gt;the same sets of symmetries. Thus the students will identify the&lt;br/&gt;symmetries inherent in crystals without having to understand any of the&lt;br/&gt;details of the diffraction process.</AbstractNarration>
