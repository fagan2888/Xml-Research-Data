    <AbstractNarration>0115575&lt;br/&gt;Dzidzienyo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a second international workshop on the experiences and challenges of both US and African power industry restructuring activities. It will strengthen and broaden the scope of power restructuring technical, economic and legal activities. The experiences and lessons from the implementation of restructuring and privatization worldwide will be directed towards the enhancement of future activities in the energy sector. The workshop will involve energy experts, researchers, university scholars and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The emergence of a competitive utility environment presents new planning, operation, reliability, and costing issues that constitute new challenges to power system managers, practicing engineers, researchers and developers. There are already conferences, workshops, symposiums and studies to address several of these important issues. However, there is a lack of dialogue and a lack of visionary goals towards identification of the most effective methods to deal with obstacles such as computational challenges, institutional barriers, policies, etc. In order to overcome these obstacles, the proposed international workshop in Abauja, Nigeria is aimed at synthesizing ideas, setting directions and developing joint projects to assist the participating countries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to organize a focused workshop between US and Sub-Saharan Africa countries to address the following issues: promotion of effective planning, optimal strategies and paradigms for competitive power systems: development of dialogues through open exchange on different power system structures, experiences and challenges in restructuring; evaluation of available computational techniques to address technical challenges in a restructured environment, policy analysis and social sector issues; and to promote cooperation between US and African utilities/vendors, universities, and policy makers in the energy sector to address the issues: economics of restructuring, incentives for capital investment, congestion management, distributed generation (DG) in a restructured utility environment, reliability assessment technology, costing and pricing of the power market, collection and billing issues, human resources/training issues, policies, legal concerns, and environmental concerns.</AbstractNarration>
