    <AbstractNarration>Except for a small number of human pathogens, microbial genome efforts have steered clear of the diverse world of protozoans, many of which are important agricultural parasites. Of particular interest are the Microsporidia, which by eukaryotic standards have remarkably small genomes. Since they infect most invertebrate taxa and all classes of vertebrates, their impact on agriculture and fisheries is significant. They either cause disease or can serve as bio-control agents. These same organisms have attracted the interests of biologists and molecular evolutionists. They offer excellent models for studying interactions between the genomes of a host and an obligate, intracellular parasite. But molecular phylogenetic analyses point towards a confused evolutionary history. To advance knowledge of these unusual microbes and to address the ever-increasing demand for researchers broadly trained in genome sciences, the genome of the microsporidian Nosema locustae will be sequenced to closure and a comprehensive course in genome science will be established to provide broad-based training in high throughput sequencing techniques and bioinformatics. By integrating this course with the N. locustae project, nearly 100 students will be trained in all aspects of genomics. Although this model for research and training could be applied to other microbial groups, Microsporidia were selected because of their impact upon agriculture, their enigmatic character in molecular evolution studies and what they may reveal about interactions between the genomes of hosts and obligate intracellular parasites. Sequence data (3X and higher coverage, monthly updates and annotation) will be available to the research community on the Marine Biological Laboratory's web server (www.mbl.edu). This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems</AbstractNarration>
