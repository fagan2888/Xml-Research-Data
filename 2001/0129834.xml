    <AbstractNarration>Chabot Space and Science Center is developing and organizing a major traveling exhibit called "Dragon Skies: Astronomical Instruments of Imperial China." The exhibit will consist of nine Chinese astronomical instruments, dating between 1439 and 1744, as well as 25 smaller artifacts. In addition, a variety of interpretive materials and activities will be developed to enhance the exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI, Michael Reynolds, has visited the Ancient Beijing Observatory and begun initial conversations with the staff there, resulting in tentative collaboration agreements. Subsequent to that visit, the Ancient Beijing Observatory has already determined which original instruments will be able to travel, has replicated several exhibits, and has compiled a collection of additional artifacts that will enhance the exhibit. The planning phase will be carried out by staff from Chabot, the Beijing Ancient Observatory, the Chinese Astronomical Society, and a team of advisors. Planning activities will include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Decide which aspects of exhibit development will be taken on by each partner.&lt;br/&gt;Determine what ancillary materials will need to be developed.&lt;br/&gt;Establish what interactive activities, such as hands-on activities or computer kiosks, will enhance the project.&lt;br/&gt;Determine what multimedia programs, such as an audio tour or planetarium shows, will increase the impact of the exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;Determine the translation needs for the exhibit and for the supplemental materials and programs.&lt;br/&gt;Arrange the logistics for the traveling exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;Establish criteria for venues that might display the exhibit and identify potential sites.</AbstractNarration>
