    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will continue his research in enumerative and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic combinatorics. He feels that there are many opportunities&lt;br/&gt;for strengthening the myriad connections between combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;other branches of mathematics. He will investigate how recent&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in the theory of total positivity can be applied to open&lt;br/&gt;problems concerning such topics as counting faces in cubical polytopes&lt;br/&gt;and counting stable sets in clawfree graphs. The investigator will&lt;br/&gt;also continue his research on the combinatorial properties of convex&lt;br/&gt;polytopes that have arisen in such areas as statistical inference and&lt;br/&gt;the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;he will investigate further some convex polytopes related to Kostant's&lt;br/&gt;partition function. He will in addition pursue a number of&lt;br/&gt;miscellaneous problems arising in the work of Kac, Kontsevich,&lt;br/&gt;Varchenko, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of combinatorics was first systematically investigated in&lt;br/&gt;the 1960's and only recently has reached a high level of maturity. It&lt;br/&gt;is an area of mathematics that has close connections with many other&lt;br/&gt;subjects, ranging from algebra, geometry, and statistics within&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, andcomputer science, high-energy physics, chemistry, and&lt;br/&gt;most recently biology without. The investigator's primary interest is&lt;br/&gt;the development of connections between combinatorics and other areas&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics. He will investigate a number of problems that would&lt;br/&gt;continue the development of the connections between combinatorics and&lt;br/&gt;other branches of mathematics and that would lead to the development&lt;br/&gt;of tools that could be used by scientists outside of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
