    <AbstractNarration>Buechler's proposed research is to extend the scope of&lt;br/&gt;geometrical stability theory outside of the context of a&lt;br/&gt;first-order theory. His test project is an analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;geometries induced by bounded linear operators on a Hilbert space&lt;br/&gt;and more complex structures like von Neumann algebras. With his&lt;br/&gt;student Berenstein Buechler has shown that many self-adjoint&lt;br/&gt;operators induce dependence relations satisfying all of the&lt;br/&gt;conditions of the dividing dependence relation. Buechler hopes&lt;br/&gt;that the dividing dependence relation will give insight into the&lt;br/&gt;structure of von Neumann algebras. In another project Buechler&lt;br/&gt;will investigate "dividing relative to a closure operator". While&lt;br/&gt;this study is analogous to the study of p-simple types in a&lt;br/&gt;superstable theory it presents dramatically different results&lt;br/&gt;when the original theory is not simple and the closure operator&lt;br/&gt;is chosen creatively. Applications to metric spaces and Vaught's&lt;br/&gt;conjecture are expected. Buechler will also study a class of&lt;br/&gt;scale-free networks with model-theoretic methods. Scale-free&lt;br/&gt;networks are ubiquitous in nature and technology. Random graph&lt;br/&gt;theorists have discovered some of their properties, such as the&lt;br/&gt;degree functions. However, techniques for building models are&lt;br/&gt;limited. Model theorists have developed techniques for building&lt;br/&gt;graphs that are random relative to some constraints. These&lt;br/&gt;methods may lend themselves to building scale-free graphs with&lt;br/&gt;specified parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Frequently a significant advancement in science occurs when a&lt;br/&gt;problem arising in one area is viewed from the perspective of&lt;br/&gt;another discipline. For example, problems in genetics have&lt;br/&gt;yielded to techniques from graph theory. In mathematics algebra&lt;br/&gt;has lead to great insight into geometry and knot theory.&lt;br/&gt;Buechler's specialty is model theory, a subfield of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;logic. Recently, Hrushovski applied model theory to solve&lt;br/&gt;problems in number theory. Buechler is adapting these same&lt;br/&gt;model-theoretic methods with an eye to problems in analysis and&lt;br/&gt;network theory. In analysis Buechler is looking at the&lt;br/&gt;model-theoretic content of operator theory, which has connections&lt;br/&gt;to mathematical physics. The networks Buechler will study are at&lt;br/&gt;the heart of such disparate systems as the metabolic pathways in&lt;br/&gt;a cell and the World Wide Web. Buechler will attempt to adapt&lt;br/&gt;model-theoretic techniques for constructing graphs of interest in&lt;br/&gt;pure mathematics to building models of these networks arising in&lt;br/&gt;nature and technology. Graduate students will be involved in all&lt;br/&gt;of these projects. The cross-disciplinary nature of the work will&lt;br/&gt;require the students to learn science that their normal&lt;br/&gt;curriculum would not expose them to, and to learn the value of&lt;br/&gt;viewing research in a broader context.</AbstractNarration>
