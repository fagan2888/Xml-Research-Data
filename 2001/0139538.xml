    <AbstractNarration>This project extends and continues previous work on the behavior of photons and neutrinos in a medium. Concrete calculations to be performed include: (1) The effects of the presence of a magnetic field on neutrino damping rates due to the effects of the matter-induced electromagnetic couplings of the neutrino. These effect, independent of neutrino mixing, could provide a mechanism for pulsar kicks; (2) The imaginary part of the photon self-energy (from which the photon damping rate is determined)in a medium that contains, besides the usual background of charged particles, a background of neutrinos that moves, as a whole, relative to the stationary background. This type of system has been considered in connection with energy generation mechanisms in supernova explosions; (3) The photon self-energy in a medium with an external plane wave field to study chirality effects. This is a novel application of thermal field theory methods in the context of optical and condensed matter physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The properties of photons and neutrinos in a medium, and their interactions, have been the subjects of continuous attention over the years because of they provide information about underlying processes in the environments in which they occur. This information can be important in various astrophysical and cosmological situations and in condensed matter and physical optics laboratory experiments. Apart from the details that are specific to the particular calculations and physical contexts of the calculations in this project, the treatment of these problems involve ideas, methods and techniques that can be useful in other branches of physics.</AbstractNarration>
