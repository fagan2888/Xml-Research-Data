    <AbstractNarration>The project will be devoted to the growth of III-V diluted magnetic semi-&lt;br/&gt;conductors (III-V DMSs) ternary compounds in which the anions are re-&lt;br/&gt;placed with a member of the 3d-transition group. The motivation and goal of&lt;br/&gt;the program are to explore and establish the conditions for successful growth&lt;br/&gt;of single crystals which will be materials suitable for investigating the ex-&lt;br/&gt;traordinary physical phenomena originating in the large magnetic moments&lt;br/&gt;of 3d-transition-ion (3d-TMI) and their role as acceptors. The simultaneous&lt;br/&gt;presence of free holes and the large magnetic moments provide the ingredi-&lt;br/&gt;ents for novel phenomena associated with spin-polarized charge carriers. The&lt;br/&gt;growth will initially focus on the incorporation of Mn, Co and Fe into GaAs,&lt;br/&gt;InP, GaP and InSb by thermal diffusion and melt growth. Spectroscopic&lt;br/&gt;(Fourier Transform Infrared, Raman and photoluminescence, modulated re-&lt;br/&gt;flectivity/transmission and magneto optic characterization at Purdue and&lt;br/&gt;those based on magnetic, electron-paramagnetic-resonance, and non-linear&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy by international collaborators will provide invaluable feedback&lt;br/&gt;to the crystal grower. Another collaboration will address the production of&lt;br/&gt;ultrapure starting material and fabrication of substrates suitable for molec-&lt;br/&gt;ular beam epitaxy (MBE). Basic science and device related work will be ini-&lt;br/&gt;tiated during this phase. Besides the crystal growth program implemented&lt;br/&gt;by the Co-PI, students will participate in the characterization activities and&lt;br/&gt;will acquire a healthy appreciation of growth techniques. This exposure and&lt;br/&gt;involvement will prepare them for the scientific/technical workforce of the&lt;br/&gt;21st century.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The aim of the program is to provide a "steady state-" supply of well&lt;br/&gt;characterized III-V diluted magnetic semiconductors to our ongoing research&lt;br/&gt;on collective and localized excitations of vibrational, electronic, and magnetic&lt;br/&gt;character. The access to bulk single crystals as well as material as MBE-&lt;br/&gt;grown epilayers and quantum well structures will give the participants the&lt;br/&gt;intense excitement of basic research significant in device applications.</AbstractNarration>
