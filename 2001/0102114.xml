    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Conversations between bacterium and squid: Studying the genetics behind V. fischeri's response to its symbiotic host, E. scolopes. Colonization of the squid E. scolopes by its bacterial symbiont, V. fischeri, requires the bacterial sensor kinase RscS. This research tests the hypothesis that RscS regulates other genes essential to the symbiosis by identifying these genes using a variety of molecular methods. Further, laser-scanning confocal microscopy is being used to identify where in the symbiosis process RscS is required.</AbstractNarration>
