    <AbstractNarration>In non and semiparametric inference Bickel, in collaboration with &lt;br/&gt;Ritov and others, proposes to study how an increasing but &lt;br/&gt;proportionally vanishingly small cross validation sample can be used &lt;br/&gt;systematically to optimize supervised learning (classification and &lt;br/&gt;regression) procedures, for example ADA BOOST. Further they propose &lt;br/&gt;to study a unified theory for testing of semiparametric hypotheses &lt;br/&gt;and develop efficient tests for bioequivalence. In dependent data &lt;br/&gt;models, they propose to extend previous results on Hidden Markov &lt;br/&gt;models to state space models and study how procedures obtained by &lt;br/&gt;fitting and use of approximate likelihoods such as particle filters &lt;br/&gt;behave.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and collaborators propose to analyze and develop new &lt;br/&gt;effective methods for identifying (by machine) the type of a newly &lt;br/&gt;perceived object or predicting some feature from historical &lt;br/&gt;information. This ranges from machine reading of hand written zip &lt;br/&gt;codes to predicting travel times of cars from one destination to &lt;br/&gt;another to predicting tumor type from microarray data. In a similar &lt;br/&gt;direction they propose to see how well computer simulation based &lt;br/&gt;approximations to ideal prediction methods work in very complicated &lt;br/&gt;models applying to situations such as voice recognition. Further &lt;br/&gt;they propose to study methods of inference bearing on questions such &lt;br/&gt;as whether a new drug which may be more expensive and have &lt;br/&gt;side-effects is sufficiently better than drugs currently in use to be &lt;br/&gt;authorized for distribution.</AbstractNarration>
