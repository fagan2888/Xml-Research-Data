    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: DMS-0105158&lt;br/&gt; Principal Investigator: Shubin, Carol A.&lt;br/&gt; Institution: California State University at Northridge &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal concerns the completion of several works of Thomas H. Wolff.&lt;br/&gt;Wolff's recent unfinished work concerns the restriction conjecture and&lt;br/&gt;Kakeya problem, Anderson models, and spectral gap properties of measures.&lt;br/&gt;In addition, he was in the process of writing an introductory book&lt;br/&gt;for analysis students about the restriction conjecture and Kakeya problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Wolff was a recognized leader in the field of harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;He received the 1985 Salem prize and 1999 Bocher prize for his work, as&lt;br/&gt;well as being invited to speak at the International Congress of&lt;br/&gt;Mathematicians in 1986 and 1999. Many projects were in progress at the&lt;br/&gt;time of his tragic death on July 31, 2000. The PI proposes to undertake&lt;br/&gt;supervision of their completion.</AbstractNarration>
