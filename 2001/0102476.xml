    <AbstractNarration>Gonzalez&lt;br/&gt;0102476&lt;br/&gt; The investigator studies constitutive relations for&lt;br/&gt;continuum rod models of DNA and develops new tools for analyzing&lt;br/&gt;the supercoiling and packaging of DNA and other material&lt;br/&gt;filaments. The main objectives of the project are to apply the&lt;br/&gt;theories of statistical mechanics and stochastic differential&lt;br/&gt;equations to develop constitutive relations for continuum rod&lt;br/&gt;models of DNA that are provably consistent with detailed,&lt;br/&gt;sequence-dependent structural information at the base-pair level;&lt;br/&gt;to apply the new concept of global curvature to develop a&lt;br/&gt;geometrically exact and computationally tractable formulation of&lt;br/&gt;the self-contact constraint that plays a central role in the&lt;br/&gt;supercoiling and packaging of DNA and other biological filaments;&lt;br/&gt;and to develop efficient and provably accurate computational&lt;br/&gt;methods for continuum rod models that faithfully respect global&lt;br/&gt;geometric constraints as well as qualitative features of the&lt;br/&gt;underlying system.&lt;br/&gt; Biologists and chemists now believe that the linear sequence&lt;br/&gt;of base-pairs along a DNA molecule contains not only a genetic&lt;br/&gt;code, but also a structural code that governs the global&lt;br/&gt;organization of the molecule and its susceptibility to&lt;br/&gt;interactions with other molecules. An understanding of this&lt;br/&gt;structural code requires realistic mechanical models of DNA over&lt;br/&gt;a wide range of length scales. The research project pursued by&lt;br/&gt;the investigator is aimed at the further refinement of medium- to&lt;br/&gt;long-scale continuum models. In particular, methods are&lt;br/&gt;developed for estimating local, sequence-dependent material&lt;br/&gt;parameters and for describing global, finite-thickness effects.&lt;br/&gt;Results from this research will be useful in developing a greater&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the physical and mechanical properties of DNA,&lt;br/&gt;in modeling how DNA may twist, bend and supercoil upon itself,&lt;br/&gt;and in studying how DNA and other material filaments may be&lt;br/&gt;optimally packed in confined geometries.</AbstractNarration>
