    <AbstractNarration>Professor Michael R. Detty in the Department of Chemistry at the State University of New York at Buffalo is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies incorporating organoselenides and tellurides into dendrimers. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, these compounds may function as mild oxidants. These dendrimeric catalysts show potential as environmentally friendly oxidizing agents since the use of heavy metal oxidants and elemental halogens can be replaced by hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Program, Professor Detty is developing catalysts which are mimics of halo- and thiolperoxidases, enzymes which catalyze the oxidation of halide salts and thiols, respectively. These catalysts avoid the use of poisonous reagents and therefore are potentially valuable as environmentally benign alternatives to heavy metal oxidants or elemental halogens.</AbstractNarration>
