    <AbstractNarration>DMS Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award #: 0134955&lt;br/&gt;PI: Lvov, Yuri &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute&lt;br/&gt;Program: Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Catherine Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: CAREER: Development and Applications of Weak Turbulence Theory&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Weak turbulence theory provides a broad framework for the study of&lt;br/&gt;steady-state statistical properties exibited by large classes of&lt;br/&gt;weakly nonlinear or weakly coupled physical systems. Within this&lt;br/&gt;framework, the research component of this work will focus on three&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problems in physics: the Garrett-Munk spetrum of internal&lt;br/&gt;waves in the ocean, finite-flux spectra in semiconductors with&lt;br/&gt;applications to semiconductor lasers, and Bose Einstein condensates.&lt;br/&gt;In each case, novel weak-turbulence-inspired techniques will be&lt;br/&gt;developed to compute the stationary energy spectra of the phenomena&lt;br/&gt;under investigation, which will provide an analytic statistical&lt;br/&gt;description of their long-term dynamics. Applications of this work&lt;br/&gt;include environmental aspects of ocean dynamics, semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing and increases in laser efficiency, and condensed-matter&lt;br/&gt;physics and materials science at low temperatures. The educational&lt;br/&gt;component includes course development on undergraduate and graduate&lt;br/&gt;level that will incorporate an experimental component in an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate mathematical modelling course, and a graduate course on&lt;br/&gt;waves and weak turbulence theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What do internal waves deep below the ocean surface, semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;lasers, and extremely cold metallic vapors have in common? They are&lt;br/&gt;all very complicated physical systems composed of simple components&lt;br/&gt;that interact weakly. Weak turbulence theory addresses these type of&lt;br/&gt;systems, and precdicts how the energy they contain will behave on&lt;br/&gt;average over long times. The question of how the energy of an&lt;br/&gt;internal ocean wave depends on this wave's length has an elegant&lt;br/&gt;experimental answer pointing to a universal law, but has eluded&lt;br/&gt;theoretical explanation for more than thirty years. This work aims to&lt;br/&gt;provide such an explanation, which will furnish new insights into the&lt;br/&gt;oceanic environment. Semiconductors and semiconductor lasers&lt;br/&gt;manufacturing and operation requires ever increasing efficiency. This&lt;br/&gt;work will explore an improvement that is based on a more efficient way&lt;br/&gt;of delivering energy to the working semiconductors and semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;lasers. Three quarters of a century ago Bose and Einstein predicted a&lt;br/&gt;new phase of materials, the Bose-Einstein condensate, that can only&lt;br/&gt;occur at extremely low temperatures. Finally, six years ago, this&lt;br/&gt;phase was realized experimentally, and the the creators of the&lt;br/&gt;experiment received this year's Nobel Prize. This work will provide a&lt;br/&gt;theoretical explanation of how extremely cold metal vapors settle into&lt;br/&gt;the Bose-Einstein condensate phase.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: December 17, 2001</AbstractNarration>
