    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on adapting and implementing the Working With Chemistry (WWC) laboratory program for General Chemistry students. WWC is an NSF DUE-funded inquiry-based laboratory program, developed by Wink, Gislason, and Kuehn at the University of Illinois-Chicago, designed for non-chemistry science majors. Experiments are grouped in threes: "Skill-building" (detailed procedure given; new skill learned), "Foundation" (students design part of a procedure, using new skill), and "Application" (students design a&lt;br/&gt;procedure using a new skill to solve real-world problems). Adoption of the WWC program changes instructional styles from traditional to problem-based. Adaptation of the WWC program is needed to better meet the needs and backgrounds of Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP) students, improve the instructional abilities of IUP faculty, and integrate technology into the laboratories. Trial runs of WWC indicated several changes were needed to successfully implement the program at IUP. The objectives and expected outcomes include: improve the pre-laboratory assignments to better prepare students for each experiment; implement a laboratory report tutorial; adapt the few WWC laboratories that have proved problematic at IUP; incorporate diode-array spectrophotometers and Vernier interfaces; develop and implement new experiment groups relevant to other majors in General Chemistry; adapt the existing instructor's guide; and implement a WebCT site. To achieve these outcomes, eight faculty, with appropriate expertise, are working individually and collectively to develop/adapt prelabs and experiment groups, install software and write student guidelines. Faculty reports for each laboratory are being used to enhance the instructor's guide. Continuing evaluation of the program is underway, and dissemination of results is planned.</AbstractNarration>
