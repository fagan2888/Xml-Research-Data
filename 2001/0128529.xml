    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project will develop technologies to synthesize nano tin/metal oxide anode materials for lithium rechargeable batteries. Reducing tin particles to nano size is known to be critical for a good cycle life of tin-based anode materials. The materials are expected to show a capacity of &gt;1000 mAh/cm3 which represents a &gt;50% increase over the practical capacity of carbonaceous materials presently used in lithium rechargeable batteries. In addition, the materials are expected to have a first cycle reversibility of &gt;80%, comparable to that of carbon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the materials market for the next generation of lithium rechargeable batteries. The market for portable batteries is about $6 billion, with an annual growth rate of 15% in the last 10 years. Of this, the worldwide portable lithium-ion battery market is $2.93 billion,&lt;br/&gt;with 530 million cells shipped in 2000. New markets are also emerging for electric and hybrid vehicle propulsion.</AbstractNarration>
