    <AbstractNarration>This award to the University of California at Berkeley supports the work of Professor Jeffrey R. Long, Department of Chemistry, aimed at the synthesis and characterization of expanded clusters using multinuclear cyanometalates as building blocks to make open frame and microporous materials. These clusters prepared by solution chemistry, after dehydration will result in porous materials with large void volumes and without loss of structural integrity. Cluster-cores with edge-bridged octahedral geometry will be prepared from cobalt, zirconium and other metal chlorides with boron or beryllium for potential applications in ion exchange reactions, porous magnets and chemical sensors. In addition, inclusion properties of pores will be modified for specific applications. Students involved in this project will learn advanced synthetic methods and will gain interdisciplinary experience in chemistry, materials, and physics relevant to nanoscience and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Porous clusters with large void spaces, open-framework and microporous solids will be robust and reusable. These clusters may be functionalized with inclusion groups for different applications such as ion exchange reactions, porous magnets for separations, and sensors for volatile organic compounds. In addition, students involved in the project will gain experience in solid state and inorganic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
