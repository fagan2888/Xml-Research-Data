    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Drs. James Murray and James Staley at the University of Washington to study microorganisms that mediate nitrogen transformations in low oxygen, or suboxic, environments. Such reactions are important because nitrogen is a critical element for life processes. The geochemical distributions in the Black Sea suggest that this is an ideal location to study these novel reactions. The research goals of this project are to discover, isolate and characterize the bacteria that are responsible for these nitrogen transformations. Closely coordinated microbial and geochemical approaches will be used. Samples will be collected on a research cruise to the Black Sea in 2002 from depths where the chemical transformations are inferred to occur. These samples will be used to enrich and isolate bacterial metabolic groups that can carry out these transformations. Laboratory studies will be used on a second research cruise in 2003 to develop molecular markers for identification of organisms in fresh environmental samples. In addition, probes will be developed to identify genes of enzymes that are involved in various redox reactions. Geochemical studies will be conducted to determine the stoichiometries, rates and nitrogen isotope fractionation in water samples from the reaction layers.&lt;br/&gt; Results of this investigation are expected to lead to discovery of novel, previously uncharacterized bacteria that carry out these important processes. The microorganism to be studied may be present in many ecosystems (such as sediments, anoxic aquatic environments, biofilms and microbial mats) where waters have low oxygen concentrations. This knowledge will increase our understanding of microbial diversity and anaerobic respiration in such marine environments. Human society is impacting aquatic environments more than ever, leading to an increase in suboxic aquatic habitats, and resulting in threats to fisheries and wildlife. Understanding the biological processes occurring in suboxic environments will lead to new approaches that could be undertaken for habitat restoration.</AbstractNarration>
