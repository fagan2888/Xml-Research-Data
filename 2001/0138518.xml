    <AbstractNarration>ECS-0138518&lt;br/&gt;Arpad Bergh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Optoelectronics Industry Development Association is establishing under NSF and DARPA support the Photonics Technology Access Program (PTAP), where government funds are used to procure pre-commercial photonics experimental research prototypes (hereinafter referred to as "prototypes") to be made available to qualified researchers in a competitive solicitation and evaluation process. These pre-commerical prototypes may comprise novel materials, material structures, devices and device arrays, circuits and modules. Academic researchers can use the prototypes to advance discovery and understanding in photonics and provide feedback to the industry. Professors may also use the prototypes to enhance teaching, training and learning in class demonstrations and teaching laboratories. The goal of the program is to improve the availability of novel experimental research prototypes to universities. New prototypes are evolving at increasing rate and frequency, and if researchers have access to them only when they are available commercially, they are one or two generations behind leading edge technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is modeled after the successful parts of the U.S.-Japan Joint Optoelectronics Project (JOP). Although the proposed program is domestic in nature, it has the potential to be expanded internationally at a later date to include Japan, Europe and others. Such an expansion might be considered to enrich the offerings of the program to include prototypes that are not available in the U.S. and to collect feedback from academic researchers from outside the U.S. who might have different perspectives. OIDA is well qualified to provide the broker function for this program based on its five years of experience with the JOP, including managing the domestic competitive solicitation and evaluation process supported with NSF and DARPA funds. OIDA also has strong interactions with large and small photonics companies and photonics-active academic institutions. To further strengthen its ties with PTAP constituencies, OIDA would assemble an Advisory Board for this program comprising leading researchers and educators from academia, industry and government.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Photonics is a key enabling technology for the information age and it complements the goals of the National Nanotechnology Initiative and the National Information Technology Initiative. The proposed Photonics Technology Access Program also contributes to workforce development in science, engineering and technology and benefits numerous existing photonics programs thoughout the government. The program also helps industry, especially small companies who might find new applications for their leading prototypes.</AbstractNarration>
