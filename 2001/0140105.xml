    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for a group at Michigan State University for a program of research and education in experimental elementary particle physics based on the CDF experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider and on the ATLAS experiment at the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, Geneva. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MSU group has been a member of the CDF experiment since 1992. The group has major responsibilities to the Run II upgrades for the new plug calorimeters, to the new central tracker, to the muon system upgrade and to a new central pre-radiator detector. They are actively engaged in the analyses of QCD physics. The group's work on ATLAS &lt;br/&gt;involves the construction and testing of the hadron calorimeter subsystem, involving scintillator tiles and optical fibers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Members of the MSU group are involving undergraduates and high school teachers and students in their research activities. The group is a member of QuarkNet, the multi-institutional effort to involve high school teachers and their students in particle physics research.</AbstractNarration>
