    <AbstractNarration>This project proposes workshop, to be conducted in June 2002 on "Managing as Designing" to undertake a high-risk effort to create a new approach to management education. Design thinking as a powerful way of approaching problems is the underlying philosophy, in contrast to the prevailing emphasis on purely analytical skills in decision-making characterizing management education since the 1960's. Design represents a distinct mode of cognition different from analytical decision making, and suggests a more creative approach especially to the problem of envisioning new futures. The objective of the workshop is to define a new vocabulary of management education based on design thinking. The workshop will engage a broad range of scholars, designers and managers representing disciplines including architecture, music, art, sociology, history, communication and management</AbstractNarration>
