    <AbstractNarration>In recent years, researchers have developed and studied a variety of instructional materials that can support students learning how to conduct investigations in project-based science classrooms, but few classroom assessment materials and tools have been developed to support these materials. Ideally, such assessments would give teachers a better understanding of what students know at any point in a project in order to adjust and improve instruction. This project will develop, test, and evaluate classroom assessments for extended science projects that are supported by handheld computers. To develop the assessments, the investigators will create on teams of teachers, assessment specialists, software developers, and researchers to develop these tools. The project will rely on a small group of teachers in the Beaufort County Public Schools to try out the assessments. SRI researchers will evaluate factors associated with adoption of the handheld tools in a variety of classrooms and measure its effectiveness in improving teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>
