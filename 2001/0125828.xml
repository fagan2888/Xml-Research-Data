    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;The project is completely redesigning the optics course for non-science majors, A World of Light and Color, from a traditional lecture format into a collaborative, activity-based classroom environment. About 80% of the students attending Western Maryland College (WMC) are non- science majors and many lack a basic comprehension of the scientific endeavor. During the past decade, the physics education research community has demonstrated that well-designed, student- centered activities help students achieve a deeper understanding of physical concepts, while fostering an appreciation of science. To capitalize on these findings, the project is combining the Workshop Physics approach with optics activities that have been developed at WMC. Workshop Physics, a discovery-based approach pioneered at Dickinson College, has been successful in introductory physics courses, and the project is adapting and implementing many aspects of this delivery method to meet the needs of General Science students. Providing students the opportunity to explore optical phenomena in a collaborative, student- centered environment should result in a positive learning experience. Students also should appreciate the role computers and data analysis play in the scientific process, and computer-assisted activities appropriate are being designed specifically for non-science majors. A specific objective of the project is to develop and disseminate high-quality optics activities for non-science majors nationwide. Finally, this project will serve as a prototype for the renovation of the entire General Science curriculum at WMC.</AbstractNarration>
