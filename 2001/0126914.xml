    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;The joint project of the mathematics and biology departments is focused on the entire biology curriculum, including biology education. It is adapted from materials developed in the well-tested programs of the University of California at Davis, the University of Tennessee, and the University of Utah. The ideas implemented at Beloit College and Macalaster College provide additional guidance. Aspects of each of these programs are integrated with ideas developed at Appalachia State to take full advantage of existing local resources and support systems. The aims are to: a. increase students' computational maturity through realistic biological applications in mathematics and statistics coursework; b. reinforce students' computational skills through mathematical, statistical and technological integration in biology coursework; c. foster communication and collaboration between the departments for research, student projects, and course development; and d. increase the marketability of students by giving them a broader set of skills from which to draw. The courses affected include the introductory mathematics sequence (use of biology related examples and guest lectures from biology faculty to highlight biologically important mathematics concepts), introductory biology courses (introduction of mathematics modules many of which parallel research being done at Appalachia) and introduction of advanced cross-disciplinary courses developed and co-taught by faculty from both departments. Evaluation of the project includes oversight by a team of mathematicians and biologists who are actively involved in similar curricular reform and of a science educator and mathematics educator.</AbstractNarration>
