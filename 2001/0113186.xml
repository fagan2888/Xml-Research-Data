    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Conference on Condensed Matter Physics is aimed at bringing together world leaders, young investigators and students at all levels to present and discuss exciting new results and the inter-relations between the diverse subfields in condensed matter physics. The topics covered range from quantum electronics and transport to soft condensed matter and biophysics. In this years conference the different areas are tied together by an interest in organic molecules their properties and assembly. Dramatic new results on insulting organic crystals doped metallic and superconducting by applying a gate electrode lead to new insights into transport in carbon based systems. The results on organic crystals are to be compared/contrasted with those of nanotubes, polymers and DNA. Transport in DNA is then considered in solution and leads to an understanding of its dielectric properties and the way it can be manipulated and self assembled into various structures. The information content and its value in biological systems is presented. Problems of frustrated packings and jamming are then discussed also in relation to the glasses and granular materials. The conference provides lectures, but emphasizes a large amount of time for formal and informal discussions between lecturers and students. The students are encouraged to participate directly by presenting posters on their work to serve as a focal point for interaction with more senior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gordon Conference on Condensed Matter Physics is aimed at bringing together world leaders, young investigators and students at all levels to present and discuss exciting new results in forefront areas of the physics of new electronic, structural, organic and biological materials. The participants will be from academe, industry and government labs. Organic crystals, polymers, and biological materials have very recently been shown to be electrical conductors with controllable properties useful for data storage, light emission, computation, mobility and interesting new structures. These materials bring new insight into both fundamental science and potential and present applications. They also illustrate the relative advantages of organic and inorganic systems. Student participation is encouraged both by the large amount of time devoted to formal and informal discussion as well as poster sessions where the students present their results as a focal points for interaction with more senior researchers.</AbstractNarration>
