    <AbstractNarration>0104911 W. Allen Miller&lt;br/&gt;Significant regulation of gene expression occurs at many levels after transcription of genetic information into messenger RNA. This meeting will focus on mechanisms of RNA regulation, from transcription in the nucleus until the encoded genetic information has been converted to protein via translation. Until recently, post-transcriptional events, such as mRNA processing, mRNA decay, and translation have not been studied extensively in plants. However, exciting new discoveries have revealed a plethora of post-transcriptional control events ranging from the subtle (e.g., mRNA stability) to the sublime (e.g., post-transcriptional gene silencing). The plenary speakers will cover diverse biological functions such as host-pathogen interactions, abiotic stress response, chloroplast function, and plant development. The following specific topics will be covered: RNA-mediated, post-transcriptional gene silencing; suppression of gene silencing; mRNA turnover; pre-mRNA splicing; novel viral mRNA translation mechanisms; translational control of plant genes; and bioinformatics and genomics. Attendees of this meeting will come away with an increased awareness of the amazing diversity of gene expression mechanisms. Furthermore, this meeting will highlight the need for further research into understanding post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression as more eukaryotic genomes are nearing completion and new genes are discovered.</AbstractNarration>
