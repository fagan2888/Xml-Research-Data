    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0103647&lt;br/&gt;Johathan M. Rosenberg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Jonathan Rosenberg will study the topology and &lt;br/&gt;geometry of manifolds and manifold-like spaces, as well as &lt;br/&gt;C*-algebraic index theory. By this we mean a combination &lt;br/&gt;of C*-algebra theory, index theory of elliptic operators,&lt;br/&gt;K-theory, geometry, and topology. One main focus of the &lt;br/&gt;proposal will be the use of invariants coming from C*-algebras (especially Kasparov's KK-theory) to study the geometry and &lt;br/&gt;topology of manifolds. For example, KK-classes coming from the classical elliptic operators (the Euler characteristic&lt;br/&gt;operator, the signature operator, and the Dolbeault operator)&lt;br/&gt;will be intensively studied. Attention will also be paid to the equivariant case, where a finite group acts on the manifold in question. These studies will deepen the link between &lt;br/&gt;topological and analytic approaches to manifold theory. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, Professor Rosenberg will study the classification &lt;br/&gt;of manifolds via their Yamabe invariants, and the &lt;br/&gt;classification of metrics of positive scalar curvature, &lt;br/&gt;problems which involve a quite subtle blend&lt;br/&gt;of differential topology, differential geometry,&lt;br/&gt;and analysis. He will also study the applications&lt;br/&gt;of K-theory to the study of C*-algebras, and various &lt;br/&gt;related problems on algebraic K-theory, especially on &lt;br/&gt;algebras of operators or on algebras coming from &lt;br/&gt;quantization of geometrical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The context of this project is the use of new methods &lt;br/&gt;in analysis, based on noncommutative operator algebras, &lt;br/&gt;for attacking problems in geometry and topology. On the &lt;br/&gt;one hand, these methods are useful as a new source&lt;br/&gt;of tools for studying geometry, especially in high dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;And on the other hand, the methods are motivated (and more &lt;br/&gt;or less forced) by the quantization of classical physical &lt;br/&gt;systems. The study of the scalar curvature properties of &lt;br/&gt;manifolds is also motivated by problems in gravitation. &lt;br/&gt;Professor Rosenberg will continue to train graduate&lt;br/&gt;students in analysis, geometry, and topology, and will &lt;br/&gt;also work toward integration of mathematical software &lt;br/&gt;into the undergraduate mathematics curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
