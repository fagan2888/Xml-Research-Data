    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary.&lt;br/&gt;The Centennial Scholars Project is allowing students with high academic potential and financial need to benefit from a laboratory-intensive curriculum providing hands-on education, partnerships with industry, and access to senior faculty in small classes. Twenty-nine scholarships of $3,125 each are being awarded annually to students majoring in mathematics, industrial and manufacturing engineering, mechanical engineering, or computer science. The majority of the scholarships are two-year awards for freshmen; these scholarships are automatically renewed providing the students maintain eligibility. A special emphasis is placed on assisting the scholars in overcoming points of unusually high attrition (normally the first five quarters of enrollment for freshmen and the first year for transfer students) more successfully than a demographically comparable group. The support services available include mentoring by alumni with industry experience, supplemental instruction in mathematics and physics, prioritized access to academic enrichment resources, and opportunities for hands-on research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NO.:&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION NAME:&lt;br/&gt;TITLE:&lt;br/&gt;NSF RECEIVED DATE:&lt;br/&gt;0123141&lt;br/&gt;Patton, Linda&lt;br/&gt;California Polytechnic State University Foundation&lt;br/&gt;Centennial Scholars: Access to "Learn by Doing" Polytechnic Education NSF Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships Program&lt;br/&gt;05/01/2001</AbstractNarration>
