    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0137171&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers at the Texas A &amp; M University will perform analysis, quality control, and adjustment of the transmissometer data from the Hawaii Oceanographic Time-Series (HOT) and from the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) data sets collected during the last decade. These data were collected at fixed locations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and provide important data on seasonal and interannual variations, covering all seasons at both sites. The unprocessed or pre-processed data reside in the appropriate laboratories, but several different characteristic errors are in the data, making them unreliable for modeling and analysis in their present condition. The researchers will analyze the data, control their quality and make necessary adjustments. The adjusted data will be used for assessment of the regional and seasonal Beam Attenuation - Particulate Organic Carbon relationships. After checking and adjustment, the data will be posted on HOT, BATS and TAMU web-servers. The data will be analyzed for seasonal and interannual variability and will be made available to the scientific community for the purpose of modeling ocean carbon cycles or evaluating the output from existing models.</AbstractNarration>
