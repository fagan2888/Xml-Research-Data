    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses the input of nutrients (specifically, iron) to the oceans from atmospheric transport of dust, and the production of sulfur containing gaseous species (such as DMS, dimethyl sulfide) by the ocean organisms as a result. Increased production of DMS leads to increased atmospheric particle formation which in turn can affect climate. The principal investigator will participate in a research cruise where she will sample atmospheric particulates and analyze them for their trace metal content (including Fe(II)), and measure the gas-phase concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), the atmospheric particulate concentrations of sulfate, and methane sulfonic acid (MSA), all oxidation product of DMS. She will also carry out photochemical leaching experiments which will simulate the interaction between atmospheric aerosols and ocean water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, supported under the ADVANCE program, will launch the independent career of a female scientist. It will expose undergraduate students to research at the interface of atmospheric chemistry and oceanography, and will improve our understanding of the role of atmospheric aerosols in enhancing ocean productivity.</AbstractNarration>
