    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Thomas W. Budd at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York to acquire two major instruments that will complement and expand opportunities for microscopic studies and enable the creation of an Interdisciplinary, Multi-User Microscopy-Imagery Center within the science facilities complex. The instruments to be acquired are: 1. A confocal microscope system that will bridge the resolution gap between electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. This instrument will allow optical sectioning and 3-D reconstructions of fluorescent images with much better resolution and a wider selection of dyes than conventional fluorescence microscopes. 2. An Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDAX) system to be fitted onto an existing scanning electron microscope (SEM). This system allows elemental analysis and spatial elemental mapping of a wide variety of research specimens applicable to biology, chemistry, environmental studies, and geology research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several St. Lawrence science faculty are poised to direct student projects with these instruments as part of their research programs. Dr. T. Budd (biology and PI) plans to use confocal microscopy to three-dimensionally map proteins on the surface and inside of glial-neural type cells in vitro as part of his research to characterize tissue cultured cells used to study bone formation. He will confirm the 3-D confocal results by using SEM-EDAX mapping routines. Dr. Marano (chemistry) will use confocal microscopy to detect and map the components of specialized membrane "domains" on the surface of T-lymphocytes. These domains have been implicated in gene regulation during immune responses. Dr. Erlichman (biology) will use confocal microscopy to three-dimensionally map sodium/hydrogen exchange transport systems in the surface membranes of pH sensitive neurons that regulate breathing in mammals. Dr. Erickson (geology) will use SEM-EDAX elemental analysis and mapping to study the sequence and biogeochemistry of fossilization of clams. Several other St. Lawrence faculty are also poised to use the new instruments in their research programs, all of which involve active participation by students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will greatly enhance faculty and student research activity in the science departments at St. Lawrence, as well as provide instrumentation support for two new majors in biochemistry and neuroscience. As a small, private liberal arts undergraduate institution, access to state-of-the-art instrumentation is often limited. The instruments requested will enable us to better train the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
