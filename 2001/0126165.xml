    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project is an interdisciplinary effort between the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and the Biology Department. New Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) Instrumentation is being integrated into the laboratory component of several analysis oriented chemistry, biology and biochemistry courses using modern teaching methodologies. The focus of the plan is to develop an analytical/biochemistry cluster of experiments that runs through the current Sophomore and Junior/Senior laboratory courses. Experiments within this cluster are based upon the Case Study method, with students working in small groups; involve the use of one or both of the proposed instruments; and focus on issues of biochemical relevance. Experiments and protocols from the Journal of Chemical Education and from primary research journals are being combined and adapted in order to create the Case Studies. This approach better prepares chemistry, biology, and biochemistry students by involving them in the consideration of "real world" problems, and by providing hands-on experience using modern analytical instrumentation and techniques. As a result of this experience, students are expected to become more efficient learners, retain what they learn longer, exercise their critical thinking skills, and involve themselves in more interesting and challenging experiments than were available in the past. Case Studies are being written in a manner that will allow other colleges and universities, similarly equipped, to readily adapt these methods. Results of the project will be reported at national and regional meetings and published in appropriate college science teaching journals.</AbstractNarration>
