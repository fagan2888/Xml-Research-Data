    <AbstractNarration>The UNLV Physics Department will host a 10-week undergraduate research participation project, Undergraduate Research in Physics, during the summers of 2002-2004, with followup during each academic year. Research in the department is in the areas of atomic, molecular, chemical and optical physics, condensed matter physics, high pressure physics, and materials science. Students will obtain hands-on laboratory experience in our well-equipped laser laboratories, and use major condensed-matter research facilities: the Scanning Electron Microscope, an Electron Probe Micro Analyzer, an X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer, and an X- Ray Diffractometer. A series of group activities includes seminars on an introduction to research, research ethics, giving a scientific presentation, and getting into graduate school, as well as social functions. Students will be recruited from UNLV undergraduates and from other colleges and universities, with special attention paid to selected schools in the West and Mid-West. Applicants from institutions where research opportunities are limited will be given higher priority over those from major research universities. The program ends by students creating a poster presenting their research results, which they display at a special poster session that attracts a large university-wide audience.</AbstractNarration>
