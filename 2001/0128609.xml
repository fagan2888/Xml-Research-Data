    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will determine the feasibility of designing the scanning electron microscope (SEM) component of an instrument simulator. Cost prohibits that incorporation of a variety of image/composition-based instruments used in research and industry into relevant modern science/math/ engineering/technology curricula. Some of these instruments are becoming available over the Internet, but they provide limited access to students and, in general, they are not fully functional. The research objectives in Phase I to will primarily relate to the method(s) of manipulating a very large image (the equivalent of over 1000 SEM images) in a manner that faithfully simulates the operation of a real WEB-based SEM. The key research area will be to develop an image-management and input/output engine. The anticipated deliverable of Phase I is the SEM image simulator, and the outline of several educational modules on CD/DVD media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Instrument simulation proffered by the RJ Lee Group has the potential to distribute the benefits of the resource of a variety of image/composition-based instruments (via CD or DVD) to all students in a class throughout a school year. A simplified viewer mode would be developed for the informal education and home markets, and an advanced mode incorporating specific science content interactive discovery-based modules would be developed for the K-college formal education market.</AbstractNarration>
