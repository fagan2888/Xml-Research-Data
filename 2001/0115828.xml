    <AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose research in understanding the nonlinear dynamics of MEMS gyroscopes to achieve better gyro performance. The onset of instability in MEMS gyroscopes that is reported in the literature prevents the microgyros from operating at optimum conditions. Specifically, the mismatch between the resonance frequencies in the microgyro structure was not minimized in existing designs. Since the microgyros have very low damping, operating not at perfect resonance greatly limits the gyro performances. To remove this barrier, nonlinearity in the system must be considered since the system dynamics near resonances is well-known to be greatly affected by nonlinear effects even though these nonlinear effects are otherwise small. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We also propose development effort to find better fabrication techniques to make thick structures for the microgyros. This is purely motivated by the simple fact that microgyros are inertia sensors and thicker structures will accentuate the Coriolis force and make the signal detection more immune to the noise associated with the signal amplification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the tremendous amount of research and development effort on MEMS inertia sensors, the crucial research results are not available in the literature. Much of the know-how about microgyro designs remains proprietary. Through the proposed research, we hope to provide the research community our findings about the design considerations and innovative fabrication techniques for the microgyros. Moreover, by involving both graduate and undergraduate students in this research and incorporating MEMS in the engineering curriculum, we hope to better prepare students for the work force. Moreover, by taking advantage of the existing program called "Diversity in Engineering" at University of Missouri, we hope to interest more under-represented minority students in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
