    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Perrine at Anderson University to enable undergraduate students to experience research opportunities in the fields of genetics and cell biology. The goals of the study are to educate students in modern research principles and prepare them for careers in biotechnology, as well as to further understanding of paramyxovirus-mediated cell fusion. Paramyxoviruses, such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus, cause upper respiratory infections. These viruses gain access to cells in the respiratory tract by fusing with the cell membrane. The viral proteins responsible for this fusion show similarities to the fusion proteins of influenza virus and HIV. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The genetic experiments will focus on the relationship between the sequence of the primary fusion protein, F, and function. The gene sequence of the cloned F gene will be altered by substitutions, deletions, and additions. The altered protein will be expressed in an artificial system that allows easy visualization of the extent of fusion. In this manner, the relationship between specific changes and the ability to fuse cells in the reporter system will be detailed. The cell biology experiments will focus on the characteristics and requirements for fusion, including the time course of expression, the requirements of pH and temperature, and the role of protein modifications. In addition, different types of cells and different paramyxoviruses will be tested for their ability to undergo fusion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enrich student's undergraduate education and prepare them for careers in the research fields of genetics and cell biology. They will experience research opportunities on a similar, but smaller scale, to what is being done in major research institutions around the country, including Eli Lilly and Roche Pharmaceuticals that are located in the geographical vicinity of Anderson University in Indiana.&lt;br/&gt; Many of these students will continue post-graduate education in areas of medicine and biotechnology. This project will also contribute to the understanding of viral infections. Several viruses, including the paramyxoviruses, influenza, and HIV, use fusion to gain access to the cells of our bodies. An understanding of the requirements for viral fusion enables researchers to prevent infection by preventing fusion. These studies will find practical application in the development of vaccines and anti-viral therapies.</AbstractNarration>
