    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research project has as its primary objective the investigation of the feasibility of a novel 360-degree display monitor concept for video conferencing. Videoconferencing technology has long sought to facilitate more natural and effective one-on-one and group communications and collaboration among people separated by distance. The plan is to build a 360-degree monitor to show panoramic video images from the center of the table to all 360-degree viewing angles. All participants can see the displayed image from where he/she is seated. At the same time, all participants in the conference room can see each other directly, while communicating with people from the other site via the 360-degree display monitor and a 360-degree camera. &lt;br/&gt; Genex Technologies' proffered technology will be of interest for a broad range to a broad range of consumers. Its applications include videoconferencing, security, and the entertainment industry.</AbstractNarration>
