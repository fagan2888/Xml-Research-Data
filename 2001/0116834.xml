    <AbstractNarration>This three-day conference will provide a forum for in-depth dialogue on innovative research in the area of Neural Control of Behavior. The first two days will be devoted to a symposium that will be open to the scientific community. There will be four sessions: Neurosecretion Over Different Time Domains; Genetic Dissection of Behavior; Local Protein Synthesis During Neuronal Plasticity and Regeneration; and Learning and Memory: New Directions. The speakers will discuss a wide spectrum of species (use of invertebrates to mammals) and experimental approaches (from molecular and cellular to behavioral levels of analyses). The third day of the meeting will be devoted to a workshop among only the speakers, where they will explore ways in which information discussed during the symposium can be used to take their respective research areas in new directions. This conference aims to: Bring together researchers who are asking similar questions, but are using different species and different experimental approaches; Promote the use of simple systems for addressing complex biological problems; Promote interaction between junior scientists - women in particular - and established investigators and leaders in the field. The speakers use modern, cutting-edge technologies for addressing problems in the area of Neural Control of Behavior. By bringing together these researchers, and giving them a forum for discussing their work, the message can be effectively spread that these modern techniques are being used with great success in a wide variety of animal systems. This conference will provide an important interdisciplinary communications-mechanism for advancements in the neuroscience community.</AbstractNarration>
