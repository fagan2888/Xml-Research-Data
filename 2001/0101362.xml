    <AbstractNarration>The Community College of Philadelphia is engaged in a partnership with 12 baccalaureate-degree granting institutions in Pennsylvania to: (1) create a new degree option for students preparing for careers in secondary math or science education; and (2) expand the articulation agreements with four-year institutions to include secondary education. Two new courses and educational materials focused on inquiry-based, hands-on learning, are being developed for prospective teachers: Teaching with Technology and Problem-Solving in Math and Science. Both courses explore the use of technology to investigate authentic problems in math and science. Students develop a portfolio of problem-based learning scenarios using technology appropriate for use in their future professional practice. The project addresses the International Society for Technology in Education standards for preservice preparation in technology. The project also includes customized systems of advising and mentoring; recruitment of prospective teachers from mathematics and science courses; learning communities; an education student club; and faculty development workshops.</AbstractNarration>
