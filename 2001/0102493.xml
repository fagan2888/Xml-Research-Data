    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences: Shock Waves and Geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0102493&lt;br/&gt;Temple&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is focused on the interplay between &lt;br/&gt;principles of geometry and the principles of the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical theory of shock waves. There are three main &lt;br/&gt;areas of research. The first is analysis of regularity &lt;br/&gt;and shock formation in initial value problems for weak &lt;br/&gt;solutions of the Einstein equations. The second area is &lt;br/&gt;development of shock-matching methods with application to &lt;br/&gt;blast waves in general relativity. The third area is &lt;br/&gt;investigation of oscillations in systems of conservation &lt;br/&gt;laws, with particular emphasis on analyzing oscillations &lt;br/&gt;that are generated in transonic flow. As part of the &lt;br/&gt;project, we combine Glimm's theory of wave interactions &lt;br/&gt;with the theory of general relativity to analyze shock &lt;br/&gt;wave interactions for Einstein's equations. Since the &lt;br/&gt;Einstein equations contain the compressible Euler &lt;br/&gt;equations as a subsystem, results on shock wave &lt;br/&gt;propagation in general relativity are expected to have &lt;br/&gt;new implications for analysis of shock waves in classical &lt;br/&gt;fluids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We are developing a theory of shock wave propagation in &lt;br/&gt;Einstein's theory of general relativity. A shock wave is &lt;br/&gt;best known as the blast wave that marks the leading edge &lt;br/&gt;of an explosion. In that case, the shock wave is the &lt;br/&gt;surface between the rapidly expanding material and the &lt;br/&gt;ambient, undisturbed air into which the shock front &lt;br/&gt;propagates. In general relativity, shock waves are waves &lt;br/&gt;in the curvature of spacetime itself. There are thus new &lt;br/&gt;and interesting fundamental issues involved in extending &lt;br/&gt;Einstein's equations to a setting that admits shock wave &lt;br/&gt;propagation. As part of the project, we are constructing &lt;br/&gt;new exact solutions of Einstein's equations that &lt;br/&gt;incorporate a blast wave into the Big Bang -- the &lt;br/&gt;explosion that first set the universe into expansion. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical results will also have application to &lt;br/&gt;shock waves in ordinary fluids.</AbstractNarration>
