    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative project involving Drury University, Central Missouri State University, and Lamar University Beaumont. Despite efforts of the Calculus Reform movement, in some institutions, the success rate of students in calculus remains low. Problem-based learning has proven to be an effective pedagogical technique which addresses a diversity of learning styles, but there are no published materials for teaching the calculus sequence using it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is completing the writing of texts for teaching Calculus I, II, and III using a problem-based learning approach, the modified Moore method, and incorporating an appropriate usage of technology. McGraw-Hill has published Calculus I, A Discovery Workbook, written by two of the investigators, and expresses interest in publishing Calculus II and III as well. Activities include assessment of the effectiveness of this method and dissemination of the results in faculty development workshops. The investigators and the advisory board members are innovativors in the use of problem-based teaching and learning and are active in discussing this method in the broader mathematical community and in disseminating materials for use in problem-based courses.</AbstractNarration>
