    <AbstractNarration>0104350&lt;br/&gt;Siegel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is concerned with the analysis and numerical computation of &lt;br/&gt;moving boundaries in problems from fluid dynamics and materials &lt;br/&gt;science. The proposed problems are motivated by different applications &lt;br/&gt;but are remarkably similar from a mathematical point of view. One class &lt;br/&gt;of problems concerns the deformation and breakup via tip streaming of &lt;br/&gt;drops and bubbles in extensional flows. Tip streaming refers to the &lt;br/&gt;phenomenon where a bubble develops a deformed shape featuring &lt;br/&gt;cusplike ends, from which fine filaments or small bubbles are emitted into &lt;br/&gt;the exterior fluid. Experiments suggest that interfacial tension gradients &lt;br/&gt;such as those produced by surfactants are important for the onset of this &lt;br/&gt;instability. The PI shall continue his development of an analytical theory &lt;br/&gt;for the deformation and evolution of slender bubbles with surfactant, &lt;br/&gt;focusing on the effects of soluble surfactant and its influence in tip &lt;br/&gt;streaming. Mathematical difficulties in the analysis are associated with a &lt;br/&gt;jump in boundary conditions at "stagnant caps" of surfactant on the free &lt;br/&gt;surface. Techniques employed to address these difficulties include &lt;br/&gt;singular perturbation theory, theory of singular integral equations and &lt;br/&gt;Riemann-Hilbert problems, and complex variable theory in moving &lt;br/&gt;boundary problems. The theory will be complemented by accurate &lt;br/&gt;numerical computations. The PI also proposes to investigate tip streaming &lt;br/&gt;and air entrainment in simple models of fiber coating, as well as cusp &lt;br/&gt;formation and a possible analogue of tip streaming which may occur &lt;br/&gt;during the diffusion controlled evolution of voids in a stressed solid. The &lt;br/&gt;mathematical statements of these free boundary problems are similar, and &lt;br/&gt;the PI expects that there will be a certain synergism between them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving boundary problems, such as the evolution of waves on water, the &lt;br/&gt;propagation of flame fronts, or the growth of crystals, continue to &lt;br/&gt;challenge applied scientists and engineers. The PI proposes to study a &lt;br/&gt;class of fundamental moving boundary problems that are important in &lt;br/&gt;technological applications. A common feature among the proposed &lt;br/&gt;problems is that the moving interface develops very small-scale features, &lt;br/&gt;such as cusps or very fine filaments, which can then greatly influence the &lt;br/&gt;properties of the material or fluid. One application of the proposed work is &lt;br/&gt;in the coating of materials (such as optical fibers) by pulling at high speed &lt;br/&gt;through a liquid bath. Air filaments produced during the coating process &lt;br/&gt;can snap off, leaving voids or other blemishes that adulterate the coating. &lt;br/&gt;A second application is in the failure of materials. Small pores present in &lt;br/&gt;materials evolve (via atomic diffusion) when the material is stressed. Cusp &lt;br/&gt;development in the pores can initiate cracks or dislocations (misalignment &lt;br/&gt;of atoms); this has been implicated as a prominent cause of failure in &lt;br/&gt;microelectronic circuits. Other applications include emulsion formation &lt;br/&gt;and mixing in multi-component fluid systems.</AbstractNarration>
