    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-00140194&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robert Strichartz&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted in analysis on fractals.&lt;br/&gt;Analysis on fractals studies the properties of functions&lt;br/&gt;defined on fractals, centering on certain analogs of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. Over the past few years, the P.I.&lt;br/&gt;has been actively involved in developing this area, in&lt;br/&gt;particular establishing connections with more traditional&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematical analysis, including harmonic analysis,&lt;br/&gt;analysis on manifolds, partial differential equations, and&lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis. On a limited class of self-similar&lt;br/&gt;fractals it is possible to construct operators that play the&lt;br/&gt;role of the Laplacian, one of the central objects in&lt;br/&gt;traditional analysis on Euclidean spaces and manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;The work of the P.I. has led to a deeper understanding of&lt;br/&gt;these Laplacians. At the same time he has studied certain&lt;br/&gt;related nonlinear problems on these fractals, and has&lt;br/&gt;worked on extending the scope of the theory to include a&lt;br/&gt;wider class of fractals. This project will build on and&lt;br/&gt;continue this work. A second area of research is the study&lt;br/&gt;of harmonic analysis of fractal measures and functions with&lt;br/&gt;fractal spectrum. Previous research has shown that for a&lt;br/&gt;special class of fractal measures there is a generalization&lt;br/&gt;of the theory of Fourier series. By duality this yields a&lt;br/&gt;sampling theorem for functions whose spectrum lies in&lt;br/&gt;certain special fractals. The proposed research will&lt;br/&gt;attempt to find out what happens outside this narrow class&lt;br/&gt;of examples.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis on fractals is an emerging area with tremendous&lt;br/&gt;potential in both pure and applied mathematics. Scientists&lt;br/&gt;in diverse areas have realized that many objects in the&lt;br/&gt;real world can be modeled by fractals, and mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;have been exploring the properties of fractal sets and&lt;br/&gt;measures. This project will enhance the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theory, both by making connections with more traditional&lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics, and by developing numerical tools&lt;br/&gt;that could be used by applied mathematicians and scientists&lt;br/&gt;in the future. This project includes collaborative work&lt;br/&gt;with undergraduate students (REU) on computer experiments&lt;br/&gt;to explore examples and generate conjectures. It is expected&lt;br/&gt;that this experimental work will lead to deeper theoretical&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the subject.</AbstractNarration>
