    <AbstractNarration>This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Georgia Tech. David Collard is the site's Program Director and Thomas Moran is the Co-Director. Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. The student participants choose from more than thirty projects in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and polymer chemistry. Each student will work closely with a faculty mentor. Activities will include regular group meetings, REU gatherings, and two REU Symposia. Field trips to local industrial organizations and government agencies are planned. Students are expected to be co-authors on submissions to scholarly journals. A series of exit interviews and follow-up surveys to both the participants and their undergraduate advisors at their home institution are planned as part of the assessment of the program.</AbstractNarration>
