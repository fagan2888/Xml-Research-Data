    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to carry out a detailed multi-disciplinary study of single-electron&lt;br/&gt;latching switches and of possible use of 2D arrays of such switches for hardware&lt;br/&gt;implementation of self-organizing (plastic) neuromorphic networks. Preliminary estimates&lt;br/&gt;show that such networks may provide unparalleled possibilities for complex information&lt;br/&gt;processing. By these estimates, the networks may also have remarkable scaling properties:&lt;br/&gt;if implemented using a 10-nm technology, they may have density about 10 8 neurons per&lt;br/&gt;cm 2 at manageable power dissipation below 100 W/cm 2 , and feature full learning cycle time&lt;br/&gt;of the order of a few seconds. This scaling gives every hope that the networks will be able,&lt;br/&gt;after initial (largely unsupervised) learning, not only provide complex information processing&lt;br/&gt;including complex image recognition, but possibly reproduce biological evolution of the&lt;br/&gt;cerebral cortex at a time scale some 6 orders of magnitude shorter.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed project is to carry out a preliminary study of this&lt;br/&gt;remarkable opportunity, addressing all its basic aspects at several structural levels. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, research will include the following components:&lt;br/&gt;A. Single-electron switch node design (D. Averin, K. Likharev, J. Wells).&lt;br/&gt;Detailed theoretical analysis and modeling (on two basic levels of single-electron transport&lt;br/&gt;theory) of statics, dynamics, and statistics of the proposed single-electron latching switches.&lt;br/&gt;B. Low temperature prototyping (J. Lukens). Fabrication and experimental&lt;br/&gt;study of Al/AlOx/Al prototypes of single-electron latching switches, with the goal to scale&lt;br/&gt;single-electron islands down to 100 nm and tunnel junctions to 10 nm, respectively, which&lt;br/&gt;would bring the reliable operation temperature up to about 10 K.&lt;br/&gt;C. Molecular single-electron device development (B. Brunschwig, J. Lukens,&lt;br/&gt;A. Mayr). Exploration of the opportunity to implement the basic component of the switches,&lt;br/&gt;the single-electron transistor, by chemical self-assembly of molecular components. The&lt;br/&gt;molecular components will be deposited in solution on the prefabricated metallic wire&lt;br/&gt;structures, and then characterized using a set of electrical, electrochemical, and time-resolved&lt;br/&gt;laser-spectrometry methods.&lt;br/&gt;D. Top level modeling and analysis (J. Barhen, M. Bender, K. Likharev).&lt;br/&gt;Large-scale computer simulation and a partial analytical study of the growth, dynamics, and&lt;br/&gt;self-adaptation of neuromorphic networks based on these switches.&lt;br/&gt;Hopefully, the project will achieve enough progress to justify a large-scale R&amp;D effort&lt;br/&gt;in this exciting direction. In particular, a reliable evidence of self-organization of adaptive&lt;br/&gt;neuromorphic networks during largely unsupervised learning would certainly be followed by&lt;br/&gt;the first hardware implementations of sizable networks (possibly, after an initial stage of&lt;br/&gt;purely-CMOS-based prototyping using commercially available FPGA technology).&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a substantial educational component. Specifically (besides&lt;br/&gt;participating in general educational Stony Brook initiatives), at least 4 FTE graduate&lt;br/&gt;students will be involved in the project each year, and some 20 undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;graduate students will take part in the project during its full 4-year period. At least one&lt;br/&gt;student will work in BNL and one in ORNL most of the time. Working in a multi-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;team will allow these students to overcome inter-departmental barriers in their education.&lt;br/&gt;As another specific educational initiative, we plan to organize a Web-based undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;course on massively parallel supercomputing and neural networks, using the IBM SP3&lt;br/&gt;computer at Oak Ridge.&lt;br/&gt;Work on the inter-related aspects of this multi-disciplinary project will be constantly&lt;br/&gt;coordinated by its P.I. (K. Likharev). In particular, regular meetings of all Stony Brook and&lt;br/&gt;Brookhaven participants of the team working on the project (including postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;associates and students), and annual meetings with Oak Ridge collaborators, are planned.</AbstractNarration>
