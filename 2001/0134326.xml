    <AbstractNarration>The PI is proposing to develop a new CFD code that will predict the coupled ventilation behavior of indoor and outdoor airspaces, including species (pollutants, chemical agents) transport. She will then couple this with large scale building energy simulation programs (already in existence) that do not contain sophisticated ventilation capabilities except on an energy balance basis. Validation, testing, and optimization of this computation "system" as a design tool is a major part of the proposed effort. Potential impacts include reliable design tools and guidelines for healthy and energy efficient buildings. In addition, the theory can be used to design mitigation strategies for chemical or biological agent attacks, such as determining the best sensing positions for quick responses to agent releases, activation of suitable ventilation systems to create a safe zone for occupants, and provision of suitable means to clean the buildings after an attack. It will also serve to bring architects and engineers more constructively together at the design phase. The education contribution of the research will include two new courses directed at architecture and engineering students in the areas of integrated building systems design and in the use of computational fluid dynamics in building systems design.</AbstractNarration>
