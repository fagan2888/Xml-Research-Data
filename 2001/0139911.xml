    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop rational and implementable methods &lt;br/&gt;to measure and control risk in the finance industry. The topic is timely &lt;br/&gt;because there have been some spectacular failures in the finance industry, &lt;br/&gt;because regulations are under discussion which would institutionalize &lt;br/&gt;quantitative risk measures, and because the leading risk measure, "value-&lt;br/&gt;at-risk," has undesirable properties. Chief among these is that in certain &lt;br/&gt;situations, situations that often arise in credit-risky markets, meeting &lt;br/&gt;regulatory value-at-risk requirements encourages concentration of risk &lt;br/&gt;rather than diversification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal builds on the idea of coherent risk measures developed by a &lt;br/&gt;team, which includes one of the principal investigators on this proposal. &lt;br/&gt;This team developed a set of axioms deemed to be desirable, and then &lt;br/&gt;characterized those "coherent" risk measures which satisfy these axioms. &lt;br/&gt;Their work showed that every coherent risk measure can be characterized &lt;br/&gt;by a set of probability measures over possible future scenarios. A three-&lt;br/&gt;part project is proposed. The first part is to develop a decentralized &lt;br/&gt;implementation of risk control based on coherent risk measurement. This &lt;br/&gt;requires development of duality theory and equilibrium pricing within a &lt;br/&gt;firm. The second is to elicit scenarios and estimate model parameters in &lt;br/&gt;real settings. This mandates refining the mathematical models to the point &lt;br/&gt;that a manageable number of measures over future scenarios present &lt;br/&gt;themselves, and appealing to statistical theory to make those choices. &lt;br/&gt;Finally, it is proposed to extend the existing theory of coherent risk &lt;br/&gt;measures. This project is being supported under the Focused Research &lt;br/&gt;Groups in the Mathematical Sciences activity.</AbstractNarration>
