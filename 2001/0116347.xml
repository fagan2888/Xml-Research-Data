    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Sudman at Tarleton State University to&lt;br/&gt;purchase an automated DNA analysis system. This instrument package will be&lt;br/&gt;used to enhance the teaching and research activities within the Department&lt;br/&gt;of Biological Sciences, specifically those related to molecular biology and&lt;br/&gt;genetics. The use of this DNA analysis system, combined with the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of DNA and protein analysis components into the laboratory&lt;br/&gt;portions of many of their classes, will greatly enhance the educational&lt;br/&gt;experiences of all of the students associated with the Biology Department.&lt;br/&gt;This modern, technological approach to biology will give Tarleton students&lt;br/&gt;advantages on three different levels. Exposure to modern research techniques&lt;br/&gt;and instrumentation will 1) better prepare the students to enter post-baccalaureate educational settings - either traditional academic settings or medical related fields; 2) prepare future K-12 teachers with a basis for explaining and perhaps demonstrating the uses of modern molecular&lt;br/&gt;techniques; and 3) prepare students for entrance into the rapidly changing,&lt;br/&gt;high-tech workplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From an educational standpoint, individuals that will benefit from the&lt;br/&gt;acquisition of a DNA analysis system will include undergraduate students,&lt;br/&gt;Masters level graduate students, area high school teachers, and researchers&lt;br/&gt;both at Tarleton State University and the Stephenville branch of the Texas&lt;br/&gt;A&amp;M Agricultural Research and Extension Center. Undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;enrolled in courses in the Department of Biological Sciences such as&lt;br/&gt;Heredity, Molecular Biology, and Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry will&lt;br/&gt;utilize the automated DNA analysis system in a variety of laboratory&lt;br/&gt;situations. Students in the graduate course Laboratory Practicum in&lt;br/&gt;Molecular Biology will also benefit from the apparatus. From a research&lt;br/&gt;standpoint, undergraduate and graduate students involved with several&lt;br/&gt;ongoing projects will directly utilize the automated DNA analysis system.&lt;br/&gt;These research projects include generating data for investigating the past&lt;br/&gt;history of various mammal species, DNA variation in an endangered bird&lt;br/&gt;(Attwater's prairie chickens), determination of the origin of introduced&lt;br/&gt;crabs in freshwater Texas lakes, introducing foreign genes into&lt;br/&gt;baculoviruses to enhance insect resistance in plants, examining the origin&lt;br/&gt;of specific "hybrid" plant species (such as peanuts), searching for genes&lt;br/&gt;related to drought tolerance in plants, and investigations into the genetic&lt;br/&gt;diversity of immune response genes in various species of mammals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this DNA analysis system will have a tremendous impact on&lt;br/&gt;the academic and research community associated with the Department of&lt;br/&gt;Biological Sciences at Tarleton State University. From students seeking&lt;br/&gt;teacher certification to those conducting Masters level research, an onsite&lt;br/&gt;instrument for determining DNA sequences or other genetic differences&lt;br/&gt;between or within organisms will provide a vital boost to the biological&lt;br/&gt;teaching and research fields. The automated DNA analysis system will allow&lt;br/&gt;more than 100 students per year the opportunity to obtain essential training&lt;br/&gt;with a state-of-the-art biochemical analysis instrument. Finally, the&lt;br/&gt;system will provide local access for the research community at the&lt;br/&gt;Stephenville branch of the Texas A&amp;M Agricultural Research and Extension&lt;br/&gt;Center, fostering additional collaborative research activities between the&lt;br/&gt;two institutions.</AbstractNarration>
