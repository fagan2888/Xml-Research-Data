    <AbstractNarration>0103944&lt;br/&gt;Olver&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will focus on the applications of the proposer's new &lt;br/&gt;equivariant theory of moving frames for general Lie group actions. &lt;br/&gt;Particular emphasis will be in three key applied directions: analysis and &lt;br/&gt;applications of invariant variational problems and invariant partial &lt;br/&gt;differential equations in geometry and physics, the design of symmetry-&lt;br/&gt;preserving numerical algorithms for approximating differential invariants &lt;br/&gt;and integrating invariant differential equations, and object recognition and &lt;br/&gt;symmetry detection in computer vision based on differential invariant and &lt;br/&gt;noise-resistant joint invariant signatures. The project will include further &lt;br/&gt;development of the underlying moving frame theory, particularly in the &lt;br/&gt;case of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-groups, and the formulation of a &lt;br/&gt;proper geometrical foundation for multivariate numerical approximation &lt;br/&gt;and interpolation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recognition and exploitation symmetry is an essential tool in modern &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and its applications. This project will continue to develop a &lt;br/&gt;new, powerful geometric approach, known as moving frames, to systems &lt;br/&gt;that have continuous symmetry. The modern moving frame theory &lt;br/&gt;developed by the PI has already witnessed a remarkable range of new &lt;br/&gt;applications, including computer vision, for object recognition and &lt;br/&gt;symmetry detection, a geometric approach to classical algebra and &lt;br/&gt;invariant theory, as well as the design of numerical integration schemes &lt;br/&gt;that preserve the underlying symmetry of the problem to be solved. The &lt;br/&gt;combination of analytical, geometrical, and numerical advances, coupled &lt;br/&gt;with practical applications has proved to be a particularly potent blend of &lt;br/&gt;theory and practical tools. This research project will continue the rapid &lt;br/&gt;development and application of the moving frame method, concentrating &lt;br/&gt;on theoretical developments tied to applications in computer vision, in &lt;br/&gt;geometry and physics, and in symmetry-based numerical integration &lt;br/&gt;methods</AbstractNarration>
