    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the University of Maryland-College Park for the support of a five-year, REU Site " Research Internships in Telecommunications Engineering-RITE Site," under the direction of Dr. Steven I. Marcus. This eleven-week summer program will involve twenty-two students annually in a diverse research experience on a wide range of topics in the field of Telecommunications including communications systems and theory, networking, signal processing, multimedia technology, information security, and neuromorphic engineering. Each student will work in small groups (2-3 students) with faculty members and graduate students. In addition to the fundamental aspects of engineering disciplines, aspects of existing programs that combine engineering and business perspectives will be incorporated into the RITE students' experiences. The students will participate in industrial site visits and interactions and will work closely with graduate research assistant mentors throughout their summer research experience.</AbstractNarration>
