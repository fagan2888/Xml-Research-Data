    <AbstractNarration>This project will continue work on developing equipment and methodology to monitor complex polymerization reactions in real time. Such a capability could benefit both academic and industrial scientists nd engineers. At the fundamental level, polymer chemists can immediately observe the effects of different synthetic strategies, monomers, initiators, and other factors and how they influence kinetics and ploymer properties. This could advance the discovery of new materials. Industrial researchers could use it as a tool for pilot plant optimization of industrial processes. One goal of the work is to apply the methodology to full scale industrial reactors, integrated into a feedback loop than can control reactions. This in turn could lead to better uses of non-renewable resources, reactor and personnel time, conserve energy, lead to less pollution, and enhance product quality. The fundamental work to be done is threefold: 1) Extension of the PI's "Automatic, Continuous Monitoring of Polymer Reaction" or "ACOMP" to copolymerization, controlled radicl polymerization, and emulsion polymerization. This includes development of instrumentation, software, theory, and kinetic modeling to deal with these complex reactions. 2) Further develop and use associated, automated equilibrium characterization and modeling techniques for to the behavior of the polymers whose growth was monitored. This includes auto-assocition, and interactions in multi-component solutions; e.g. those involving polymer, solvent, micelles and slts. 3) Introduction o simultaneous multiple sample light scattering to high throughput screening in polymerization and other polymer-based kinetic processes. It is expected that this portion will provide new tools for polymer discovery and synthesis. The project has potential infrastructure benefits in that students trained in developing this methodoloty would be of great use to industry.</AbstractNarration>
