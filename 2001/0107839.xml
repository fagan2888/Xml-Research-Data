    <AbstractNarration>Grid Forum is a grass-roots community organization that began as a BOF session at SC98 in November&lt;br/&gt;1998. Grid Forum has held five highly successful workshops in the US since that time and has formed ten&lt;br/&gt;focused working groups, each developing best practices and standards within a particular set of technical&lt;br/&gt;areas. Over 500 individuals participate in Grid Forum electronic newsgroups and typical workshop&lt;br/&gt;attendance is 150-190 people. Grid Forum has served as the primary gathering point and collaboration&lt;br/&gt;vehicle for major initiatives including the NSF Partnerships for Advanced Computational Infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;(PACI) program, NASA's Information Power Grid (IPG) program, the DoD modernization program, DOE&lt;br/&gt;grid-based programs, and others.&lt;br/&gt;Two of the primary advantages to the existence of such a collaboration vehicle are that it allows these&lt;br/&gt;programs to leverage one another and it assures that the various agency-specific grid systems are able to&lt;br/&gt;interoperate. During the past year, Grid Forum has joined with similar efforts in Europe and Asia-Pacific,&lt;br/&gt;increasing the opportunity to leverage to major grid projects outside of the US. Beyond the advantages of&lt;br/&gt;leverage and ensuring interoperability, a single global standards activity ensures that grid technologies do&lt;br/&gt;not fragment at continental boundaries.&lt;br/&gt;Grid Forum will hold its sixth major workshop, "Global Grid Forum 1" in Amsterdam in March 2001.&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will be held in conjunction with the kick-off meeting for the European Data Grid project&lt;br/&gt;that is managed by CERN. This project supports travel by approximately 30 US participants, including students and researchers from Minority Serving Institutions, to that meeting. The participants will be&lt;br/&gt;recruited from the ranks of existing Grid Forum leaders.</AbstractNarration>
