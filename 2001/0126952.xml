    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary goal of this project is to increase student achievement and success in developmental algebra. The project is attaining this goal by implementing reforms in the areas of pedagogy and course administration. To support the implementation of these reforms, a technology-enhanced Mathematics Learning Laboratory (MLL) is dedicated to the mathematical development of over 1000 underprepared students each year. Reform in course administration includes a competency-based approach permitting students to have multiple tries to pass electronically generated and graded examinations. Pedagogy reforms are focusing on a blend of technology-based assessment, student tutorials, and classroom instruction, that is transforming the classroom into an active learning environment where the mathematical needs of each individual student can be met.A key part of our plan draws upon the NSF funded project, An Expert System For The Efficient Assessment of Mathematical Knowledge ( NSF ESI-9350484 ), which is being used by students to assess their existing levels of mathematical knowledge. This project is also adapting and implementing themes and techniques from two previous NSF supported projects: Connected Mathematics and Interactive Mathematics Program.</AbstractNarration>
