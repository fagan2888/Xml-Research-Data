    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Ron Milligan at The Scripps Research Institute to purchase an electron microscope. This is an advanced research instrument that can be used to record images of biological specimens at magnifications of up to 500,000X. The instrument will be used to visualize and image proteins and large assemblies composed of many different molecules that occurs inside cells and enable them to carry out various functions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of the user group focuses on three-dimensional (3D) molecular microscopy: determination of the near-atomic, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of molecules and macromolecular assemblies by cryo-electron microscopy and image analysis. The common goal of the user group is to calculate 3D structures of biological molecules and macromolecular complexes to determine how they work. Some of the work to be carried out on the instrument includes investigations of: proteins that bind to microtubules and stabilize them, motor proteins that move along microtubules, toxins from bacteria that punch holes in cells, proteins that facilitate fusion of membrane-bound compartments in cells, protein assemblies that read off (transcribe) the genome in the nucleus, membrane proteins that act as pumps, channels or signaling complexes, and plant and animal viruses. The superior performance of the new microscope is essential for getting the best possible results in these studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work to be undertaken is of fundamental biological importance. The results will provide insight in to many of the basic processes that occur inside cells and are essential for life. At The Scripps Research institute, the instrument will be used by 6 research groups. 12 postdoctoral associates and 6 graduate students will receive advanced training in structural biology using this instrument. 10-20 research professionals will use the instrument in the course of their work. Visiting researchers from elsewhere in the US and overseas are anticipated. The proposed new instrument will be integrated into existing EM management plan as well as training, education and outreach activities at The Scripps Research Institute. This will create a unique research and training facility, which will have a major impact on the regional, national and international research infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
