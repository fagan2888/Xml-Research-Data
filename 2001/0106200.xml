    <AbstractNarration>The modular representation theory of finite groups of Lie&lt;br/&gt;type is a major, active topic of mathematical research. &lt;br/&gt;The area has both inspired and been strongly&lt;br/&gt;influenced by developments in other areas, e.g., &lt;br/&gt;the cohomology of groups and Lie algebras,&lt;br/&gt;quantum groups, characteristic zero representation theory,&lt;br/&gt;perverse sheaves, and the theory of finite dimensional algebras.&lt;br/&gt;The project treats both the&lt;br/&gt;describing and non-describing theories. The &lt;br/&gt;describing (resp., nondescribing) theory concerns &lt;br/&gt;the modular representations in which the underlying module &lt;br/&gt;is taken over a field having the same (resp., different) &lt;br/&gt;characteristic as the defining characteristic of the group. &lt;br/&gt;In the describing theory, the investigators look for &lt;br/&gt;an increased role of the relatively&lt;br/&gt;unexplored area of affine Lie algebra representations in&lt;br/&gt;positive characteristic. In the non-describing theory,&lt;br/&gt;they plan to attack several important conjectures &lt;br/&gt;aimed at finding a unified approach valid for all types. &lt;br/&gt;They also continue to explore possible analogies between the two theories.&lt;br/&gt;Finally, Parshall continues his recent work on cohomology&lt;br/&gt;computations, while Scott extends his recent computational work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In mathematics, a "group" is an abstract embodiment of symmetry. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to applications to other parts of mathematics, concrete &lt;br/&gt;realizations of groups can provide powerful constraints on the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;complicated physical and communications systems. This project concentrates&lt;br/&gt;on determining the ways in which the most important abstract finite groups&lt;br/&gt;find concrete representations as square matrices over finite number systems.&lt;br/&gt;The groups and representations the investigators study comprise the most&lt;br/&gt;important basic ingredients for creating a general theory of all finite&lt;br/&gt;group representations. Over the past century, similar theories for&lt;br/&gt;continuous groups have played a large role in quantum theory and the theory&lt;br/&gt;of elementary particles. Their finite analogs have already proved valuable&lt;br/&gt;in the design of communications and data storage devices, though this finite&lt;br/&gt;theory remains very incomplete. In the future, one reasonably expects that&lt;br/&gt;the finite discrete worlds of computers and communications will become even&lt;br/&gt;more important. The task of creating a viable general theory of finite group&lt;br/&gt;representations -- as is the investigators' long-term goal -- is, thus, a&lt;br/&gt;central problem for the future.</AbstractNarration>
