    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to develop a general synthesis of chiral oxazolines, which can be applied to the discovery of enantioselective olefin epoxidation catalysts using molecular oxygen as a terminal oxidant. Further, a general synthesis of chiral pyridine ligands for application to an asymmetric allylic displacement will be sought. The educational focus of the project is to incorporate, into the curriculum, the relationship of current applications in synthetic organic chemistry to the fundamentals physical organic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this CAREER proposal, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and teaching efforts of Dr. Matthew Sigman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. Professor Sigman will focus his work on developing new chiral ligands for applications in asymmetric synthesis. The ligands will be assembled in a systematic manner in order to allow for optimization and direct insight into reaction mechanisms. This type of methodology development presents opportunities for the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries. Dr. Sigman's educational activities will be focused on improving the organic chemistry curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
