    <AbstractNarration>Solow&lt;br/&gt;0109738&lt;br/&gt; There are certain confluences involving graphs in physics,&lt;br/&gt;molecular biology, number theory, Teichmueller theory, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems, fluid dynamics, and 3-manifold invariants, which in turn&lt;br/&gt;reflect possibly deeper relations among their theoretical&lt;br/&gt;foundations which have yet to be developed. The investigators&lt;br/&gt;organize a workshop to consider mathematical structures with&lt;br/&gt;application to specific problems in fields increasingly connected&lt;br/&gt;to mathematics, for example the global geometry of macromolecular&lt;br/&gt;folding, including both proteins and RNA. Recent mathematical&lt;br/&gt;results allow for a treatment of the full spatial folding&lt;br/&gt;problem: how do the physico-chemical properties of macromolecules&lt;br/&gt;determine their spatial folding characteristics? Roughly,&lt;br/&gt;folding can be modeled as a family of weighted arcs, each arc&lt;br/&gt;corresponding to a chemical bond, the weight the Boltzmann&lt;br/&gt;strength of the bond. The graphs formed from combining these&lt;br/&gt;weighted ars give a space of weghted graphs representing all&lt;br/&gt;possible foldings. Can an appropriate energy functional be found&lt;br/&gt;on such a space to study the gradient flow minimizing the total&lt;br/&gt;energy? Several participants use this approach to understand&lt;br/&gt;dynamic folding. Related spaces of graphs in biology are those of&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic trees formed by speciation. Though the global&lt;br/&gt;geometry of these spaces is understood, the nature of the local&lt;br/&gt;geometry is not known; some of the participants study these&lt;br/&gt;questions. A recent discovery in string theory is the exotic&lt;br/&gt;structure of an "operad" associated with spaces of graphs. Some&lt;br/&gt;of the researchers at the workshop investigate these higher order&lt;br/&gt;structures, and their possible use in biology.&lt;br/&gt; Graph theory is a branch of mathematics dealing with objects&lt;br/&gt;called graphs. A graph consists of a set of points or vertices&lt;br/&gt;that are connected by links or edges. An ordinary map, for&lt;br/&gt;example, is a graph whose vertices are towns and whose edges are&lt;br/&gt;roads. Although graphs are abstract objects, they have been used&lt;br/&gt;to represent a wide variety of real objects or processes. A&lt;br/&gt;familiar use of graphs is to represent the evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;relationships between a group of organisms -- family trees. It is&lt;br/&gt;a testimony to their great versatility and usefulness that graphs&lt;br/&gt;have been used in fields as diverse as biology, economics, and&lt;br/&gt;computer science. In the field of biotechnology, there has been&lt;br/&gt;an explosion in the use of graphs to represent the complex&lt;br/&gt;physical structure of the basic proteins produced by DNA. This&lt;br/&gt;work has important applications in understanding genetic diseases&lt;br/&gt;and in designing medicines to cure them. Because methods based on&lt;br/&gt;graph theory have been developed independently in many fields, it&lt;br/&gt;is extremely likely that sharing problems and results between&lt;br/&gt;fields will lead to advances. The purpose of this workshop is to&lt;br/&gt;bring together mathematicians and biologists working on problems&lt;br/&gt;involving graph theory to describe and discuss their work in an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary setting.</AbstractNarration>
