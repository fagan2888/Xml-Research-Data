    <AbstractNarration>Pilyugin&lt;br/&gt;0124610&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues organize a conference on&lt;br/&gt;theoretical immunology. The field of theoretical immunology has&lt;br/&gt;become a prominent direction in biomathematics and it concerns&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling of the biocomplexity in the immune system,&lt;br/&gt;and more specifically the generation of immune responses to&lt;br/&gt;infections, generation and maintenance of immune memory,&lt;br/&gt;understanding the mechanisms that govern persistent infections,&lt;br/&gt;designing optimal strategies for antibiotic treatment of&lt;br/&gt;infectious diseases, and vaccine development. The main goals of&lt;br/&gt;this conference are to advance the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and experimental directions of immunological research&lt;br/&gt;and to facilitate a better communication between science and&lt;br/&gt;medicine. The conference focuses on modern approaches to&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling of immune processes using differential&lt;br/&gt;equations and dynamical systems, game theory, mathematical&lt;br/&gt;statistics, stochastic processes and computer simulations, as&lt;br/&gt;well as mathematical algorithms for data mining and data fitting.&lt;br/&gt;The conference features lectures by prominent scientists on&lt;br/&gt;fundamental results in the field as well as reports on work in&lt;br/&gt;progress. A special session is devoted to the discussion of new&lt;br/&gt;directions and most significant problems of theoretical&lt;br/&gt;immunology in the near future.&lt;br/&gt; The immune system is our primary defense against viruses and&lt;br/&gt;infections. Theoretical immunology is a relatively young field of&lt;br/&gt;science that deals with theoretical modeling of interactions&lt;br/&gt;between immune system and invading parasites. Mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computer models are used to unify our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;extremely complex functioning of the immune system. Such&lt;br/&gt;theoretical models allow scientists to sort through the growing&lt;br/&gt;wealth of experimental and clinical data and extract&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally important features of immunity, design new&lt;br/&gt;experiments, and optimize the performance of drugs and vaccines.&lt;br/&gt;The meeting aims to bridge the gap between theoretical and&lt;br/&gt;experimental biology and medicine and advance the theory of&lt;br/&gt;immune processes to address the current needs of medicine and&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology. The conference has an educational impact by&lt;br/&gt;exposing younger researchers and graduate students to the present&lt;br/&gt;challenges in immunology and facilitating their future scientific&lt;br/&gt;careers.</AbstractNarration>
