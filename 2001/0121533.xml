    <AbstractNarration>This is a research project in the design and implementation of novel Human Computer Interfaces for educational use in structural molecular biology. This project will explore, define, and assess the role of computer-generated physical models in teaching scientific content and concepts. The purpose is to enhance the understanding and communication of the complex world of life's molecular machinery to a broad community. Using structural data on biological molecules and their complexes, the participants will prototype novel physical models via automated design and fabrication technologies and develop replication processes for broader distribution. The models will be used directly for enhance visualization and as input/output devices that interactively integrate with commutation and computer graphics for information retrieval, manipulation, and simulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide new, tangible modes of interacting with, and understanding of, both the fundamental concepts and the complex data that are coming from the rapid advances in genomics, proteomics, and other areas of structural molecular biology. It will enable a broad range of students to learn, query, and explore in a field of growing scientific and social importance - the molecular basis of life. Physical models will give both haptic and visual support of the importance of shape in biological function. Use of physical models as tangible computer interfaces will revolutionize how students explore and understand biomolecular structure, interaction, and function.</AbstractNarration>
