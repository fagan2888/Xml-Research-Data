    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0103877&lt;br/&gt;John W. Morgan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work proposed to be carried out under this grant concerns mathematical formulation and proof of some of the mathematical dualities arising from high energy physics. The first duality &lt;br/&gt;to be studied concerns the F-theory/heterotic string duality. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical formulation of the duality is that for a &lt;br/&gt;certain range of parameters the moduli spaces of classical &lt;br/&gt;vacua for various compactifications of F-theory and of &lt;br/&gt;heterotic string theory should be isomorphic. We conjecture &lt;br/&gt;that the appropriate mathematical statement is that the &lt;br/&gt;moduli spaces of heterotic vacua are non-normal infinite-sheeted coverings of the F-theory moduli space associated with &lt;br/&gt;maximal parabolic subgroups of the fundamental group of &lt;br/&gt;the F-theory moduli space. These maximal parabolic subgroups &lt;br/&gt;are the fundamental groups of neighborhoods of certain &lt;br/&gt;divisors at infinity. This study involves a detailed analysis &lt;br/&gt;of the moduli space of semi-stable principal bundles over &lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves as well as the notions of differential &lt;br/&gt;cohomology. The second duality is the famous quantum field &lt;br/&gt;theory duality between SU(2) Yang-Mills theory and the &lt;br/&gt;abelian Seiberg-Witten theory. These dual descriptions &lt;br/&gt;are simply the high and low energy limits of a twisted &lt;br/&gt;version of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. One part of &lt;br/&gt;a mathematical understanding of this duality involves &lt;br/&gt;giving precise mathematical formulations of the high and &lt;br/&gt;low energy limits of the twisted supersymmetric theory &lt;br/&gt;and showing how certain correlation functions in this &lt;br/&gt;twisted theory converge in the sense of perturbation &lt;br/&gt;theory to the usual Donaldson polynomial invariants in the &lt;br/&gt;high energy limit and to the Seiberg-Witten invariants in &lt;br/&gt;the low energy limit. This part of the story is surely &lt;br/&gt;amenable to rigorous mathematical formulation. The &lt;br/&gt;more ambitious goal is to find some mathematical &lt;br/&gt;formalism which allows for a mathematically rigorous &lt;br/&gt;interpelation between these two limits -- a mathematical &lt;br/&gt;substitute for the mathematically undefined quantum &lt;br/&gt;field theory -- which would allow one to compare the &lt;br/&gt;high and low energy limits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The connection between mathematics and high energy &lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics has always been a close one. In the &lt;br/&gt;last few years it has taken on new aspects. With the &lt;br/&gt;study of global issues in quantum field theory and string &lt;br/&gt;theory has come a new level of interaction between geometry &lt;br/&gt;and topology and these areas of theoretical physics. Belief &lt;br/&gt;in the existence of these (to date non-rigorous) physics &lt;br/&gt;theories leads physicists to make predictions, i.e., &lt;br/&gt;conjectures in mathematics. In a strange way these &lt;br/&gt;conjectures play the role that physical predictions used &lt;br/&gt;to play. Now the physicists take confirmation that they are &lt;br/&gt;on the right track when these mathematical predictions can &lt;br/&gt;be verified by rigorous mathematics, which, since it is &lt;br/&gt;rigorous, can not make use of the quantum field theory &lt;br/&gt;paradigms that we used to make the prediction in the &lt;br/&gt;first place. The interest in mathematics of this interplay &lt;br/&gt;is that the sorts of mathematical statements that are &lt;br/&gt;predicted in this way have turned out to be quite novel &lt;br/&gt;producing conjectures unlike anything that had been seen &lt;br/&gt;before. Much of the progress the last ten or fifteen years &lt;br/&gt;in large areas of geometry and topology traces back to this &lt;br/&gt;source. One of the most fruitful sources of mathematical &lt;br/&gt;conjectures has been various dualities in physics. These &lt;br/&gt;occur when there is more than one classical mathematical &lt;br/&gt;limit of a quantum field theory or string theory. The &lt;br/&gt;mathematical objects that arise in the description of &lt;br/&gt;the classical limits then are related because they are &lt;br/&gt;limits of a single quantum field theory or string theory. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical problem is always the same -- define &lt;br/&gt;rigorously what the relationship is and then establish it mathematically. The work proposed here is exactly along &lt;br/&gt;these lines for two such dualities.</AbstractNarration>
