    <AbstractNarration>0114572&lt;br/&gt;Lombardi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. John Lombardi, Department of Chemistry, CUNY City College, New York, NY and Dr. Serdar Ozcelik, Department of Chemistry, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey. They plan to investigate the electro-optical properties of J-aggregates. They plan to measure the change in dipole moments to study the nature and relative importance of the intermolecular interactions that lead to aggregate formation. They will study the effects of electric fields on molecular events (absorption and fluorescence) to gain basic understanding of nanostructural materials that would be useful in nanotechnology. They plan to utilize Stark spectroscopic methods for these studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The project supports collaboration between two scientists with complementary expertise and resources to investigate an important problem. The results will help with designing of materials useful for nanotechnology applications. Professor Lombardi is an expert in Stark spectroscopy. He will advise on building up a Stark spectrometer at Bilkent University and will participate in the analysis and simulation of the electroabsorption data. Dr. Ozcelik will supervise the preparation of the film sample, UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence, electroabsorption and electric field modulated fluorescence measurements. Students at CCNY/CUNY will benefit from this collaboration, and one graduate student will visit Bilkent University to work on the project. This project meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest.</AbstractNarration>
