    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funds to support experimental studies of heavy quark physics with the BaBar Collaboration at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. The proposed research centers on the study of hadronic decays of the B-meson. Such studies are challenging both theoretically, since they are difficult to calculate from first principles using Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD), and experimentally, since they occur with very small branching ratios. One focus will be on the study of color-suppressed B decays, such as Bo ? Dopo, and tests of factorization that express one matrix element which is the product of two weak currents as the product of matrix elements of two single-currents. The second area of study will be that of semi-leptonic B decays into non-charm mesons, such as B ? pln. The goal here is to measure the CKM matrix element Vub and test factorization for B-meson decays into two light mesons.</AbstractNarration>
