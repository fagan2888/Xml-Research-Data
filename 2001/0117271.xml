    <AbstractNarration>Talley/0117271&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is an experiment conducted as a rapid response to the &lt;br/&gt;anomalously cold winter conditions over eastern Siberia. Mid-winter&lt;br/&gt;conditions appear to be comparable to those seen in 1976. The goals &lt;br/&gt;are to discover the depth to which deep convection penetrates under &lt;br/&gt;such conditions in the Sea of Japan, the size of a typical convective &lt;br/&gt;patch, and the properties of the dense water formed. The experiment &lt;br/&gt;consists of a short cruise into a part of the Sea of Japan south of &lt;br/&gt;Vladivostok. The choice of location is based on survey work conducted &lt;br/&gt;last winter as part of a large ONR-sponsored experiment in the Japan &lt;br/&gt;Sea, recent AVHRR imagery, and recent data from a PALACE float in the &lt;br/&gt;Sea of Japan. Deep CTD and bottle casts will be made at approximately &lt;br/&gt;34 stations south of Peter the Great Bay. The endeavor is a &lt;br/&gt;collaboration between U.S. and Russian oceanographers.</AbstractNarration>
