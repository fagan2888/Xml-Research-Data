    <AbstractNarration>Astronomy (11) The project is developing a prototype and evaluating &lt;br/&gt;Interactive Astronomy, a multimedia instructional package for a widely taught undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;science course: Introductory Astronomy for Non-Science Majors. This course serves a great &lt;br/&gt;number of college students, including many future teachers, and has great potential for improving &lt;br/&gt;their science skills and influencing their understanding of and appreciation for science. &lt;br/&gt;The multimedia package includes software which incorporates two &lt;br/&gt;innovative elements: the revolutionary improvements in instruction offered by information &lt;br/&gt;technology, and the emerging paradigm of inquiry-based learning. Utilizing the high degree of &lt;br/&gt;interactivity which computers make possible, students are led to discover things for &lt;br/&gt;themselves, as opposed to learning them passively. Utilizing the dynamical simulations which &lt;br/&gt;computers make possible, students can live in the world of science, yielding a vivid experience &lt;br/&gt;of its normally abstract world. Two important elements of the package are &lt;br/&gt;Guided Discoveries, which are extensive, highly interactive instructional exercises, designed &lt;br/&gt;with careful attention to pedagogical issues; and Intelligent Tutors, which customize their &lt;br/&gt;instructional strategies, based on an assessment of the student's learning needs. &lt;br/&gt;Design of seven of the Discoveries has already been completed. In this project, three are being&lt;br/&gt;fully implemented, and then a proof of concept test is conducted of their effect on student learning. &lt;br/&gt;This formative evaluation (to be conducted in the Fall at Greenfield Community College and &lt;br/&gt;Amherst College, and in the Spring at the University of Massachusetts) runs parallel to, and &lt;br/&gt;be interactive with, further software development.</AbstractNarration>
