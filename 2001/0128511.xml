    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will focus on the development of an electrochemically operated organic peroxy acid generator. Peroxyacids are popular disinfectants that can eliminate even resistant microorganisms (i.e. spores, viruses). Peracids produce biodegradable end products, are effective at dilute concentrations (ppm levels), are safe for use even in food preparation applications, and are thus applicable to many point-of-use applications in homes, restaurants and hospitals. These include the use of peroxylactic or peroxyacetic acids for diverse uses, including: i) preventing the&lt;br/&gt;build up of heterotrophic bacteria in water treatment appliances, ii) destroying pathogens in water and on food surfaces, iii) sterilizing medical devices, and iv) sanitizing food processing equipment by incorporating a clean-in-place capability. The conventional method of manufacturing peroxy acids involves mixing concentrated hydrogen peroxide, organic acid, and inorganic acid catalyst (concentrated sulfuric acid) with numerous stabilizers and additives. In the proposed method, peracids can be generated and used on demand using oxygen or air, thus eliminating the need for hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid. In Phase I, optimization of the electrocatalyst (to improve current and energy efficiencies), preliminary cell design and catalyst configuration, and biocidal properties of the peracid product will be conducted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a considerable need for miniature and scalable clean-in-place devices in point-of-use applications in homes, hotels, food service establishments and hospitals. Many equipment manufacturers are trying to incorporate a self cleaning capability into their existing product lines due to concerns of microbial contamination, especially one that requires minimal user interaction, is cost effective, and environmentally friendly. In water treatment applications alone, the market for these decives is estimated to be over $1billion annually in the U.S. and $3 billion worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
