    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop techniques and equipment for simple, cheap and reliable mass production of triploid and tetraploid giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) using a new technology called Automated Polyploid Induction System (APIS). This proprietary APIS system uses a specially designed spawning tank, an automated spawn sensing device and computer applied shock treatments. The specific objective of the Phase I project is to determine the optimal values of the three key parameters for triploidy induction in P. monodon: time to start shock application, shock intensity, and shock duration. This determination will allow the complete development and demonstration of APIS during Phase II of the project. Additional objectives in Phase II will include production of tetraploid P. monodon, and completion of production trials with diploid, triploid and tetraploid shrimp. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project is in the farmed shrimp production market. Farmed shrimp from Asia constitutes approximately 75% of the world's farmed shrimp production, and P. monodon accounts for greater than 50% of that production. Successful mass production of the triploid P. monodon, and demonstration of superior culture performance of triploids will allow marketing of this proprietary technology throughout Asia.</AbstractNarration>
