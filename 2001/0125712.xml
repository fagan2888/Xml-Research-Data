    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal focuses on improvements in the Instrumental Analysis and Physical Chemistry laboratories, in the undergraduate research program, and in the enhancement of collaborative efforts across disciplines fostered by the acquisition of an LC-MS. Experiments are being adapted from the research and educational literature and implemented into the undergraduate curriculum. In the Instrumental Analysis laboratory, students are performing project-based, comprehensive investigations typical of those they will be expected to carry out once employed in an industrial setting. Each project involves real world problems, utilizes several instruments, includes a literature review, method development, and laboratory preparation, and requires 2-4 weeks for completion. The LC-MS is playing a significant role in several of these projects. The instrument is also being used extensively in undergraduate research, both within the Department and in collaboration with faculty members outside the Department.</AbstractNarration>
