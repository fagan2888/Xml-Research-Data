    <AbstractNarration>0137066&lt;br/&gt;Vary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports US-India cooperative research entitled Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) - A Light Front Hamiltonian Approach. US investigator James Vary, Iowa State University (ISU) and Indian scientist Avaroth Harindranath, Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), Calcutta will develop a new approach to solve for spectra and other properties of the elementary particles, which features the union of two major theoretical tools in physics. They will derive the Hamiltonian governing the dynamics from the light-front quantized theory of the strong interactions, QCD and then, they will solve for the wavefunctions of baryons and mesons expressed as amplitudes of multi-quark multi-gluon configurations using their newly developed methods of quantum many-body theory. The investigators expect to resolve several outstanding problems in nuclear physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This activity has the potential to begin a strong collaboration between ISU and SINP. ISU has developed strength in microscopic nuclear theory and in the fundamental theory of strong interactions, as well as strong expertise in computational physics. SINP has a very strong tradition of basic research in physics; Harindranath has extensive experience in Light Front Quantization and in Hamiltonian-based methods in quantum field theory, which are central to this research. This award will greatly benefit US-Indo contacts and will provide highly deserved support to a very talented Indian theorist. The Office of International Science &amp; Engineering and the Division of Physics are cofunders of this activity. On the Indian side, the Department of Science and Technology (DST) supports this activity under the NSF/DST joint program.</AbstractNarration>
