    <AbstractNarration>Our dependence on fossil fuel is causing social, political, technological, economical, and environmental problems. The search for alternative energy has given us many choices for replacing fossil-based energy. However, the choices come with their own set of advantages, disadvantages, and risks. This integrated research and education project will prepare students for solving energy problems involving alternative energy sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to make the best use of available energy sources by combining them. Energy sources, including photovoltaic, hydrogen, and wind, each can be converted to electrical energy such that it can be combined efficiently. The most effective means to combine and manipulate electricity is power electronics. In this project, new power electronic converters will be developed that combine multiple energy sources in an optimal way. This not only requires advances in control and topology - as multiple-input power converter technology is undeveloped - but will also require a thorough assessment of trade-offs in combining different energy sources. This will be supported by improved energy awareness among all engineering students through new courses and through more integration of energy-related topics in existing coursework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research portion of the project will culminate in both theoretical algorithms and a hardware demonstration. The prototype will combine energy from at least three different sources and will power at least two varieties of loads. It is intended that this will be the first converter of its kind, and inspire a new approach to electric power</AbstractNarration>
