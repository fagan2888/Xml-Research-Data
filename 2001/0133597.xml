    <AbstractNarration>0133597&lt;br/&gt;Saugata Basu&lt;br/&gt;Georgia Tech&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Algorithmic Semi-algebraic Geometry and its Applications&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry lies at the heart of of many problems in several different areas of computer science and mathematics including discrete and computational geometry, robot motion planning, geometric modeling, computer-aided design, geometric theorem proving, mathematical investigations of real algebraic varieties, molecular chemistry, constraint databases etc. A closely related subject area is &lt;br/&gt;quantitative real algebraic geometry. Results from quantitative real algebraic geometry are the basic &lt;br/&gt;ingredients of better algorithms in semi-algebraic geometry and play an increasingly important role in several other areas of computer science: for instance, in bounding the geometric complexity of arrangements in computational geometry, computational learning theory, proving lower bounds in computational complexity theory, convex optimization problems etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of this project is to design optimal algorithms for several important problems of semi-algebraic geometry including the problems of computing the homology groups and stratifications of semi-algebraic sets.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the methods and techniques of algorithmic real algebraic geometry will be applied to investigate &lt;br/&gt;several open problems in discrete and computational geometry and to explore new connections, especially &lt;br/&gt;in the area of computational topology. At the same time, several emerging applications of algorithmic semi-algebraic geometry will be investigated, especially in the area of constraint databases.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, practical implementations will be undertaken, in order to build a system able to compute topological invariants (such as the number of connected components, the Euler characteristic, the Betti numbers, the full homology groups) of given semi-algebraic sets. This will aim at bridging the current gap between the theoretically best algorithms, and the best practical implementations available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational component of the project consists of developing an integrated cross-disciplinary &lt;br/&gt;curriculum suitable for advanced under-graduate and beginning graduate students in mathematics and computer science. This would require no pre-requisite beyond college-level calculus and linear algebra, so that that the students can quickly absorb the mathematical background necessary for this line of research, and at the same time be in a position to make efficient implementations, which would make them&lt;br/&gt;attractive to both industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>
