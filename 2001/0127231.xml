    <AbstractNarration>Computer Engineering (32)&lt;br/&gt;Traditional undergraduate instruction in process control focuses on abstract analysis and often does not prepare students for the industrially important task of synthesizing process control strategies and designs. The key goal of our project has been to bridge this chasm between academics and industry by developing and incorporating into the curriculum inexpensive and flexible process control lab kits that will allow students to design, implement and test their own control systems. The students will have the important tasks of determining the placement of sensors and control elements, and the nature of the control strategy. With our kits, students conduct several flow, level and temperature experiments, which illustrate concepts from simple draining tank dynamics through the implementation of advanced multi-loop control systems. In this project, the needed components, a software control system, and student instructions have been developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because our kits are inherently safe and require only electrical power and water to run, they can be used for laboratories, classroom demos and exercises, independent activities, distance learning and for educational outreach to high school students. In the future, kits could be adapted to provide experiments for a range of engineering courses including Introduction to Engineering, Material and Energy Balances, Unit Operations and Reactor Design. Evaluation of the kits and materials developed have been conducted at Lafayette College. Rowan University and Manhattan College have completed additional testing.</AbstractNarration>
