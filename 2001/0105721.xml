    <AbstractNarration>An undesired consequence of the growing parallelism of modern processors is that it is dramatically more difficult to separate the events that limit execution speed from the &gt;events whose latencies are tolerated. A method for focusing design effort is critical-path analysis. This research proposes to apply critical-path &lt;br/&gt;analysis at the micro-architectural level, with the goal of detecting and eliminating execution bottlenecks.&lt;br/&gt;This research will explore the potential of the critical path in four interrelated efforts: (1) Modeling the micro-architectural critical path. The main task is to define a model of the critical path, i.e., the set of events and dependences in a micro-execution that will be exposed in the dependence graph on which the critical path&lt;br/&gt;will be computed. (2) Efficient tracing of the critical path. This effort will develop an on-line algorithm that will use a last-arrival edge at each node to calculate the critical path in one pass in a simulator. (3) Hardware critical-path predictors. This research will explore the use of approximation methods in avoiding the analysis of the entire dependence graph. (4) Criticality-aware processor policies. This research will&lt;br/&gt;use hardware critical-path predictors to focus hardware policies on events likely to be on the critical path.</AbstractNarration>
