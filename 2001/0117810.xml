    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for research in the design, implementation, and instrumentation of new&lt;br/&gt;methods for scalable wide-area on-demand reliable digital (SWORD) streaming. The larger goal of the&lt;br/&gt;research is to enable new streaming media applications, such as immediate access to a television show&lt;br/&gt;whenever a client anywhere would like to view it, by devising new practical cost-effective methods for on-demand real-time streaming of very popular streaming media content. The key aspects of the research to&lt;br/&gt;be undertaken are:&lt;br/&gt;1. The development of innovative practical new reliable multicast techniques that optimize client stream&lt;br/&gt;sharing to conserve server and network bandwidth, improve bandwidth cost-sharing, and maximize&lt;br/&gt;system scalability.&lt;br/&gt;2. The design of delivery techniques that work over the Internet or over satellite/cable networks, or any&lt;br/&gt;combination of these network technologies.&lt;br/&gt;3. The development of new metrics and models to determine which popular streams or partial streams&lt;br/&gt;should be cached at regional (or proxy) servers in order to minimize delivery cost for the data.&lt;br/&gt;4. The development of new network instrumentation facilities for the streaming media delivery protocols&lt;br/&gt;that enable deep understanding of the impact of network events and conditions on the performance of&lt;br/&gt;the protocols.&lt;br/&gt;5. The use of the new on-line network instrumentation facilities to develop new streaming methods that&lt;br/&gt;optimally adapt to current network conditions.&lt;br/&gt;6. The development of a novel testbed that allows experimentation with alternative new reliable multicast&lt;br/&gt;methods as well as alternative algorithms for caching streaming content closer to the clients, uses the&lt;br/&gt;new instrumentation facilities, and operates seamlessly and transparently in a live environment with&lt;br/&gt;ordinary clients accessing widely used media servers over large-scale networks such as Internet2 or the&lt;br/&gt;Internet MBONE.</AbstractNarration>
