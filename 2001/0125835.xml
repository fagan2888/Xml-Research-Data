    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;We are using an automated atomic absorption spectrometer, an automated HPLC, and equipment for microwave digestions and extractions to enhance students learning in analytical chemistry and applying the knowledge gained to other chemistry courses in the physical and biological sciences and to research projects. We are adapting a number of problem-based laboratories from literature such as the environmental monitoring of urban air or trout streams and the analysis of a clinical control serum. These lab projects make use of "real" samples (serum, air, water) and require students to design, optimize, and validate a method(s) to do the work in their project. Two broad pedagogical objectives of this project are- to provide instruction in modern analytical chemistry through changes to the analytical curriculum and the acquisition of modern analytical instrumentation, and to create an educational environment in which students solve problems by learning to think as analytical chemists. These objectives are accomplished by: (1) creating a &lt;br/&gt;new curriculum that better represents the skills required in analytical chemistry; (2) providing students with a problem-based laboratory experience; (3) creating a student-centered lab emphasizing cooperative learning; (4) training students in the use of modern, automated instrumentation; and (5) linking the analytical lab experience to a student's interests. In the Method Development course, an upper-level laboratory course required of chemistry majors, the students work as part of a research team to design, optimize and validate an analytical method for an analyte in a complex, real matrix. Each student assumes responsibility for one or more aspects of the group's project. A key feature of this project is the use of the "jigsaw" concept in which students from different groups, but with similar responsibilities, periodically meet to share information and discuss solutions to common problems.</AbstractNarration>
