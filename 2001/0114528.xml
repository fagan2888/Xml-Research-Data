    <AbstractNarration>0114528&lt;br/&gt;Rao&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Vittal Rao of University of Missouri-Rolla and junior and senior researchers from various U.S. universities to participate in workshops on engineering education. The workshops will be held concomitantly with the International Conference on Engineering Education to be held in Oslo, Norway, August 6-10, 2001. The workshop topics are internet-based course development, exchange programs for students and faculty, multidisciplinary design programs, and industry collaborations and alliances. The selection process for which participants will be supported will be open, and a special effort will be made to include junior faculty members. Special attention will be given to strengthening ties between delegates from the U.S. and those from the various other countries. A primary goal of the workshops is to catalyze the development of action plans for long-term international collaborations and partnerships, and to promote sharing of educational innovations between the schools of different countries.</AbstractNarration>
