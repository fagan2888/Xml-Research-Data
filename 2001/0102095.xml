    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Can Bacteria Move by Slime Extrusion? The physics of A-type motility in Mxyococcus xanthus." Myxococcus xanthus moves by gliding utilizing two distinct genetic mechanisms: Social(S) and Adventurous(A) motility. This is a study of A-type motility using a slime extrusion model based on a nozzle-like organelle discovered in cyanobacteria. A theoretical model is being explored and experiments performed to determine if this type of mechanism can drive A-motility.</AbstractNarration>
