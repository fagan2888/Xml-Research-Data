    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for NSF Proposal DMS - 0102279&lt;br/&gt;The Topology of Open Manifolds with Nonnegative Ricci Curvature&lt;br/&gt;Christina Sormani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sormani proposes to study the topology of complete manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;nonnegative Ricci curvature and their limit spaces. In particular she&lt;br/&gt;plans to investigate various approaches to Milnor's conjecture that&lt;br/&gt;the fundamental group of an open manifold with nonnegative Ricci&lt;br/&gt;curvature is finitely generated. She also plans to study the higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional homology of these spaces. Techniques which will be&lt;br/&gt;employed involve Gromov-Hausdorff limits, the almost rigidity theory&lt;br/&gt;of Cheeger-Colding, and Busemann functions. In particular, the&lt;br/&gt;properness of Busemann functions on these manifolds will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. It should be noted that there are direct applications&lt;br/&gt;of this project to the theory of topological censorship in general&lt;br/&gt;relativity. The condition of nonnegative Ricci curvature on&lt;br/&gt;space-time is called the null energy condition and it arises in the&lt;br/&gt;Einstein equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Roughly speaking, Dr. Sormani proposes to study the existence and&lt;br/&gt;prevalence of holes in a space which has no boundary, extends to&lt;br/&gt;infinity and has a condition imposed upon the way in which it can&lt;br/&gt;bend. The universe we live in is such a space. Simpler examples are&lt;br/&gt;cylinders (i.e. tubes) and paraboloids (i.e. bowls). The cylinder has&lt;br/&gt;a hole but the paraboloid does not. The spaces studied in this&lt;br/&gt;project are of arbitrary dimension and so the holes come in various&lt;br/&gt;dimensions as well. The universe is one such higher dimensional space&lt;br/&gt;and its holes, which may or may not exist, are often called wormholes.&lt;br/&gt;By furthering our understanding of this geometric problem, it is hoped&lt;br/&gt;that we will further our understanding of the universe.</AbstractNarration>
