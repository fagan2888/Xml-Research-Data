    <AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conferences on a number of scientific topics, are held every summer to discuss recent findings and current thinking in various areas of science. Although participation is limited, the attendees usually consist of established scientists, young investigators who are making important contributions in these areas, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. The meetings are usually held in small isolated New England towns away from other distractions, and are conducive to the free exchange of ideas. These conferences have a recognized value for presenting the latest advances in research and also for indicating the future trends in research which are likely to be most productive. This award represents full or partial support of 21 conferences in the biological sciences being held in the summer of 2001 through the spring of 2002.</AbstractNarration>
