    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;Advances in microtechnology have increased the possibility for providing robotics&lt;br/&gt;instruction emphasizing computing requirements rather than hardware requirements.&lt;br/&gt;Curricula for a first course in robotics have been published to take advantage of this&lt;br/&gt;technology. The purpose of this project is to take advantage of the existing work, adapting&lt;br/&gt;it as necessary to produce an effective, hands-on course in robotics within the computer&lt;br/&gt;science curriculum at the University of North Florida. To realize this objective, an&lt;br/&gt;appropriate robotics laboratory is needed and a set of robotics laboratory projects must be&lt;br/&gt;developed.&lt;br/&gt;No general standards have as yet been developed for robotics technology. A major&lt;br/&gt;inhibitor for introducing robotics courses within computer science has been the uniqueness&lt;br/&gt;of the fabrication requirements, which has largely confined the subject to engineering-&lt;br/&gt;related programs with resources for robotics construction needs. Corresponding software&lt;br/&gt;has been in short supply, and generally has relied on base-level programming in C or in&lt;br/&gt;machine language. Existing robotics curricula for computer science that have been&lt;br/&gt;developed have been constrained by the need to develop a lab and produce a viable lab&lt;br/&gt;maintenance plan, all complicated by the fabrication issues. On the other hand, significant&lt;br/&gt;progress has been made in reducing the complexity of electro-mechanical requirements,&lt;br/&gt;allowing software issues for producing effective autonomous robots to receive increased&lt;br/&gt;attention.&lt;br/&gt;Robotics kits developed by the KISS Institute for Practical Robotics (KIPR) and&lt;br/&gt;incorporated into this proposal at least partly redress the logistical issues and form the&lt;br/&gt;basis for a robotics lab suitable for supporting a first course in robotics. To conduct the&lt;br/&gt;course of instruction, an incremental series of hands-on exercises using the laboratory&lt;br/&gt;facility must be developed and tested. The KISS Institute will be called upon to both&lt;br/&gt;evaluate overall project outcomes and to promulgate materials developed for the project&lt;br/&gt;(the Institute is a non-profit national corporation that among its objectives seeks to&lt;br/&gt;advance the state of robotics education).</AbstractNarration>
