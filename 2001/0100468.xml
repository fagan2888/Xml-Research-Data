    <AbstractNarration>Our Intermediate Energy research group at Boston University consists of three&lt;br/&gt;faculty, two postdoctoral fellows, four graduate students, and several&lt;br/&gt;part-time undergraduate students. In the next three years, we will:&lt;br/&gt;1) Continue to work on the Muon g-2 experiment. The muon is like&lt;br/&gt;a heavy electron but is unstable and decays like a radioactive nuclear&lt;br/&gt;isotope. Because it has both spin and charge, it behaves like a microscopic&lt;br/&gt;bar magnet, whose magnetism we measure in our experiment (g-2). Our latest&lt;br/&gt;value, based on a small part of our data, disagrees with the Standard Model&lt;br/&gt;(a theory which describes the particles in nature and the forces between them)&lt;br/&gt;prediction by several times the error. If this disagreement persists after&lt;br/&gt;we analyze all of our data, it will be very exciting since it suggests the&lt;br/&gt;existence of new physics beyond the standard model. We plan two other&lt;br/&gt;experiments using the same large storage ring magnet which is used for&lt;br/&gt;g-2, the measurement of the muon electric dipole moment(EDM) and the&lt;br/&gt;direct measurement of the muon neutrino mass. The EDM is expected in&lt;br/&gt;theory to be smaller than we can measure, while indirect measurements&lt;br/&gt;from other experiments suggest that the neutrino mass is not zero.&lt;br/&gt;2) Measure the muon lifetime, which determines the strength of the&lt;br/&gt;weak interaction within the standard model.&lt;br/&gt;3) Measure the muon to electron conversion rate to unprecedented accuracy,&lt;br/&gt;a process which is forbidden by the Standard Model.&lt;br/&gt;All of these measurements directly test the Standard Model. Any&lt;br/&gt;significant deviation of the experimental values from theory would imply&lt;br/&gt;that there is physics beyond what we already know.</AbstractNarration>
