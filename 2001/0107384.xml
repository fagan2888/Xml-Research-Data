    <AbstractNarration>0107384&lt;br/&gt;Tyler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide twelve months of support to Dr. Gaines Tyler to work with Dr. Thomas H. Cribb at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will determine life-cycles for 9-12 species of tapeworms from elasmobranches (final hosts). DNA sequences from adult specimens will be used to construct a library. Larval stages will be identified by comparing their DNA sequences to sequences in the library. By identifying hosts for both adult and larva, the final stage of the life-cycle will be determined. This project will address the specificity of parasite-host relationships in these cestode species. The life cycles of tapeworms in elasmobranches are poorly known and this project will extend our knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research site, Australia's Great Barrier Reef, hosts one of the greatest diversities of elasmobranches in the world. Dr. Cribb has extensive experience in the resolution of flatworm life-cycles using molecular techniques.</AbstractNarration>
