    <AbstractNarration>0138023&lt;br/&gt;Schroeder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Dr. Paul Schroeder, Department of Geology at the University of Georgia (UGA), Athens, Georgia and Dr. O. Isik Ece of the Geological Sciences Department of Istanbul Technical University (ITU) in Istanbul, Turkey. Tectonic evolution of North Anatolian Fault zone and Neo-Tethys suture belts from Aegean Sea to Western Anatolia and the recent discovery of kaolin deposits within these tectonic belts have become a new focus of earth scientists in assessing resources in the global clay industry and the magnitude of silicate alteration effects on global climate change. The purpose of this joint research is to determine (1) the alteration mechanism of volcanic rocks to kaolin group minerals, and estimate its role in the mass-balance of global element cycles, (2) the distribution of parent, secondary and tertiary minerals in order to estimate the extent of hydrothermal alteration zones, and (3) to verify alteration stages and physico-chemical conditions of volcanic tuffs by geochemical analysis of the waters. The area selected for field research in Turkey has unique features of mineral occurrences and hydrothermal alterations associated with branches of major active North Anatolian Fault system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The field setting is particularly suitable to examine the full range of geochemical and sedimentological conditions leading to the formation of economically viable deposits. Because Turkey is on one of the most active fault zones, it provides an ideal setting to study hydrothermal alteration of primary (and formation of industrial secondary) clay minerals. The project will shed new light on fossil hydrothermal systems and on the occurrence of high quality industrial phyllosilicates from the point of view of physical features and crystal chemistry. There is a possibility for the discovery of halloysite deposits that could serve the ceramic markets. This study could provide mineralogical and geochemical information that can be utilized in understanding the genesis of other kaolinite and halloysite occurrences. Turkish scientists will utilize the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscope and stable isotope facilities at UGA. Geology students from UGA will gain valuable field experience and will benefit from the international collaboration. The project meets INT criteria for support of cooperative projects that are mutually beneficial.</AbstractNarration>
