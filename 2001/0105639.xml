    <AbstractNarration>C-CR 0105639&lt;br/&gt;Dana Randall&lt;br/&gt;"Markov Chain Algorithms for Computational Problems from Physics and Biology"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods has three &lt;br/&gt;primary goals: (i) developing new, general techniques for &lt;br/&gt;analyzing convergence rates of Markov chains; (ii) designing rigorous, &lt;br/&gt;efficient algorithms for specific computational applications, focusing &lt;br/&gt;on problems from statistical physics and biology with relevance &lt;br/&gt;to computer science; and (iii) exploring the connections between &lt;br/&gt;the phase structure of physical models and the inherent limitations &lt;br/&gt;of various sampling methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is concentrated in these areas. 1) Coupling has been &lt;br/&gt;a very popular method for bounding the convergence rates&lt;br/&gt;of Markov chains based on local updates, but only works in &lt;br/&gt;restrictive settings. Heat bath algorithms, which allow possibly &lt;br/&gt;nonlocal updates, appear to circumvent potentially bad situations &lt;br/&gt;arising from simpler chains, but tend to be prohibitively complex &lt;br/&gt;for analysis. Decomposition theorems provide a new tool which &lt;br/&gt;allow a Markov chain to be broken into pieces whereby a hybrid &lt;br/&gt;approach can be used to analyze each piece. The investigator &lt;br/&gt;studies how these methods can be used together to approach some &lt;br/&gt;new sampling problems. 2) Computational biologists have developed &lt;br/&gt;a Turing-universal model of computation based on Wang tiles using &lt;br/&gt;double-stranded DNA. New efficient sampling algorithms for some&lt;br/&gt;of these simple models are explored with the goal of providing ways&lt;br/&gt;to test the model predict outcomes of experiments.&lt;br/&gt;3) The research additionally explores the connection between &lt;br/&gt;rapid mixing of locally defined Markov chains and the uniqueness &lt;br/&gt;of the Gibbs state of the underlying physical system, also &lt;br/&gt;characterized by the lack of a phase transition. Knowledge of &lt;br/&gt;this phase structure is used to develop algorithms which will allow &lt;br/&gt;sampling below the critical point, where local Markov chains &lt;br/&gt;are inefficient.</AbstractNarration>
