    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0107792&lt;br/&gt;Zoltan Szabo&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of this project is the study of three-manifolds &lt;br/&gt;and smooth four-manifolds by using gauge theory and symplectic geometry. The Principal Investigator proposes to study and &lt;br/&gt;further develop a recent construction that give invariants &lt;br/&gt;for closed oriented 3-manifolds and a related construction &lt;br/&gt;that give invariants for smooth closed oriented 4-manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;These constructions use handle decompositions and a version&lt;br/&gt;of Lagrangian Floer-homology. The PI will also study &lt;br/&gt;applications of these new techniques in 3 and 4-manifold &lt;br/&gt;topology. In particular PI will study these invariants for three-manifolds that fiber over a circle and symplectic &lt;br/&gt;4-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gauge theory is a very important technique in smooth &lt;br/&gt;4-manifold theory. It involves the theory of Donaldson &lt;br/&gt;invariants and Seiberg-Witten invariants. These invariants &lt;br/&gt;are constructed by solving certain elliptic partial differential equations inspired by mathematical physics. Both constructions &lt;br/&gt;have ramifications for three-manifolds as well, these&lt;br/&gt;are related to solving the partial differential equations &lt;br/&gt;over four-manifolds with a three-dimensional boundary. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to studying these invariants the Principal &lt;br/&gt;Investigator also proposes to study in detail a third &lt;br/&gt;construction that involves holomorphic disks and a &lt;br/&gt;decomposition of the manifold into elementary pieces.</AbstractNarration>
