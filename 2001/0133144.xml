    <AbstractNarration>This project focuses on studying general purpose visual tracking systems. A model-based approach will be used, emphasizing the particular class of objects to be tracked. The tracking procedure is to be based on solving partial differential equations describing curve flow. Schemes for performing tracking will be developed based on intensity information, which is contained within the region of the curve in question. Faster, more effective, and more robust trackers will be generated by extending the general framework via generalization of the assumptions used, and through formal analysis of the related PDEs. Also addressed will be the more general problem of combining shape and intensity-based information; as above, the algorithm will also look for intensity patterns that match what it knows about the class of objects to be tracked. The education part of the project includes curriculum development, undergraduate independent studies, and exposure of a large number students to an experimental system designed by the PI.</AbstractNarration>
