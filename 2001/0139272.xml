    <AbstractNarration>The project will provide science teachers in the middle schools in the Springfield, Massachusetts school district with opportunities to acquire science content knowledge and training in inquiry and project-based teaching, including the opportunity to conduct research as a part of a team with GK-12 Fellows, and UMass faculty. The Fellows and faculty will gain an understanding of the needs and culture of the schools, laying the foundations for future collaborations. The project will provide Fellows with increased experience in effective pedagogical approaches, and will also provide a diverse population of middle school students with role models and mentors. Middle school teachers in a master's degree program will work in teams (six in all) consisting of a UMass faculty participant, two GK-12 Fellows, and up to three middle school teachers) on the implementation of research projects with theirs school students. STEM Connections will start with summer workshops for the Fellows and teachers. Teams will then work together for two semesters in a course focused on teacher learning of project-based instruction while concomitantly developing similar projects with middle school students. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
