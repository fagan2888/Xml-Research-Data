    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will investigate problems &lt;br/&gt;involving the representation theory of reductive algebraic &lt;br/&gt;groups. The structures related to reductive groups include &lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras, Chevalley groups, Weyl groups and centralizer &lt;br/&gt;algebras. The methods and constructions involved in the study will be &lt;br/&gt;algebraic as well as geometric. The underlying theme will be &lt;br/&gt;to establish connections between the cohomology and representations &lt;br/&gt;of the objects in order to prove new and interesting results &lt;br/&gt;about these structures. Establishing such relationships also &lt;br/&gt;lends itself to providing concrete calculations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algebraic objects known as "groups," "rings" and "Lie algebras" &lt;br/&gt;arise in many different physical applications in biology, &lt;br/&gt;chemistry and physics. These algebraic objects &lt;br/&gt;in general have complex internal structures and symmetries. &lt;br/&gt;Extracting information about these structures can provide &lt;br/&gt;vital information which can be used in a range of applications&lt;br/&gt;such as those mentioned above. This project is in the area&lt;br/&gt;of representation theory, which is now a central area of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics because it provides a systematic method for studying &lt;br/&gt;complicated algebraic structures. Roughly speaking, representations &lt;br/&gt;can be thought of as ``snapshots'' of some algebraic object from&lt;br/&gt;different viewing angles. These snapshots are provided via &lt;br/&gt;explicitly described matrices. By putting together &lt;br/&gt;the information from the representations, many questions &lt;br/&gt;surrounding these complicated algebraic systems can be answered.</AbstractNarration>
