    <AbstractNarration>In this project the PIs will carry out a program of research and development to apply digital imaging techniques to the problem of low vision. The work will focus on two related thrusts. First, low vision simulation methods will be developed that accurately show people with normal vision what the world looks like to people with visual deficits. The goal is to develop simulation tools that designers can use to understand the visual limitations (and abilities) of people with low vision and thereby eliminate barriers to access from their designs. Applications in the areas of architectural design, driving safety, and the development of graphical user interfaces will be demonstrated. Second, the PIs will develop low vision image enhancement tools that can be used to transform images from digital cameras or graphics applications to create new images that are more comprehensible to people with low vision. The objective is to use computational models of low vision to develop image enhancement algorithms that can be incorporated into digital imaging systems to give people with low vision better access to the visual world. The PIs plan to use these algorithms to develop two new kinds of assistive technology: image profiling and enhancement tools for Web browsers to enable low vision access to Web-based graphical information; and portable augmented vision systems that can facilitate orientation, mobility and object recognition for people with low vision. The hope is that the methods developed will provide better understanding of the challenges facing people with low vision, and lead to effective assistive technologies that can help people with low vision live easier, fuller and more productive lives.</AbstractNarration>
