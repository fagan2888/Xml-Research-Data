    <AbstractNarration>The Nebraska REU is an eight-week summer program for 10 undergraduate students, most of whom will be from other institutions. The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln is a Ph.D. granting research department that is regionally and nationally recognized for excellence in teaching. The Nebraska REU draws on these qualities to cultivate an environment that emphasizes interaction among its students and among its students and the Department as the students develop their research&lt;br/&gt;skills. In addition to research, there is an emphasis on developing written and oral communication skills in mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Nebraska REU offers the opportunity for mathematically talented students to carry out research in areas of applied mathematics, each under the guidance of a team of applied mathematicians. It is anticipated that two to four students will work under an advisor team on closely related problems with daily seminars for the first few weeks to get the research off to a good start. There will be weekly lectures on topics of a general&lt;br/&gt;mathematical interest given by faculty, students, and visitors. Social activities are planned throughout the eight weeks with a greater frequency during the first week. On-campus room, board, and the student recreation center are provided. The Department will also provide students up to $400 toward the cost associated to presenting their REU work at a conference.</AbstractNarration>
