    <AbstractNarration>This project is a collaboration between Kingsborough Community College and Brooklyn College to strengthen the science skills of future K-12 teachers. An integrated three-course sequence at Kingsborough Community College features an education course with a fieldwork component, an independent study course, and a revised Biology course. These courses are engaging preservice teachers in inquiry-based science projects with a constructivist approach. The students participate in field work at informal science institutions and serve as docents working with children under the supervision of a science educator. Kingsborough Community College and Brooklyn College faculty are collaborating in the development of web-enhanced courses and virtual components of science and education courses. An on-line advisement system for transfer students is specifically designed to facilitate the transition of prospective teachers into the teacher preparation program Brooklyn College. The project includes early mentoring by peer tutors and K-12 teachers. The overall goal of "Crossing Boundaries" is to expand the pool of qualified teachers and to better prepare these teachers to introduce their own students to science and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
