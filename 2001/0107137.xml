    <AbstractNarration>Gurnis &lt;br/&gt;0107137 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose to develop dynamic models of the interaction of plate tectonics with mantle convection and continental deformation. They will continue with modeling studies in which mantle dynamics is placed within an explicit plate tectonics framework, such that models are tested with observations in both the time domain (for example geological constraints on surface uplift) and present day geophysical observations (such as seismic tomography). They will explicitly focus on three problems which are well posed within a plate tectonics framework: 1.) The large-scale flow since the Early Cretaceous associated with the breakup of Gondwanaland; 2.) The time-dependent evolution of the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone since its inception during the Eocene; 3.) The deformation of western North American lithosphere and upper mantle since the Middle Miocene. In all cases, they will use a common methodology in which the convection equations are solved within a spherical domain using a finite element code capable handling problems with very large variations in viscosity. They will solve large, well-resolved problems using the parallelized software on an in-house 312 processor Beowulf computer.</AbstractNarration>
