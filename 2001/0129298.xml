    <AbstractNarration>The PIs request LTREB support to continue experimental studies in the Chihuahuan Desert&lt;br/&gt;near Portal, Arizona. The 20-ha study site contains 24 fenced plots, each 0.25 ha in&lt;br/&gt;area. They have maintained the removal of some or all species of rodents and/or ants from&lt;br/&gt;10 plots continuously since 1977 and from an additional 4 plots since 1988. Standardized&lt;br/&gt;censuses of rodents, ants, and plants provide invaluable data on responses of individuals,&lt;br/&gt;populations, and communities both to experimental perturbations and to background temporal&lt;br/&gt;and spatial variation in the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results to date demonstrate: 1) complex interannual and seasonal dynamics of rodent, ant,&lt;br/&gt;and plant populations; 2) direct effects of seed predation by rodents, birds, and ants on&lt;br/&gt;winter annual plants; 3) direct effects of competition by kangaroo rats on population&lt;br/&gt;densities and species diversity of other seed-eating rodent species; 4) indirect effects&lt;br/&gt;of kangaroo rats on vegetation, other rodents, birds, and lizards; 5) reorganization of&lt;br/&gt;the entire ecosystem, including large increases in woody vegetation and extinctions,&lt;br/&gt;colonizations, or shifts in abundance of many animal species, apparently caused by a&lt;br/&gt;change in climate since the late 1970's; 6) regulation of emergent properties, such as&lt;br/&gt;species diversity, biomass, and energy use of rodents and plants, within narrow bounds&lt;br/&gt;despite large shifts in species composition in response to environmental change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research for the next five years includes: 1) continuation of experimental&lt;br/&gt;manipulations and standardized censuses of rodents, ants, and plants; 2) focus on spatial&lt;br/&gt;patterns and processes over a wide range of scales; 3) investigation of the experimental&lt;br/&gt;manipulations and functional groups of organisms on ecosystem processes; 4) examination of&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of the ant community; and 5) assessment of the interacting influences of&lt;br/&gt;climate, livestock grazing, and fire on the transition between desert shrubland and arid&lt;br/&gt;grassland.</AbstractNarration>
