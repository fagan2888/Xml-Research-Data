    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to Boston University will enable constructing the first of its kind instrumentation for insitu and real-time characterization and control of coating microstructure. A deeper understanding crack formation mechanisms will enable custom tailoring of coating structure for different applications through use of the advanced closed loop control system. Plasma spray is a widely used deposition process since it can be economically used to engineer coating attributes. As such, it is an enabling technology in many applications in aerospace, engines, power systems, electronics, and biomedical applications. This custom designed system includes sensors for measuring the particle state, the thermal distribution and roughness characteristics of the deposit surface, as well as the actuators needed to implement real-time control of the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program supports instrument development at Boston University. The instrument will enable a better understanding of microstructural development and crack formation in plasma sprayed coatings, as well as design of an advanced process control system that is expected to enable manufacture of new coating structures. The interdisciplinary research team includes researchers in materials, heat transfer, mechanics, and control. Broad educational impact is planned, including the direct research experience of undergraduate and graduate students, and by incorporation of the equipment and results obtained into the course work of not only materials courses but the related process control, heat transfer, and experimental courses offered by the College.</AbstractNarration>
