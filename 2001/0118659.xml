    <AbstractNarration>0118659&lt;br/&gt;Rebhun&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program thesis enhancement will support thesis dissertation research by &lt;br/&gt;Ms. Yasmina Katsulis under the supervision of Dr. Linda-Anne Rebhun of Yale University. Dr. Gudelia Rangel of El Colegio de la Frontera Norte has agreed to act as field supervisor for the fieldwork in Mexico. The aim of this project is to examine career trajectories among 300 female commercial sex workers (FCSW's) in Tijuana, Mexico, and more specifically, the relationship between migration patterns, work sites and HIV risk. In particular, the project will: (1) examine the relationship between migration and the various career trajectories of 300 FCSW's in Tijuana, Mexico; (2) measure their knowledge, attitudes, and practices for risk management in a variety of work sites; (3) examine how risk management is either complicated or facilitated by structural factors, most importantly female urban migration; (4) generate an epidemiological profile of HIV infection for the population in question.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using integrated qualitative and quantitative methods, this research will help to provide a more comprehensive portrait of those aspects of human experience critical in determining health outcomes. The findings will contribute to the literature on health beliefs in Latin America, the political economy of health, and the use of qualitative methods to address public health issues.</AbstractNarration>
