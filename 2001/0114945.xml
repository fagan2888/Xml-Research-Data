    <AbstractNarration>This project over a year period, will examine gender differences in the ways strategy use, speed of retrieval, spatial skills, confidence in mathematics, and conceptual understanding predict mathematics achievement. The longitudinal study beginning in the second grade and ending in the fourth grade, will document whether gender difference found in early strategy use, spatial skills and confidence continue through three years of elementary school and whether they promote each other's development and mathematics achievement. The elementary school years have been selected for study because although gender differences in strategy use, spatial skills, and confidence have been documented in elementary school age children, it is not clear how these differences may impact mathematics achievement. If mathematics achievement and conceptual understanding are affected by these early emerging gender differences that would suggest a need to intervene in girls' mathematics in the early elementary school years as opposed to waiting until the middle school and high school years when gender differences become more pronounced.This project over a year period, will examine gender differences in the ways strategy use, speed of retrieval, spatial skills, confidence in mathematics, and conceptual understanding predict mathematics achievement.
