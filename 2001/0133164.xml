    <AbstractNarration>The objective of the research component of this work is the preparation of a number of C2-symmetric aromatic heterocycles and porphyrins and the assembly of these components into oligocatenanes (molecular chains) and other types of interwoven oligomers. The monomers used for chain assembly are predominantly bis-(pyridyl)pyridines, bis-(benzimidazolyl)pyridines and bis-(benzimidazolyl)propane units. These ligands contain benzyl halide or benzaldehyde functional groups which allow for future chain growth. After the ligands are synthesized, two are complexed to Zn(II) or Cu(I) to provide a "kink" in the molecular chain and then chain growth is initiated off the functional groups in the ligands. A variety of catenates and hetero-metallic oligocatenates will be prepared using this approach. Column oligomers and two dimensional grids and networks will also be prepared using a similar strategy but starting with formyl functionalized porphyrin monomers. There are two major educational components to this project. In educational outreach, this group is working with the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and the Great Lakes Science Center to establish Polymer Science Days and Polymer Funhouse exhibits. An additional educational component of this work is the development of two polymer chemistry lecture courses at CWRU, one aimed primarily at undergraduate chemistry, engineering and materials science majors and a second aimed primarily at graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational goals of Dr. Stuart J. Rowan of the Department of Chemistry at Case Western Reserve University. Dr. Rowan will explore the synthesis of heterocyclic monomers which can be assembled into molecular chains and interwoven grids and networks. Such materials may have practical applications in the development of high temperature polymers, sensors, and separation membranes as well as exhibiting conducting and light harvesting properties which may prove useful in display devices. Students trained as a result of working on this project will gain experience in materials research as well as supramolecular organic and inorganic chemistry, hence they will have skills needed by both the specialty chemicals and the computer/materials industries.
