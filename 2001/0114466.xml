    <AbstractNarration>0114466&lt;br/&gt;Crisalle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will support Dr. Oscar D. Crisalle of the University of Florida in collaboration with Dr. Jose M. Pinto of the University of Sao Paulo, for the organization of the 2nd Pan American Workshop on Process Systems Engineering to be held in Guaruja, Sao Paulo, Brazil on September 20-21, 2001. This project will focus on two specific areas of process systems engineering: (1) Process Control and (2) Process Planning and Optimization. The major goal of the workshop is to identify common research priorities, and to explore possible areas of joint research cooperation in process engineering research that can lead to significant scientific and economic benefits for the participating countries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several benefits will be derived from this workshop, including (1) the development of new collaborations in the area of process control, (2) expanding the number of collaborations in the area of process planning and optimization beyond that achieved through a previous workshop, (3) increasing the number of exchanges of students and faculty between the US and South America, and (4) the publication of several articles in a special issue of computers in Chemical Engineering dedicated to covering the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
