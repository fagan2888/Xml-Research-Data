    <AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES 0135622&lt;br/&gt;Public Science: Discourse on the Strategic Defense Initiative, 1983-1988&lt;br/&gt;Gusterson/Slayton&lt;br/&gt;MIT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scientists hold a paradoxical place in American society today, for while their knowledge&lt;br/&gt;is woven into the fabric of everyday human life, scientists themselves are often imagined to dwell above the plane of everyday human concerns. This postdoctoral project explores this paradox -- both its roots and its implications for science policy and communications -- by examining dialogue on the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the mid-1980's. Three immediate objectives lie in examinations of three interacting communities: scientists in the political sphere, journalists and others presenting the debate, and a pluralistic public. Findings from this research are to be communicated in academic journals, in conference papers, and in ongoing dialogue with local scholars. Longer-range goals tie this research to the retraining of Rebecca Slayton in historical and sociological studies of science and technology. Slayton builds on doctoral training in physical chemistry at Harvard, working under the sponsorship of PI Hugh Gusterson and co-PI David Kaiser, both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together historical studies of scientists in the political sphere and&lt;br/&gt;studies of public communication of science. In debate over SDI, the same scientists acted as advisors and political activists, straining a long-standing tension between fears of technical tyranny and the need for technical expertise. Slayton examines the political roles that scientists assumed in debate surrounding SDI from a historical perspective, contributing to an understanding of the shifting role of the scientist in society. Because this role has been reflected in popular depictions of scientists, this project also examines public images of scientists and technology, as portrayed in magazines, newspapers, and on television. By comparing portrayals within and among these media, this work emphasizes how the constraints of particular media shape presentations of science and technology. Finally, this project examines discourse about scientists and SDI among several communities, analyzing the role particular communal values played in understanding science communication as an interactive process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Slayton's retraining involves coursework in sociological and historical approaches to science will build relevant methodological skills; courses in media studies; and teaching an undergraduate seminar course with the hope of stimulating dialogue about popular voices of science and their implications for the social roles of scientists. Her research plan includes interviewing scientists and analyzing their technical assessments and political statements; gathering and analyzing public presentations of scientific aspects of SDI in newspapers, magazines, and on television; examining public discourse in letters to editors in a variety of newspapers and among several smaller communities with common concerns. Ultimately, this project result in a better understanding of dialogue between scientists and publics, a dialogue that is central to today's science policy and culture.</AbstractNarration>
