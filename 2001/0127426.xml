    <AbstractNarration>Faculty members attempting to create materials for collections of engineering education&lt;br/&gt;content in a digital library face several challenges. Lack of training in sound pedagogical&lt;br/&gt;practices, a shortage of training in the effective use of educational technology, short&lt;br/&gt;supply of required resources and time to produce completed and tested works, and a lack&lt;br/&gt;of emphasis on improved teaching in the university faculty rewards systems are the major&lt;br/&gt;obstacles to materials development. To remedy this situation, this project endeavors to&lt;br/&gt;create an active, engaged, and sustained virtual community of engineering educators who&lt;br/&gt;energetically contribute to and share materials from a common collection of courseware.&lt;br/&gt;The virtual community is taking form as an incubator in which faculty are trained in&lt;br/&gt;sound pedagogical practices e.g., developing learning goals and assessment techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Next, participants are schooled in the effective use of technology in many different&lt;br/&gt;teaching/learning situations including: classroom presentation, self-study, distance and&lt;br/&gt;distributed learning, experiential learning, etc. Once trained, faculty then develop a&lt;br/&gt;portion of a collection of courseware modules in their area of expertise. Guidelines are &lt;br/&gt;provided so that modules can be integrated with each other from both the standpoint&lt;br/&gt;of technology mix as well as the pedagogical approach being used. Members of the virtual&lt;br/&gt;community of contributors subsequently become the testers of the courseware modules,&lt;br/&gt;with each of the contributors using a subset of modules to conduct courses at their&lt;br/&gt;home campuses. As soon as a baseline collection in a topic area is established the project &lt;br/&gt;personnel will present national workshops on how to adopt and adapt the materials in the collection.&lt;br/&gt;NEEDS will be used to catalog and make the collections available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Keywords: Virtual community, NEEDS, digital library</AbstractNarration>
