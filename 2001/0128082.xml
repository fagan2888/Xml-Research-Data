    <AbstractNarration>The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the synthesis of new polysiloxane-polyimide co-polymers for use as high-temperature resistant polymeric matrix materials. Phase I will develop new highly usable synthetic methodologies for the production of inorganic-organic hybrid materials composed of cross-linked polysiloxane-polyimide segments. The cross-linking or curing (hydrosilylation) reaction may be conducted at room temperature, thus providing the opportunity to develop a non-autoclave or low-temperature curing system, similar to the well-established room temperature vulcanization process widely used in the silicone industry. The expected high-performance polymeric materials would be employed in Phase II as matrix materials for low-temperature fabrication of polymeric matrix composites (PMC). In Phase II polymer formulation will be optimized, and distinctive PMC components will be fabricated by employing proprietary low-cost resin transfer molding technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commercial applications are expected in low-temperature curable/high-temperature resistant cure-in-place materials. Potential fields of application include automotive components, aeronautics, microelectronics, composites, construction materials, and other industries where outstanding thermal, chemical (solvents and oxidation resistance), physical, and mechanical properties are important.</AbstractNarration>
