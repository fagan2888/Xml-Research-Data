    <AbstractNarration>0123224&lt;br/&gt;Kohlstedt&lt;br/&gt;This award supports David Kohlstedt and students from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in a collaboration with Stephen Mackwell of the Bayerisches Geoinstitut at the University of Bayreuth, Germany. The project will focus on the evolution of melt topology during deformation of partially molten mantle rocks. The research is motivated by the observation that a small amount of melt has a large effect on the physical properties of a partially molten rock. The connectivity and geometry of the melt network control permeability, rheology, electrical conductivity, seismic velocities, and seismic attenuation. A new torsion apparatus in the German lab provides the best test bed to investigate the evolution of melt topology; quantification of the dependence of melt distribution on stress state for developing models of melt redistribution is best accomplished by direct comparison of results of experiments performed in each lab separately. The work plan provides for extensive participation by graduate students in the international travel and research.</AbstractNarration>
