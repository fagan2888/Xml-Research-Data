    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61) This project is a collaborative effort of biology and chemistry faculty to develop curricula in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. Objectives are to: 1) enhance the complementary nature of these two programs via team teaching and the utilization of state-of-the-art equipment for DNA and protein analysis, thereby effecting reform and refinement of courses throughout the four years of the programs; 2) integrate problem solving investigative approaches to learning in a developmental fashion throughout the four years, and in so doing encourage student research; 3) bring curricula into the 21st century of genomics and proteomics. To accomplish these goals the project is adapting successful approaches of several NSF funded projects. The activities in this proposal include development of new courses including an integrated Molecular Biology and Biochemistry senior seminar, implementation of new inquiry based laboratory experiences in a variety of courses across the curricula, team teaching, enhanced coordination of the two programs, acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment for teaching and research. A major focus is to promote undergraduate research in these areas, encouraging students to participate in interdisciplinary projects that involve faculty from chemistry and life sciences. Workshops to disseminate the results of the project include one for a general audience of high school teachers and college faculty, and one for a specialized audience of science students and faculty. The expected outcomes include complementary state-of-the-art curricula that encourages and enables excellence in student research in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and fosters the development of students who will go on to graduate work and employment in the burgeoning fields of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry.</AbstractNarration>
