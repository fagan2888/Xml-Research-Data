    <AbstractNarration>The movement of population from rural towns to large centers remains one of &lt;br/&gt;the most common but striking trends in human settlement. Researchers have &lt;br/&gt;had little trouble in formulating explanations for this population &lt;br/&gt;nucleation in market societies. However, these market-based approaches &lt;br/&gt;have proven of little utility in societies - - or segments of societies - - &lt;br/&gt;not dominated by market institutions. Because these societies were &lt;br/&gt;generally non-literate and left no written records, archaeology provides &lt;br/&gt;the only means to study long-term demographic change in such societies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Viviana Siveroni will investigate chronological settlement trends in a &lt;br/&gt;non-market population of the prehispanic Andes in the Nasca Valley, Peru. &lt;br/&gt;Recent archaeological research has revealed massive regional changes &lt;br/&gt;between AD 550 and AD 950, including: (a) the abandonment of many rural &lt;br/&gt;homesteads and settlements as people flocked to large centers; (b) the end &lt;br/&gt;of a long-standing ideology and ceremonial practice (including that &lt;br/&gt;associated with the famous Nasca "lines"); and (c) an increase in social &lt;br/&gt;stratification even as political decentralization grew. Nothing is known &lt;br/&gt;of the changes at the household or community levels that accompanied these &lt;br/&gt;broad regional changes. Siveroni will investigate potential changes by &lt;br/&gt;excavating and comparing residential areas from a rural village (Las &lt;br/&gt;Carretas) dating to early in this period to those at a center dating to &lt;br/&gt;late in the period (Huayuri). Her work will explore community religious &lt;br/&gt;practices, social structure, and political organization, while focusing on &lt;br/&gt;potential shifts in economic activities. One critical goal of the research &lt;br/&gt;is to explore the relationship dynamics between population nucleation and &lt;br/&gt;reorganization of the household economy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this project is that Siveroni will assess several &lt;br/&gt;theoretical models in which household and communal level processes are &lt;br/&gt;themselves the cause of regional population nucleation. This research thus &lt;br/&gt;represents an attempt to link levels of analysis in a new way. Processes &lt;br/&gt;such as population nucleation must be observed and studied at the regional &lt;br/&gt;level, but their causes may reside at the sub-regional level, even the &lt;br/&gt;level of the household or individual actor. Documenting human motivations &lt;br/&gt;and social processes in a world not governed by rational market forces is &lt;br/&gt;an important contribution of this kind of explanatory archaeology; placing &lt;br/&gt;this work squarely in current debates in locational geography and political &lt;br/&gt;science.</AbstractNarration>
