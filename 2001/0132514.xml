    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0132514&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past the investigator developed techniques to study&lt;br/&gt;Gromov hyperbolic groups. There are several applications of those&lt;br/&gt;techniques in topology, geometry, algebra, analysis. In particular,&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic groups were characterized by bounded cohomology, extending&lt;br/&gt;results my M. Gromov. This characterization was used by A. Connes and&lt;br/&gt;H. Moscovici for a proof of the Novikov conjecture for hyperbolic groups.&lt;br/&gt;S. Gersten provided several descriptions of hyperbolicity in terms of&lt;br/&gt;various (co)homology theories, and later the investigator made&lt;br/&gt;contributions in that direction. Recently, Guoliang Yu and&lt;br/&gt;the investigator were able to prove the Baum-Connes conjecture&lt;br/&gt;for hyperbolic groups and their subgroups. The techniques will be further&lt;br/&gt;developed to address these and other directions. For example,&lt;br/&gt;(co)homological descriptions of relative hyperbolicity will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;As another application, the conformal and other geometric structures&lt;br/&gt;on hyperbolic groups will be constructed. It is the investigator's&lt;br/&gt;hope that this will lead, in particular, to a better understanding&lt;br/&gt;of open conjectures in 3-dimensional topology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is an important and interesting task to investigate shapes&lt;br/&gt;of spaces, in particular of the one in which we live. Geometry studies&lt;br/&gt;spaces of various shapes. Group theory studies groups, that is,&lt;br/&gt;sets of symmetries of spaces. Geometric group theory provides&lt;br/&gt;links between spaces and groups. Every group has an orbit (!) in some &lt;br/&gt;space (!). The orbit is only a part of the space, but once something&lt;br/&gt;is known about the the group, geometric group theory provides information&lt;br/&gt;not only about the orbit, but about the whole space as well. Tools from&lt;br/&gt;several areas of mathematics are used for that. The research part of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal is to develop and use those tools. Another part of the proposal&lt;br/&gt;is organizing and supporting the G^3 = "Geometric group theory on the gulf&lt;br/&gt;coast conference" that would allow exchange of ideas among mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;of various research interests.</AbstractNarration>
