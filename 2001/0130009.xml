    <AbstractNarration>This project provides for development of a long-term research plan that will identify the needs and opportunities that exist to advance the state of the art and the state of the practice in earthquake engineering and earthquake loss reduction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) will convene intensive panel activities to be comprehensive in nature and to advance knowledge in the following areas: improve understanding of physical models, improve the treatment of uncertainty in analysis and simulations, contribute to the development of a protocol for systematic performance data, improve understanding of societal impacts, and contribute to better integration of research and education. The plan will incorporate opportunities presented by high performance computing, information systems, simulation and visualization and will work closely with other organizations and programs including the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS), the NSF-funded earthquake engineering research centers (EERCs), and the agencies and organizations that make up the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EERI will establish a panel of researchers and professionals from the earth sciences, structural and geotechnical engineering, the social and policy sciences, architecture and urban planning, and information technology. Over a nine-month period, the panel members will commission a series of white papers that provide a summary of expert assessment of research needs in each field. The panel will engage in teleconferences to gain further input and will draw on the white papers to prepare the comprehensive plan.</AbstractNarration>
