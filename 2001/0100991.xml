    <AbstractNarration>This award supports a project of Professor Shokurov. The project&lt;br/&gt;is focused on the finite generatedness of algebras--&lt;br/&gt;a fundamental problem of algebra. The work proposed is &lt;br/&gt;to resolve the problem in a certain important class of&lt;br/&gt;algebras (named (FGA)) with the aim to finish the proof &lt;br/&gt;of the existence of log flips in any dimension &lt;br/&gt;whenever the Log Minimal Model Program (LMMP) &lt;br/&gt;and, in particular, the log terminations hold in &lt;br/&gt;the lower dimensions. To apply this inductive step &lt;br/&gt;to the LMMP in dimensions higher than 4&lt;br/&gt;the principal investigator intends to finish the log termination &lt;br/&gt;for 4-folds. This gives the 5-fold log flips, and establishes &lt;br/&gt;the LMMP in dimension 4. A concrete application of this technique&lt;br/&gt;will be done by his student, Jihun Park, in his study of birational &lt;br/&gt;geometry of Del Pezzo fibre spaces, with a view to their existence, &lt;br/&gt;uniqueness of their certain models, and to the birational classification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is research in the field of algebra with methods and applications &lt;br/&gt;in algebraic geometry. The finite generatedness corresponds to&lt;br/&gt;completeness in geometry, and effectiveness from the computational point &lt;br/&gt;of view. Algebra and algebraic geometry are very old, traditional areas of &lt;br/&gt;modern mathematics, but which have had a revolutionary flowering in &lt;br/&gt;the past century. In its origin, algebraic geometry&lt;br/&gt;treated figures that could be defined in the plane by the simplest&lt;br/&gt;equations, namely polynomials, or be given in the 3-space by the simplest&lt;br/&gt;geometric constructions, e. g., conic sections.&lt;br/&gt;Algebra is about these equations. Both fields interacts with most of &lt;br/&gt;branches of mathematics, e.g., analysis, topology and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics, with applications in those&lt;br/&gt;fields as well as in number theory, physics, theoretical computer science,&lt;br/&gt;and robotics.</AbstractNarration>
