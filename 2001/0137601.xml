    <AbstractNarration>0137601&lt;br/&gt;Murray&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project supports a cooperative research project by teams of scientists and graduate students headed by Dr. James Murray, School of Oceanography, University of Washington (UW), Seattle, Washington, Dr. Ilkay Salihoglu, Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS), Middle East Technical University, Erdemli-Icel, Turkey, and Dr. Sergey Konovalov, Marine Hydrophysical Institute (MHI), Ukraine National Academy of Sciences, Sevastopol, Ukraine. This two-year project will take advantage of new samples collected during the 2001 R/V Knorr research cruise in the Black Sea. The research is divided into three projects: 1. Spatial variability in the chemistry of oxygen, sulfide and nutrients in the upper layer of the anoxic zone in the Black Sea due to ventilation from the Bosphorus Inflow conducted by Dr. Murray and a UW graduate student, a Turkish scientist from IMS, and a Ukrainian scientist from MHI. 2. Geochemistry of redox metals (including Mn, Fe, Cd, Mo, U, V, and Re) in particulate matter across the oxic/suboxic/anoxic layers in the water column of the Black Sea, conducted by Dr. Murray, a Turkish scientist, and a Turkish graduate student from IMS. 3. Application of molecular genetic techniques for understanding population genetic structure of Calanus sp. conducted by two junior scientists from UW and a scientist and graduate student from IMS. Two Turkish scientists and two Turkish graduate students will visit UW between January and April 2002. Two US junior scientists from UW will visit IMS in Turkey in June-July 2002. The Ukrainian scientist will travel to the US in winter 2003. Murray and his graduate student will travel to Turkey and Ukraine in April-May 2003, and a Turkish scientist will visit the US in August 2003.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project complements research dealing with the Black Sea being carried out by the US PI under separate funding from the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences. This project will provide graduate students and scientists from Turkey a chance to use state of the art analytical techniques available in the US, but not in Turkey. The collaboration will offer opportunities for two US junior scientists and one female US graduate student to participate in this international project. It will allow scientists from all three countries to develop future international collaborations. The project meets INT objectives of supporting projects of mutual benefit. Funding is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Ocean Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
