    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0131927&lt;br/&gt;Stevenson, Robert&lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts - Boston&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BDEI: Planning a Community Science Approach to Biodiversity Monitoring: Extending the Spatial and Temporal Scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing the spatial scales and temporal frequencies at which species occurrences and locations are&lt;br/&gt;recorded is central to biodiversity informatics. There are not nearly enough trained scientists to do the&lt;br/&gt;job and remote sensing methods have severe limitations for most taxa. This project examines the idea&lt;br/&gt;that it is now possible to rapidly build communities of people (academic taxonomists, amateur natural&lt;br/&gt;historians, environmental educators, concerned citizens and students) and institutions (universities,&lt;br/&gt;environmental NGOs, governmental agencies and schools) to produce important scientific data about&lt;br/&gt;biodiversity. Building monitoring communities is made possible by digital technologies that permit three&lt;br/&gt;key advances:&lt;br/&gt;1) Rapid Color Guides, the production on demand of high quality yet relatively inexpensive mini color&lt;br/&gt;field guides (here called Rapid Color Guides, Foster 1998) that will allow amateurs to correctly identify&lt;br/&gt;many more species in the field.&lt;br/&gt;2) Spatial Coordinates, the ability to accurately record (within a 3 m radius under the best conditions) the&lt;br/&gt;spatial coordinates of individuals or populations using new GPS (Global Positioning System) units.&lt;br/&gt;3) E-Vouchers, the availability of very high quality digital cameras that are field portable and relatively&lt;br/&gt;easy to use that can capture an electronic record of observations in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Along with the wide acceptance of the WWW, these advances permit people to gather and share&lt;br/&gt;biodiversity information in unprecedented ways. Three studies are planned and prototyped to examine&lt;br/&gt;this general claim. First, the variety of taxa recorded during Massachusetts Biodiversity Days, a three-&lt;br/&gt;day statewide citizen-based effort to monitor biodiversity already established in Massachusetts&lt;br/&gt;(http://data.massgis.state.ma.us/Biodiversity/BiodiversityDays.htm) will be expanded. Taxonomic&lt;br/&gt;specialists using digital cameras and printers will design Rapid Color Guides for taxa, which are common&lt;br/&gt;(e.g. ants, bumblebees, spiders, weeds) but rarely recorded by observers because of the lack of a suitable&lt;br/&gt;method to identify them.</AbstractNarration>
