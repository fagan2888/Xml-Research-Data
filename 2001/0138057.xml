    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0138057&lt;br/&gt;S. Lin, Clarkson University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to carry out a combined experimental and analytical investigation on the suppression or enhancement of wave motion in film flows. There are five objectives of this research, three are in the experimental part, and two in the analytical part. The experimental objectives are (1) to see if suppression of onset of instability as predicted theoretically by the PI can be achieved, (2) whether enhancement of wave motion can be realized as predicted, and (3) to demonstrate experimentally that the Squire's theorem can be violated. Objective (4) is to extend the stability theory to a multilayer system, and (5) to investigate the weakly nonlinear effects of the wave motion. Broader impacts of the proposed research was not discussed explicitly by the PI, but three graduate students will be trained per year.</AbstractNarration>
