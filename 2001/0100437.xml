    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is concerned with operator theory and function theory&lt;br/&gt;involving the generalized Schur and Nevanlinna classes and&lt;br/&gt;two-isometries on Pontryagin spaces. A generalization of Nudelman's&lt;br/&gt;problem in interpolation theory will be studied. In the classical&lt;br/&gt;case, existence criteria were given by M. Rosenblum and the PI using&lt;br/&gt;the commutant lifting theorem. The criteria imply a series of&lt;br/&gt;classical interpolation results with both interior and boundary data.&lt;br/&gt;The Ball and Helton generalization of the commutant lifting theorem&lt;br/&gt;yields an extension of Nudelman's problem to the generalized Schur&lt;br/&gt;class which has similar applications. New problems for boundary&lt;br/&gt;interpolation and Hilbert transforms arise in the indefinite case and&lt;br/&gt;will be studied in joint work with T. Constantinescu and A. Dijksma.&lt;br/&gt;D. Z. Arov and the PI will study Darlington synthesis for&lt;br/&gt;J-contractive matrix-valued functions in the unit disk. State spaces&lt;br/&gt;now are Pontryagin spaces. The approach follows previous work by Arov&lt;br/&gt;and also uses the factorization theory for pseudo-continuable&lt;br/&gt;functions by Rosenblum and the PI. L. A. Sakhnovich and the PI will&lt;br/&gt;study indefinite cases of direct and inverse problems for canonical&lt;br/&gt;differential and difference equations by the method of operator&lt;br/&gt;identities. A recent Ph.D. dissertation by C. Hellings obtains a&lt;br/&gt;generalization of Richter's theorem on analytic two-isometries on&lt;br/&gt;Pontryagin spaces. This area is new and includes a number of open&lt;br/&gt;questions and possibilities for further developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is concerned with problems in areas of mathematics which&lt;br/&gt;have traditional connections with engineering and control theory and&lt;br/&gt;especially the design of stabilizing feedback controllers and passive&lt;br/&gt;networks. The main problem of interpolation theory is to reconstruct&lt;br/&gt;a function from partial information such as given values of the&lt;br/&gt;function at specified points. Usually the data of a problem satisfy a&lt;br/&gt;positivity condition depending on the class of functions under&lt;br/&gt;consideration. The proposal will study a unified method to deal with&lt;br/&gt;one class of such problems in which the positivity conditions are&lt;br/&gt;replaced by weaker assumptions. The inverse problem of spectral&lt;br/&gt;theory, which asks to reconstruct an operator from observed spectral&lt;br/&gt;properties, is related to interpolation theory, and the effect of&lt;br/&gt;weakening positivity will again be considered. Other problems are&lt;br/&gt;related to the embedding of a passive system into a conservative&lt;br/&gt;system: extensions will be considered in which systems contain active&lt;br/&gt;as well as passive elements. Conservative systems correspond in some&lt;br/&gt;sense to isometric operators, and another group of problems explores&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of isometric operators in the absence of positivity.&lt;br/&gt;The projects are in collaboration with colleagues in the U.S. and&lt;br/&gt;Europe. Funding of the project will also provide support for an&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research program in the Mathematics Department of the&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia that matches students one-on-one with&lt;br/&gt;mathematics professors for projects of approximately eight weeks in</AbstractNarration>
