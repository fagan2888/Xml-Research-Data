    <AbstractNarration>Mitochondrial phylogenomics: Investigation of fish phylogeny and nucleotide character sampling in large-scale phylogenetic analysis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Molecular systematics employs variation in DNA to reconstruct historical&lt;br/&gt;relationships among organisms and investigate evolutionary processes that&lt;br/&gt;have given rise to the earth's biodiversity. The growing volume of DNA&lt;br/&gt;sequence data and the increasing number of characters and/or species that&lt;br/&gt;may be included in evolutionary investigations have placed greater&lt;br/&gt;importance on methods of phylogenetic analysis and experimental design. It&lt;br/&gt;is intuitive that the more data that can be applied to a phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;question, the greater the probability of recovering an accurate estimate of&lt;br/&gt;the phylogeny. Although phylogenetic accuracy may be positively correlated&lt;br/&gt;with the number of species sampled from a particular group, a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;question in molecular systematics remains: How many nucleotide characters&lt;br/&gt;are required to resolve the phylogeny of a given number of species,&lt;br/&gt;particularly when all (or most) of the extant members of a group have been&lt;br/&gt;sampled? This project will employ a large, robust phylogeny to investigate&lt;br/&gt;the sensitivity of phylogenetic analysis to nucleotide character sampling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ray-finned fishes (class Actinopterygii) exhibit extreme diversity&lt;br/&gt;with more extant described species than all other vertebrate groups&lt;br/&gt;combined and are of major ecological and economic importance. Despite&lt;br/&gt;extensive morphological study, phylogenetic relationships among many&lt;br/&gt;actinopterygian lineages remain unclear. This project will compile a data&lt;br/&gt;set of complete mitochondrial genomes from 73 species of ray-finned fishes,&lt;br/&gt;including representatives of 32 (out of 42) orders and extensive sampling&lt;br/&gt;from the two largest orders, Cypriniformes and Perciformes. Mitochondrial&lt;br/&gt;genomes are small chromosomes that are inherited independently of the&lt;br/&gt;majority of DNA found in the nucleus. The clonal, maternal inheritance of&lt;br/&gt;mitochondrial DNA makes it particularly useful in phylogenetic studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mitochondrial genome sequences, along with nuclear gene sequences, will be&lt;br/&gt;used to generate a robust hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among&lt;br/&gt;the most important lineages of ray-finned fishes. This data set will&lt;br/&gt;reveal patterns of diversification among fishes and provide important&lt;br/&gt;insights on the evolution of early vertebrates. The mitochondrial data, in&lt;br/&gt;conjunction with the best phylogenetic hypothesis, will then be used to&lt;br/&gt;investigate nucleotide sampling properties in phylogenetic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;Sub-samples of different numbers of species will be drawn from the group of&lt;br/&gt;73 species. For each sub-sample, the number of nucleotides required to&lt;br/&gt;recover the correct phylogeny, with various levels of support, will be&lt;br/&gt;determined. The influence of several important evolutionary parameters on&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic accuracy will be investigated. These parameters include a)&lt;br/&gt;the frequency of variable nucleotide sites in the sample; b) the amount of&lt;br/&gt;evolutionary divergence among taxa; c) the amount of evolutionary rate&lt;br/&gt;variation among included lineages; and d) the extent and distribution of&lt;br/&gt;nucleotide compositional bias among sampled taxa. The results will provide&lt;br/&gt;a deeper understanding of the behavior of nucleotide data in phylogenetic&lt;br/&gt;analysis and should identify a range of nucleotide sample sizes required&lt;br/&gt;for accurate estimation of phylogeny as a function of the number of taxa&lt;br/&gt;under investigation and relevant evolutionary conditions. Such objective&lt;br/&gt;criteria for experimental design will be of practical benefit to the field&lt;br/&gt;of molecular systematics by providing guidance in budgeting and allocation&lt;br/&gt;of resources and by improving the efficiency and accuracy of molecular&lt;br/&gt;phylogenetic studies.</AbstractNarration>
