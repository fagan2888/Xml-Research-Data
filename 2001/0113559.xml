    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program supports California Polytechnic State University with the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope with electron backscatter diffraction capabilities. The research that will utilize the equipment spans the disciplines of soil science, tribology, biomaterials, thin film science, metal-joining technology and the development of intermetallic alloys. The instrument will be used in undergraduate and Master's-level -science and engineering research and education programs. The goal is to expand the research opportunities for undergraduates, enhance the current courses and laboratories, seed a greater awareness of the benefits of materials research within industry and expand the opportunities for professional development of the faculty. This will be accomplished using four mechanisms: (1) Well-structured, yearlong research teams that target involving 50% females and 50% males; (2) Short-term industry-related projects aimed at promoting research for "real-world" challenges; (3) Senior-level and Master's-level research projects based on individual faculty research interests; and (4) Laboratory experiments incorporated into the curriculum for the purpose of educating the students on the use of an increasingly important materials characterization tool. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program supports California Polytechnic State University with the acquisition of a scanning electron microscope with electron backscatter diffraction capabilities.
