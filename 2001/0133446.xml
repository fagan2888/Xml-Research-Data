    <AbstractNarration>The investigator would investigate the role of context in critical thinking (making sure an author's points are clearly backed by evidence) across popular media. What are the needs of everyday critical thinkers and how can their needs be fulfilled? It will develop tools and training based on this research and train parents and teachers on the use of these tools. Then it will evaluate whether participation affects user practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researcher will examine the personal and social impact of scientific information from three studies of evolutionary science as perceived by college students and adults. It will concentrate on public understanding of the human genome project and human learning strategies. The project will use web-based forums as a vehicle for investigating these understandings. The interactions of teachers and students with the Web will be evaluated to determine whether informative tools that support student strategies and reflective exercises are needed.</AbstractNarration>
