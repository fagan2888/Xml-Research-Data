    <AbstractNarration>The goal of the research plan is to further our understanding of the relationship between two aspects of community behavior in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-the formation of complex, surface-attached communities called biofilms and a cell-to-cell signaling regulatory mechanism called quorum sensing. It is known that quorum sensing is required for normal P. aeruginosa biofilm communities to form, but what quorum sensing regulates during the development of a biofilm is unknown. How quorum sensing functions in biofilm community is also unknown. Here is a summary of the project: 1) Identify the gene or set of genes regulated by quorum sensing that play a role in the development of biofilm communities; 2) Study signaling patterns in biofilms- what constitutes a quorum in a biofilm?; and 3) Examine signal diffusion in a biofilm- concentrating both on the roles of mass transport and the chemistry of the extracellular matrix of the biofilm. Here is a list of the goals of the project:&lt;br/&gt;Develop a detailed understanding of quorum sensing in a model microbial biofilm system&lt;br/&gt;Develop interdisciplinary collaborations to address interdisciplinary questions&lt;br/&gt;Cultivate an appreciation for the multidisciplinary approach to science needed to ask questions about environmental microbiology&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan mirrors the research plan in the need to incorporate a multidisciplinary approach to the complex environmental systems where microbes are found. There are three specific goals for the educational plan:&lt;br/&gt;Design and implement a basic microbiology course for undergraduate engineers.&lt;br/&gt;Design and implement a microbial ecology course for graduate level engineering students.&lt;br/&gt;Provide research experiences for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in environmental microbiology, emphasizing the need to approach scientific questions in a multidisciplinary fashion&lt;br/&gt;The first goal is designed to give undergraduate engineers a foundation in biology. The need for engineers and scientists to interact with people outside their own discipline is clear- this course is intended to give the biological background needed to facilitate these interactions. The second goal is to develop a microbial ecology graduate course with the theme of biofilms, where the focus will be on systems and the need to bring different tools from different fields to bear on the system in order to understand it. The last goal is to provide a positive research environment where students can be trained in and exposed to cutting-edge research.</AbstractNarration>
