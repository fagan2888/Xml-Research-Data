    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses four perceived problems in instruction at the introductory level in Chemistry: a need for curriculum materials that will support an inquiry oriented instructional strategy; the difficulty students have linking macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic levels of understanding; a need for computer-based instructional materials that are simple, dynamic and interactive; a need to identify and address students' misconceptions. We are developing instructional materials that can be implemented as an integrated macroscopic (sensory)/microscopic/symbolic inquiry-oriented laboratory based instructional model. Specifically, we are developing eight Molecular Level Experiment (MoLE) Simulations: Gas Laws, Gas Phase Equilibrium, Kinetics, Atomic Structure and Periodicity, Acid-Base Chemistry, Calorimetry, Electrochemistry and Molecular and Solid State Structure. Each MoLE Simulation is a powerful, interactive, dynamic computer simulation, and is accompanied by a guided and open-inquiry laboratory activity. The materials help students link the macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic worlds together and allow them to develop a deeper understanding of these chemical phenomena. The materials also allow faculty and students to identify and address misconceptions students might have concerning the target concepts in each MoLE Simulation. Several different colleges and universities are testing and evaluating the proposed materials with their students under a number of additional instructional settings, including lecture, lecture supplements, homework assignment, computer laboratory, as either group or individual activities, and to introduce or verify concepts.</AbstractNarration>
