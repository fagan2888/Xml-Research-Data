    <AbstractNarration>In a continuation of productive studies of the taxonomy and phylogeny of the Sordariales, a large and ecologically important group of ascomycete fungi, Dr. Sabine Huhndorf of the Field Museum and her students and colleagues are focusing on the genus Podospora, one of the largest and most complex in the group (138 species worldwide), and related taxa. The genus is key to understanding relationships in the group, and is ecologically important as a dominant component of the dung decomposer mycota. Previous studies have shown that the large genera Lasiosphaeria and Cercophora form a monophyletic group together with Podospora and the model organisms Neurospora crassa and Sordaria fimicola. These relationships are significantly different from traditional classification schemes. While Podospora species have had a great deal of attention from a morphological standpoint, they have not previously been included in molecular systematic studies; and a revision of the genus incorporating molecular characters is essential for understanding their relationship among other taxa in the Sordariales. This study will serve as a model system for future studies in ascomycete systematics by using a multi-gene approach, incorporating both protein-coding and ribosomal genes, along with morphological characters for determining phylogenetic relationships at the specific, generic and familial levels. Both the monographic and the family level phylogenetic studies will be based on morphological and molecular data obtained from type and other herbarium specimens, newly collected specimens, and cultures. With the aid of digital image capturing systems, this study will produce detailed identification guides for taxa in the Sordariales. Results will be available via hard copy and over the Field Museum Mycology WWW site. The publication of the resulting monographs, specimen databases, on-line image catalog and interactive identification system will greatly assist further studies of ascomycetes by researchers worldwide. The research and training enterprise involves colleague Dr. Greg Mueller at the Field Museum as well as others in Denmark and New Zealand who will assist also with the fieldwork in those countries. Students will also participate in ongoing field work in Costa Rica and Ecuador.&lt;br/&gt;This program directly addresses several of the major challenges currently facing ascomycete systematics including: a) rigorously examining patterns of variation in some of the key morphological characters currently used in ascomycete taxonomy, b) stabilizing generic, familial and ordinal concepts using a phylogenetic approach, c) determining taxonomic diversity in tropical countries, d) integrating these data into monographic treatments, and e) training students to become well versed in traditional as well as modern tools and analyses. Understanding the phylogenetic relationships among ascomycetes is important because these fungi play an important role in our living world as decomposers of organic matter and as agents of plant and animal diseases, and as sources of medically and industrially significant compounds.</AbstractNarration>
