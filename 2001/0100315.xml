    <AbstractNarration>The Charles A. Dana Center of the University of Texas at Austin, will use a one-year planning grant to assess the design of standards-based mathematics and science resources for early childhood educators. The project will produce a prototype curriculum unit, based on "The Wonder of Water," which was developed as part of the Texas SSI Family Learning Project. The curriculum will be tested, revised and re-tested in six early childhood education settings. The results will be used to produce a plan to field test, research and disseminate the curriculum regionally and nationally, resulting in a strong resource for early childhood educators that will enable preschool children to develop an understanding and appreciation for math and science. By using this product in settings such as Head Start, a better sense of continuity will be established between preschool and elementary science and mathematics content.</AbstractNarration>
