    <AbstractNarration>Gibberellins (GAs) are phytohormones that regulate many aspects of plant growth and&lt;br/&gt;development. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis of GA&lt;br/&gt;signal transduction in arabidopsis. Loss-of-function spy mutations suppress the phenotypes&lt;br/&gt;caused by GA-deficiency; thus, the SPY protein is a suppressor of GA signaling. SPY has&lt;br/&gt;extensive sequence similarity to animal O-GlcNAc transferase, which catalyzes the addition of a&lt;br/&gt;single O-linked N-acetylglucosamine to specific serine and/or threonine residues of nuclear and&lt;br/&gt;cytosolic proteins. O-GlcNAc modification of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins is about as&lt;br/&gt;common as phosphorylation and is believed to be a regulatory modification. The work proposed&lt;br/&gt;here will test the model that SPY-catalyzed protein O-GlcNAcylation acts to negatively regulate&lt;br/&gt;GA signaling and begin to determine the details of how SPY functions in signaling pathway(s).&lt;br/&gt;SPY produced in insect cells is itself O-GlcNAc-modified and has GlcNAc transferase&lt;br/&gt;activity toward gp40, a plant nuclear pore protein that is known to undergo terminal O-GlcNAc&lt;br/&gt;modification. SPY is a component of a multiprotein complex present in both the nucleus and&lt;br/&gt;cytosol of arabidopsis and cauliflower. When GA-deficient plants are treated with GA, a&lt;br/&gt;decrease in the GlcNAc modification of several proteins is detectable 1 hr after treatment. spy&lt;br/&gt;mutations have similar effects. These data indicate that protein GlcNAcylation plays a role in&lt;br/&gt;GA signaling.&lt;br/&gt;A number of arabidopsis proteins that putatively interact with SPY's tetratricopeptide&lt;br/&gt;repeats in yeast have been identified. One of these proteins is GIGANTEA (GI), a protein&lt;br/&gt;involved in a number of processes that are also affected by GA. Consistent with the physical&lt;br/&gt;interaction between SPY and GI, with respect to the control of flowering time, spy is weakly&lt;br/&gt;epistatic to gi.&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this work are to: 1) characterize the protein modification that is produced by&lt;br/&gt;SPY and determine the identity of its substrates; 2) determine if the localization or activity of&lt;br/&gt;SPY is regulated by determining if changes in GA levels or mutations affecting GA signaling&lt;br/&gt;alter the localization, posttranslational modification, protein associations, or activity of SPY; and&lt;br/&gt;3) perform additional tests on the proteins identified in the two-hybrid screens to identify the&lt;br/&gt;proteins that physically interact with SPY and then genetically characterize the function of the&lt;br/&gt;interacting proteins. As part of the third goal, genetic and physiological studies will be&lt;br/&gt;performed to further define the functional interrelationships between SPY and GI.</AbstractNarration>
