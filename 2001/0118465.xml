    <AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Adria LaViolette, Lynn Koplin will direct archaeological&lt;br/&gt;excavations at Gede on the Kenyan coast, where she is conducting research&lt;br/&gt;for her doctoral dissertation. The project examines social&lt;br/&gt;differentiation in areas of earth-and-thatch domestic architecture at the&lt;br/&gt;major 11th-16th-century Swahili stonetown site. Because archaeologists have&lt;br/&gt;primarily concentrated on the stone components of these large,&lt;br/&gt;architecturally-mixed sites, currently little is known about activities,&lt;br/&gt;diet and material culture among the majority, the inhabitants of earthen&lt;br/&gt;dwellings, often assumed to have been undifferentiated non-elites. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will compare frequency and spatial organization of craft&lt;br/&gt;production, diet and wealth between stone and earth-and-thatch components of&lt;br/&gt;the same town, with a view to elucidating social differentiation within&lt;br/&gt;earth-and-thatch areas. When the distribution of activities and goods in&lt;br/&gt;non-stone neighborhoods are better understood, spatial variation in&lt;br/&gt;production and consumption may suggest axes of social differentiation, with&lt;br/&gt;which to trace social reorganization through time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The need to focus on intrasite variation, expressed in&lt;br/&gt;archaeologically-recoverable forms of production and consumption, is&lt;br/&gt;important as archaeologists attempt to elucidate indigenous forms of social&lt;br/&gt;complexity in sub-Saharan Africa. This is especially important as it&lt;br/&gt;relates to Swahili society, which until recently was attributed to external&lt;br/&gt;factors. This research is part of a new impetus on a larger level to search&lt;br/&gt;within Africa for the constitutive dynamics of African societies, and on&lt;br/&gt;Swahili sites in general this requires dismantling monolithic conceptions of&lt;br/&gt;the society by examining the overlooked majority, those in non-stone&lt;br/&gt;dwellings. Beyond the level of Swahili archaeology, this research draws on&lt;br/&gt;and will contribute to archaeological literature on the East African Iron&lt;br/&gt;Age, rise of complex societies, spatial organization and activity areas. &lt;br/&gt;The changes that accompanied the foundation, growth, contraction and&lt;br/&gt;abandonment of Gede fit into the larger history of the Iron Age&lt;br/&gt;efflorescence on the continent, and Africanist archaeologists are attempting&lt;br/&gt;to fill out the magnitude of activities such as pottery making, increased&lt;br/&gt;trade, specialized production, farming and other foodways that accompanied&lt;br/&gt;social expansion. Additionally, preliminary insights into the principles&lt;br/&gt;organizing neighborhoods of earthen architecture will engage the&lt;br/&gt;anthropological debates on spatial organization.</AbstractNarration>
