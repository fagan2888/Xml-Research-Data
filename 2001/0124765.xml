    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses the design, synthesis, characterization, processing and applications of novel multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts for environmentally benign and high efficiency organic transformations in aqueous media. It emphasizes metallic, organometallic-complex, and multifunctional catalysts capable of catalyzing multiple reactions simultaneously, examining the activity and selectivity of the catalysts for industrially important organic reactions, and engineering the structures and catalytic chemistry to achieve optimal performance through a fundamental understanding of catalytic reactions. This multidisciplinary project involving chemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, and environmental science provides a strong opportunity to integrate research with education to address important industrial issues such as how to reduce volatile and toxic organic pollutants in the environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new catalysts and methodologies for efficient and environmentally benign transformations of volatile organic pollutants will help achieve sustainable long-term economic growth while maintaining a cleaner industrial environment. Students trained in the synthesis, characterization, processing, optimization and recovery of catalysts will be highly competitive in both the academic and industrial job market. This Technology for a Sustainable Environment project is part of the National Science Foundation / Environmental Protection Administration partnership program. It is being jointly supported by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>
