    <AbstractNarration>EIA 0137743 &lt;br/&gt;Elrad, Tzilla H.&lt;br/&gt;Illinois Institute of Technology &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: ADVANCE Fellows: Aspect Oriented Framework for Software Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal, applying aspect-oriented (AO) approach, aims at building a framework design to open software systems in a systematic way that factors into the initial design the capacity to evolve, be extended, and be adaptive to future changes. The work will employ the Dynamic Weaver Framework (DWF) under development by the Concurrent Programming Research group lead by the PI. This framework allows for a separation of software system aspects from the system components, providing a systematic well-defined structure to open the software system to enable evolution, extendibility, and adaptation. Motivated by the increased complexity resulting from adding more basic software components, this research addresses the following for AO software systems:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modeling&lt;br/&gt;Supporting lifecycle development with End-to-End automation &lt;br/&gt;Experimenting with more real-life applications, with current case tools supporting the model, and with &lt;br/&gt;on-demand system re-modularization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aspect-oriented software development is an approach that cuts across functional components to present different views of software products. It supports and enhances software evolution by focusing on separation of concern issues, particularly to distributed systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this work are expected to demonstrate slower degradation in component cohesiveness, and improvements in maintainability and evolution capacity of systems that require inter-component dependencies and communication.</AbstractNarration>
