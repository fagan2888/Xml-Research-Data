    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;A Scholarship Program for Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Students:&lt;br/&gt;An Industry-Academia Partnership Approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program provides 25 undergraduate students $3125 per academic year provided the students are within two years of graduation. The program is managed to especially encourage applications from underrepresented groups and transfer students. All engineering majors as well as computer science and mathematics majors are eligible for scholarships. The program strengthens existing resources, as well as partnerships with community colleges and industry. The primary goal of the program is to supplement existing resources within the University to facilitate a life-altering, environmental change for financially disadvantaged, upper-division undergraduate CSEM students with academic potential. The goal is achieved by providing twenty-five, two-year scholarships supplemented with summer industry or research internships between the junior and senior years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has the following supporting objectives, each with specific, measurable outcomes, which are analyzed and serve as feedback to continually improve the program:&lt;br/&gt;1) Increase the graduation rate of CSEM students particularly minority and female students&lt;br/&gt;2) Decrease the average time to degree completion for CSEM students&lt;br/&gt;3) Decrease the number of CSEM students working in non-intellectually engaging jobs by increasing opportunities for students to work on a faculty member's funded research or through approved co-op or summer internships with industry partners of the program&lt;br/&gt;4) Improve employment placement in highly sought-after positions&lt;br/&gt;5) Increase the number of CSEM graduates who enroll in graduate school&lt;br/&gt;The objectives are achieved through a unique combination of student environment modifications, scholarships, retention and intervention, professional development and research activities, industrial collaborations, and academic support while leveraging and not replacing existing resources.</AbstractNarration>
