    <AbstractNarration>A Center for Learning and Teaching in Technology Education would provide a focus for educating teachers and teacher educators who could implement the ideas of technology education as described in the recently produced Standards for Technological Literacy, as well as in the AAAS Benchmarks and the National Science Education Standards. This planning grant is for the collaboration of the technology teacher education community and research communities in science and technology education. The planning determines a structure for graduate education in science and technology education, creates an agenda for research into how students learn technological concepts and how to use the information to implement the ideas of technological education in classrooms, and develops a technology teacher education curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
