    <AbstractNarration>March 11, 2002&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Michael Taylor, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0139726&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;********************************************************&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT FOR MICHAEL TAYLOR'S PROJECT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Taylor proposes to investigate problems in partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations, particularly in the areas of wave propagation, boundary problems &lt;br/&gt;for elliptic PDE, and functional calculus for elliptic self-adjoint &lt;br/&gt;operators. Taylor will study wave propagation in fairly rough media, &lt;br/&gt;in which rays of geometrical optics are just barely defined, and in even&lt;br/&gt;rougher media, in which such rays are not uniquely defined. He will examine&lt;br/&gt;to what extent wave propagation in such media behaves like that in more&lt;br/&gt;regular media and to what extent it differs. He plans to pursue the effects&lt;br/&gt;of curvature bounds on a manifold on the nature of such wave propagation,&lt;br/&gt;and also investigate propagation, reflection, and diffraction of waves at&lt;br/&gt;a boundary for a rough medium. Taylor will also continue a program of&lt;br/&gt;studying elliptic equations with rough coefficients on Lipschitz domains.&lt;br/&gt;This will include nonlinear equations, such as arise in the study of&lt;br/&gt;harmonic maps between manifolds with rough metric tensors. In the area&lt;br/&gt;of functional calculus, one attack is to synthesize general functions&lt;br/&gt;of the Laplace operator from the solution operator to the wave equation.&lt;br/&gt;A detailed knowledge of wave propagation can then yield highly nontrivial&lt;br/&gt;information on such functional calculus. Taylor is pursuing a variety&lt;br/&gt;of projects in this area, ranging from detailed behavior of eigenfunction&lt;br/&gt;expansions to singular perturbation problems arising in the study of &lt;br/&gt;pattern formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wave motion, from sound passing through air to pressure and shear waves&lt;br/&gt;passing through the earth to radio waves traveling through space, is&lt;br/&gt;a ubiquitous phenomenon, whose mathematical analysis has for a long time&lt;br/&gt;been a major part of mathematics. A variety of partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations have arisen to describe different aspects of wave motion, and their&lt;br/&gt;study continues to stimulate work on analytical tools to elucidate the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of solutions to such PDE. Analyzing a wave as a superposition &lt;br/&gt;of various frequencies gave rise to the area of harmonic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;Localizing the study of a wave simultaneously in space and in frequency is &lt;br/&gt;at the heart of the more recent area of microlocal analysis. Taylor has &lt;br/&gt;been active in developing tools in these areas and using them to produce&lt;br/&gt;results in PDE. Some of his efforts have focused on treating PDE with&lt;br/&gt;rough coefficients and PDE in domains with rough boundary. These arise&lt;br/&gt;to describe waves traveling through complicated media, whose boundaries&lt;br/&gt;have many corners and other irregularities. While harmonic analysis &lt;br/&gt;techniques have provided much insight into partial differential equations,&lt;br/&gt;the reverse direction has also led to significant results in harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis. Taylor is continuing to investigate how results on Fourier&lt;br/&gt;synthesis of singular functions can be explained in terms of propagation&lt;br/&gt;and focusing of waves.</AbstractNarration>
