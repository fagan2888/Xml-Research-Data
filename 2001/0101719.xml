    <AbstractNarration>This project is in direct response to the needs of the emerging biotechnology industry and involves major industrial companies that are developing strong technical capabilities in biotechnology such as AstraZeneca, DuPont, Gore and Hercules. Spanning the market from pharmaceuticals to health care, food, agricultural products, and biomaterials, the Delaware region is becoming a major source in biotechnology. As the biotechnology industry grows and matures, there is an increasing demand for well-trained biotechnicians in both research and manufacturing. Through the development of a Biotechnology Program, this project is enabling AAS degreed technicians to perform many of the same jobs and job tasks previously being done by BS degreed professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership with the Delaware Biotechnology Institution (DBI), its research facility and industry network, is serving as an extension of Delaware Tech's laboratories and provides a transition to the real world working environment. DBI provides a facility for faculty and students to learn new skills and applications in the field of biotechnology and assists college faculty and staff in determining short-term training needs of industry workers. This collaboration creates a unique opportunity for college faculty and students to use the latest laboratory and manufacturing equipment in the industry while learning alongside experts in the biotechnology field. A focus on functional genomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and bioimaging makes this program unique among community college biotechnology programs and builds upon the partnership with DBI which specializes in these research areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project incorporates adaptations of exemplary educational materials; upgraded laboratory equipment and experiments; student technical internships coordinated through the DBI; and extensive faculty development including attendance at workshops, seminars, and conferences and participation in technical internships coordinated by DBI. The biotechnology program serves a diverse student population including those who wish to graduate as AAS technicians and those who transfer to baccalaureate institutions. A certificate in Biotechnology, based on the program's capstone courses, is offered to individuals with baccalaureate degrees in science who need hands on experience in the biotechnology laboratory. Specialty training courses for technicians employed in the field provide continuing education opportunities to program graduates and others who wish to enhance their skills.</AbstractNarration>
