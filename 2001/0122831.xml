    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Gray has established an outstanding record in support of minorities and especially women in mathematics for more than thirty years at American University. Gray's academic history includes serving as department chair on multiple occasions, and as director of the women's studies program, as well as an extensive list of publications, including several on mentoring. The American Association for the Advancement of Science recognized her achievements in mentoring with its Lifetime mentoring Award. The American Association of University Professors bestowed the Georgina Smith Award on Gray in 1979 for her work on the status of women in collective bargaining. Gray is the founder and president of the Association of Women in Mathematics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gray has mentored twenty-three students through successful doctoral dissertations, including fourteen women and eight African-American students. She co-directed the Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship program at AU, providing tuition and stipends for thirteen doctoral students, including eleven women and five minority students. Her students have gone on to lead illustrious careers, including academic administrative posts such as College Dean and Provost, and becoming active mentors themselves.</AbstractNarration>
