    <AbstractNarration>With this renewal award the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division and the Solid-State Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research support the ongoing work of Dr. George Whitesides in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The work will explore the self-assembly of components at the meso-scale (micrometers to centimeters in size), using strategies modeled on molecular self-assembly. The work will be extended to smaller size, more complex topography (including 3D), and include electrical and optical functionality. It will explore the value of molecular and biomolecular concepts and analogies for the design of meso-scale, self-assembling systems, including analogues of bubble raft assemblies developed for condensed matter physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work at the meso-scale bridges the gap between devices with components at normal scale (cm) with those at the molecular level (nm), using concepts from chemistry and biology. The work is expected to develop new methods to prepare tiny electronic and optical devices that are difficult or impossible to make by current methods. Because of its interdisciplinary nature, it is expected to provide excellent training for the students involved.</AbstractNarration>
