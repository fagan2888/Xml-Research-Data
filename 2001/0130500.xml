    <AbstractNarration>0130500&lt;br/&gt;Fabrikant&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on resonances in small systems to be held in Saitama, Japan from July 22-24, 2002. The co-organizers are Professor Ilya Fabrikant at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln and Professor Mineo Kimura of Yamaguchi University in Japan. Collision processes in different environments are often driven by intermediate resonance states. They play an important role in a broad variety of scientific fields: atomic physics, nuclear physics, surface and condensed matter physics, chemistry, and biological sciences. Even in complex processes involving many particles it is often possible to extract few-body resonance effects responsible for observed phenomena. On the other hand, each field of science has its own method in treating these effects. Therefore, it is important for specialists in each particular field to get together and discuss their own findings and problems, to exchange ideas and to learn about the methods used in other fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the seminar will provide a good opportunity for closer interactions between electron scattering and positron scattering groups, surface and atomic physics groups and interaction between other branches of science. The project advances international human resources through the participation of many junior faculty, postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to publish proceedings of the seminar in the Plenum Press.</AbstractNarration>
