    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this projectl is to investigate the structural and catalytic&lt;br/&gt;properties of Fe-Only hydrogenases. Hydrogenases catalyze reversible hydrogen&lt;br/&gt;oxidation and function physiologically to either recycle the reduced electron carriers that&lt;br/&gt;accumulate during a fermentative metabolism or couple the oxidation of hydrogen to the&lt;br/&gt;generation of reduced electron carriers that can be utilized in energy yielding processes.&lt;br/&gt;The metal-containing hydrogenases are classified according to their metal content and&lt;br/&gt;include those that contain both Ni and Fe (NiFe-hydrogenases) and those that contain just&lt;br/&gt;Fe (Fe-Only hydrogenases). These enzymes are of paramount importance in the&lt;br/&gt;metabolism of numerous microorganisms. In addition, since hydrogen is being explored&lt;br/&gt;as a future alternative fuel source, there is considerable interest in the details of these&lt;br/&gt;hydrogen producing biological catalysts. The studies will focus primarily on testing hypotheses that&lt;br/&gt;were developed as a result of the detailed structural analysis of the Fe-Only hydrogenase&lt;br/&gt;(CpI) isolated from the anaerobic soil microorganism Clostridium pasteurianum. The specific objectives are (1) additional structural and biochemical studies on CpI probing a number of remaining key questions with respect to the H Cluster structure and the role of the accessory [FeS] clusters; (2) site-specific&lt;br/&gt;amino acid substitution experiments on CpI to examine the role of the polypeptide&lt;br/&gt;environment of the H Cluster in catalysis and stability; (3) structural characterization of&lt;br/&gt;the second Fe-Only hydrogenase (CpII) from C. pasteurianum to ascertain its primary&lt;br/&gt;sequence and structural relationship to other Fe-Only hydrogenases and to probe the&lt;br/&gt;contributions of the environment of the H Cluster and the accessory FeS clusters in&lt;br/&gt;defining hydrogen oxidation versus proton reduction activities in the Fe-Only&lt;br/&gt;hydrogenases. The above objectives will be pursued by a multidisciplinary approach combining&lt;br/&gt;biochemical methods, spectroscopic methods and structure determination by X-ray&lt;br/&gt;diffraction methods to answer some of the key remaining questions with respect to the&lt;br/&gt;structure and function of Fe-Only hydrogenases.</AbstractNarration>
