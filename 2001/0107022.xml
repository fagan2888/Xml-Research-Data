    <AbstractNarration>This is a study of teaching learning science in three neighborhood high schools in Philadelphia, Pa. The study seeks to understand the teaching and learning of science in terms of student use of their existing social and cultural capital to make sense of the activities they participate in during school and after school. It would involve six teacher-researchers who are involved with a local systemic initiative in which the teachers are teaching courses in chemistry. The schools are also involved with the Philadelphia's Urban Systemic Initiative. The study would examine learning of science in different institutional settings "to ascertain how students and teachers interact to give meaning to their environment." It will seek to learn how teachers in poor urban environments gain the respect of and build rapport with their students. It will answer other questions such as, "when students act in ways that are resistant to the goals of the teacher, how do teachers adapt their teaching to provide opportunities."</AbstractNarration>
