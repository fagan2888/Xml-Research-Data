    <AbstractNarration>Using a modular building block strategy, conjugated molecules and polymers containing polyoxometalate (POM) clusters covalently linked in a variety of architectures will be synthesized for the first time. The proposed research stems from a recent discovery of a novel reaction protocol which allows the efficient and facile functionalization of POM clusters with a variety of aromatic amines and the recent demonstration that functionalized POM clusters can undergo Pd-catalyzed organic coupling reactions. The proposed hybrid systems not only represent truly new and novel classes of functional materials where strong electronic interactions exist between delocalized d-electrons, they are also expected to possess extremely interesting electrical and optical properties. Preliminary studies clearly demonstrate the suitability of the proposed modular building block approach.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The educational goal of this Career Development plan is threefold: to be an excellent mentor producing creative and productive scientists, an efficient instructor promoting chemical science education, and a passionate community member assisting the local school district with its science education. A new teaching style has been brought to the Organic Chemistry class and students' response has been extremely positive. Strong efforts have been and will continue to be made towards training science teachers for the local community and exposing young high school students to research laboratories. The proposed research is geared toward discovery of new chemistry and innovative materials. The planned educational activities represent combined efforts in effective education and community involvement. They form a unified career plan, a journey toward becoming a creative researcher and an effective educator.</AbstractNarration>
