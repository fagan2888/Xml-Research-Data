    <AbstractNarration>0104019&lt;br/&gt;Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to study the shock wave theory for conservation laws and &lt;br/&gt;the Boltzmann equation in the kinetic theory. Shock waves occurs in many &lt;br/&gt;natural phenomena, such as supersonic flight, sonar wind, earthquakes and &lt;br/&gt;hurricanes. There is now a satisfactory mathematical theory for the &lt;br/&gt;inviscid plane motion. It is planned to study the multi-dimensional gas &lt;br/&gt;motion as well as the dissipation effects. The Boltzmann equation models &lt;br/&gt;the gas motion on the microscopic level. This is necessary for important &lt;br/&gt;physical phenomena such as the thermal effects of the boundary on the gas &lt;br/&gt;motion. The nonlinear waves and the boundary effects for the Boltzmann &lt;br/&gt;equation will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Euler equations and Navier-Stokes equations for the gas dynamics are &lt;br/&gt;considered. The project will include the study of the nonlinear stability of &lt;br/&gt;shock waves for these and more general systems of hyperbolic-parabolic &lt;br/&gt;conservation laws. The approach combines the pointwise estimates and the &lt;br/&gt;energy estimates and is based on the new understanding of the structure of &lt;br/&gt;the Green's function for the equations linearized about the shock. For the &lt;br/&gt;Boltzmann equation, the positivity of Boltzmann shocks has been shown &lt;br/&gt;and the boundary effects such as the thermal creep are being studied. &lt;br/&gt;These are based on the new macro-micro decomposition of the Boltzmann &lt;br/&gt;equation and time-asymptotic analysis.</AbstractNarration>
