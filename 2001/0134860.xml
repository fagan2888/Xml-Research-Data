    <AbstractNarration>Sottile will work on projects ranging from research in algebraic geometry &lt;br/&gt;and algebraic combinatorics, to strengthening links between algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry and applied science, to educational outreach. His work in algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry will focus on concrete aspects of flag manifolds and their Schubert&lt;br/&gt;varieties, involving a range of problems from the real Schubert calculus, from &lt;br/&gt;extensions of quantum Schubert calculus, from combinatorial problems in &lt;br/&gt;Schubert calculus, and from the geometry of Schubert varieties. This will &lt;br/&gt;deepen our understanding of computation, combinatorics, and real-number &lt;br/&gt;phenomena in algebraic geometry. Sottile will study structural properties of&lt;br/&gt;certain combinatorial Hopf algebras, work that has applications to polytopes, &lt;br/&gt;to the Schubert calculus, and to certain combinatorial schemes in physics. &lt;br/&gt;He is actively engaged in applications of computational algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry to other fields,particularly discrete geometry and the applied sciences. &lt;br/&gt;A unifying theme in this scientific work is studying concrete mathematical &lt;br/&gt;objects using computer experimentation to inform theoretical work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While algebraic geometry is concerned with abstract questions about &lt;br/&gt;solutions to equations, its value to other disciplines is largely through concrete &lt;br/&gt;objects and computational tools. A major activity of this project is to help &lt;br/&gt;disseminate the modern computational tools from algebraic geometry to &lt;br/&gt;other fields, including the applied sciences, through research collaboration, &lt;br/&gt;organizing conferences, and co-authoring a textbook on algebraic geometry &lt;br/&gt;for applied scientists. Sottile will also organize an outreach program for talented &lt;br/&gt;high school students in Western Massachusetts with the particular goal of&lt;br/&gt;serving the needs of students in nearby urban areas, many of whom come&lt;br/&gt;from groups traditionally underrepresented in science. The intention of &lt;br/&gt;this work: the research, the technology transfer, the service and the outreach, &lt;br/&gt;is to provide a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated research and &lt;br/&gt;educational activities for Sottile.</AbstractNarration>
