    <AbstractNarration>Lay abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Long-term changes in synaptic function induced by selective&lt;br/&gt;suppression of activity in single neurons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The adaptation of the brain to environmental changes is achieved in part&lt;br/&gt;through modifications in the strength of synapses, which are specialized&lt;br/&gt;connections between neurons. The precise rules governing synapse&lt;br/&gt;formation, maturation and subsequent modification in the central nervous&lt;br/&gt;system are not fully understood. Using electrophysiology, fluorescence&lt;br/&gt;microscopy and molecular biological tools, Dr. Murthy will investigate&lt;br/&gt;long-term modification of identified synapses in a simple neural network&lt;br/&gt;in vitro. The overall research objectives of the proposal are (i) to&lt;br/&gt;determine the consequences of selective, long-term reduction of activity&lt;br/&gt;in a single neuron within an active network, and (ii) to understand the&lt;br/&gt;locus and mechanisms in synaptic modification resulting from this&lt;br/&gt;manipulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two general classes of results might be anticipated - homeostatic&lt;br/&gt;modifications that allow neuron-wide increase in synaptic strength that&lt;br/&gt;will restore the overall activity of the 'quiet' cell to normal levels,&lt;br/&gt;and competitive modifications that reduce or eliminate synaptic input and&lt;br/&gt;output of the 'quiet' cell. This experimental system will offer&lt;br/&gt;unparalleled access to detailed cell biological investigations of synaptic&lt;br/&gt;modification - from the level of gene expression to physiological analysis&lt;br/&gt;at single synapse resolution. The investigator will also integrate&lt;br/&gt;education with his research program by developing up-to-date instructional&lt;br/&gt;material for an advanced course in neuronal cell biology. Since optical&lt;br/&gt;microscopy has become an indispensable tool in cellular-level research,&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Murthy will organize short departmental workshops on advanced imaging&lt;br/&gt;techniques. In addition to these instructional elements, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;will also mentor undergraduate and graduate students, including those from&lt;br/&gt;underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
