    <AbstractNarration>The ICP/21 project provides an innovative curriculum in introductory physics, offering an attractive, student-centered alternative to the standard lecture/laboratory format using conventional textbooks. For the two-semester course, 10 content modules and a supplemental skills toolkit have been developed. Each module consists of activities designed to encourage active student engagement using the following models: inquiry and experimentation activities (Explorations), reinforcement exercises (Dialogs), expanding-the-concept activities (Extensions), assessments (Ranking Tasks), and Application ( which require groups of students to solve engineering problems involving several physics concepts). This project is: (1) conducting a full-scale field test (2) developing three additional modules needed to meet the needs of many technology programs, and (3) implementing a dissemination plan with a commercial publisher. The full scale field test of ICP/21 involves participants from the high school, two year college and four year college teaching communities. An external coordinator is responsible for all aspects of the field test. The results of the field test are used to improve and strengthen the ICP/21 modules. The test also gives data and information related to the success of module implementation in the classroom, and the impact it has on the students in understanding the concepts of physics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the first phase of the ICP/21 project, physics teachers have repeatedly asked for additional modules in physics areas not covered in the original 10 modules. As a result of this input, three new modules are being developed: electrostatics, fluids, and physical optics. The third component of the project is to conduct a major dissemination program for ICP/21. This is being done in conjunction with a commercial publisher, Ztek. Ztek is a publisher that specializes in electronic media for physics and physical science. Because of the innovative nature of the ICP/21 material, most instructors will need training or assistance in using it in the classroom. The role of the instructor is much different when using the ICP/21 material properly than when in a traditional classroom lecture format. During the field testing and initial implementation this will be done through workshops. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluations are being done by an independent evaluator, who has been the evaluator during the first phase. The evaluation is concentrating on three areas. The first is to monitor the modules and make sure they fulfill what was promised in the first phase of the project. The second is to evaluate the efforts of this phase, and determine its effectiveness for student learning. The third area will be to evaluate the effect of ICP/21 on students' attitudes and feelings about physics. This information will complement the field test results to give a complete picture of the effect of ICP/21 on student learning.</AbstractNarration>
