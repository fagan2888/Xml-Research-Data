    <AbstractNarration>RNA-binding proteins are critically important to many regulatory processes in the cell. The&lt;br/&gt;largest family of RNA-binding proteins carries one of more RNA recognition motif domains&lt;br/&gt;(RRMs). RRM-containing proteins occur in all living organisms, and play a role in most&lt;br/&gt;processes involving RNA, including splicing, RNA export, translation, and mRNA decay. U1A&lt;br/&gt;is a spliceosomal protein that carries two RRMs. Its N-terminal RRM mediates tight and specific&lt;br/&gt;binding to its RNA hairpin target (U1hpII)in U1 small nuclear RNA. U1A is one of the most&lt;br/&gt;extensively studied RNA-binding proteins and has been used as a paradigm for specific and tight&lt;br/&gt;RNA recognition by RRM-type proteins. However, to date the knowledge of the mechanism of&lt;br/&gt;RNA-binding by U1A and other RNA-binding proteins has been largely limited to a static&lt;br/&gt;image, in which the dynamics underlying the interactions are poorly understood. This project is&lt;br/&gt;aimed at obtaining detailed kinetic insight into the U1A/U1hpII interaction using powerful state-&lt;br/&gt;of-the-art BIACORE technology to observe, in real time, the assembly and dissociation of the&lt;br/&gt;RNA/protein complex. Analysis of the kinetics of the U1A/U1hpII interaction will help elucidate&lt;br/&gt;the sequence of events that occurs during binding. More importantly, it will also provide general&lt;br/&gt;insights into the dynamics of RNA/protein interactions, an area that has thus far remained largely&lt;br/&gt;unexplored. Knowledge of the kinetics of RNA/protein interactions is highly relevant, since&lt;br/&gt;biological systems are dynamic; the rates of binding and release can affect the sequential&lt;br/&gt;assembly of RNA/protein complexes and the function and intracellular localization of RNA-&lt;br/&gt;binding proteins, as well as their ability to compete for binding sites on RNA.</AbstractNarration>
