    <AbstractNarration>The George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) is a project funded under the National Science Foundation (NSF) Major Research Equipment appropriation. The goal of NEES is to provide a national, networked simulation resource of 20 or more geographically-distributed, shared use, next-generation experimental research equipment sites, with teleobservation and teleoperation capabilities, which will transform the environment for earthquake engineering research and education through collaborative and integrated experimentation, computation, theory, databases, and model-based simulation to improve the seismic design and performance of U.S. civil and mechanical infrastructure systems. NEES will be constructed through September 30, 2004, and then enter its operational period from October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2014, during which time it will be operated by a NEES Consortium (to be established under this award). This 36-month cooperative agreement with the Consortium of Universities for Research in Earthquake Engineering (CUREE) is to conduct the project entitled "George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Consortium Development." This award is the outcome of the peer review of proposals submitted to program solicitation NSF 01-56, "George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES): Consortium Development." The extensive project team is led by CUREE and includes individuals from the following organizations: Civil Engineering Research Foundation, Cornell University, Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, Louisiana State University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Oregon State University, San Jose State University, University of California at Berkeley, University of California at San Diego, University of Kansas at Lawrence, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, University of Minnesota at the Twin Cities, University of Southern California, and University of Texas at Austin. This project team will outreach extensively to the earthquake engineering community, NEES System Integration awardee, and NEES equipment site awardees to accomplish three major tasks. First, this project will organize and run activities to gain community-generated input and broad consensus for the organizational structure and governance of a single community-based and community-led NEES Consortium. These activities must culminate in the completion by October 1, 2003, or earlier, of all documents required for NEES Consortium establishment and operation and in a proposal submitted to NSF for ten-year operation of NEES (FY 2005-FY 2014). Activities are included during the period from October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2004 to enable start-up operation of NEES by the NEES Consortium. Second, this project will organize activities to facilitate community-generated input and consensus needed by the NEES system integration awardee for detailed network design. Third, this project will coordinate outreach and training activities for the NEES equipment sites as they become operational before September 30, 2004. To accomplish this scope of work, project activities will include national workshops, regional workshops, white papers, and working groups with membership from the earthquake engineering community. This project will maintain an interactive web site to keep the earthquake engineering community informed of activities and progress. Project activities will be coordinated by an Executive Council. These tasks, critical self-assessment, and project management will be conducted in accordance with the awardee's Project Execution Plan. NEES and this award are part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program.</AbstractNarration>
