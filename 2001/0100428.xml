    <AbstractNarration>Fast FTIR imaging using newly available Focal Plane Array detectors and step-scan interferometers allows the acquisition of multicomponent images of the diffusion process from which the nature of the diffusion process and the magnitude of the diffusion constants can be measured. The images allow the detection of anomalous diffusion in the polymer samples arising from voids or cracks. These studies will be initially directed at characterization of the role of residual and diffusing water in poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA). The initial studies will be made on diffusion of water into ultrapure and ultradry PMMA samples of varying molecular weights and at different temperatures above and below the glass transition. The PI will study the plasticizing effect of residual water in PMMA on the diffusion behavior of other substances. Solid state NMR will be used to measure the changes in the polymer dynamics due to the presence of water in the PMMA in order to determine the impact of polymer chain mobility. The PI will study the role of physical aging of the PMMA and establish the correlations of multicomponent diffusion with the changes in the average size of microcavities or voids in the glassy polymer (measured by Positron Annihilation Lifetimes). Subsequently, multicomponent diffusion studies will be made with water and environmental agents to determine the role of substance molecular size, shape and chemical interactions on the multicomponent diffusion process. Additionally, the PMMA will be systematically oxidized and the role of gradient in polymer degradation from the surface to the bulk evaluated. The experimental results will be compared with current theories of molecular diffusion. The experimental images will be utilized as visualization aids in an educational module (PCL.cwru.edu) which will be used to interactively teach students the mechanisms and parameters of the diffusion process in polymers.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award, co-funded by the Division of Materials Research and Chemical and Transport Systems, is directed toward the utilization of a powerful analytical tool-Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Imaging for the study of diffusion of multicomponent penetrants into polymers. Diffusion of small molecules such as monomers, catalysts, diluents, and solvents in materials is of vital importance in many applications. Information concerning diffusion coefficients is necessary in many industrial processes such as devolatization, polymerization, membrane separation, crying, coating, and painting. The plasticization, coloration, curing and drying of coatings are all influenced by the mobility of solvents, dyes, and low molecular weight additives.</AbstractNarration>
