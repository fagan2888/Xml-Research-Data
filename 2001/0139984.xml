    <AbstractNarration>0139984&lt;br/&gt;Lieb&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of the interaction of many particles, e.g., atoms,&lt;br/&gt;raises significant physical and mathematical questions, some of which go back to the early days of quantum theory and statistical mechanics. The theory encompasses such classical subjects as the stability of solids as well as some very recent experimental developments on the strange and wonderful properties of trapped gases of bosonic atoms -- which might eventually shed light on how to store information on ultra-small scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the topics in this project two stand out for particular&lt;br/&gt;emphasis. One is the understanding of Bose-Einstein condensation and&lt;br/&gt;superfluidity in Bose gases. Considerable progress in this area has&lt;br/&gt;already been made in previous grants by the PI and collaborators. The&lt;br/&gt;other concerns ongoing attempts to understand quantum electrodynamics&lt;br/&gt;which continues to be one of the most accurate physical theories, yet&lt;br/&gt;one of the most puzzling because of its internal inconsistencies. The PI will continue his attempts to reconcile quantum electrodynamics with true many-body physics.</AbstractNarration>
