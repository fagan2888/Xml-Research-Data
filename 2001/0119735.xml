    <AbstractNarration>Submitted under the guidelines for Developmental Centers for Learning and Teaching, this one-year project is a collaboration among Appalachian State University, Louisiana State University, Rice University and the University of Houston, Downtown. The universities will partner with school systems, museums, observatories and industries to provide a support network that will enhance the preparation and continuing professional development of teachers, while involving mathematicians, scientists and their students in mutually beneficial collaborative activities with teachers, their school systems and their students. All the institutions already have working relationships with school systems that serve at-risk students. Support by a foundation grant in their professional development of mathematics and science teachers first brought the four institutions together. As research aims, the proposed Center will explore two recurring themes: the importance of context (geographic, social, economic, etc.) and of informal enrichment of formal methods of instruction in learning mathematics and science. Working with science museums, observatories, school districts and industrial partners, they will develop plans to integrate and expand their science and mathematics education activities to address critical national needs in the following ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increase the quality and number of teachers of mathematics and science being prepared at the four partner universities through scholarships and increased opportunities for meaningful field-based experiences;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* strengthen and extend mathematics and science programs for in-service teachers, especially in the development of support teachers -- those who will take leading roles in interactions with novice teachers and university students;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* increase the quality and number of doctorates of mathematics and science education being prepared at LSU through scholarships and through internships with the other partner universities; develop fertile environments for research in mathematics and science education in the partner universities, schools, museums, and observatories; and support doctoral dissertation studies within this research environment.</AbstractNarration>
