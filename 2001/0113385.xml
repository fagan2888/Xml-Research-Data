    <AbstractNarration>ITR Small Proposal &lt;br/&gt;Collaborative: 0113385/0112591&lt;br/&gt;Sayeed/Popovic&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reliable and seamless wireless connectivity in varied environments is a necessary requirement for the rich and diverse communications of the future. Space-time processing has emerged as a key enabling technology for future wireless communications: signal space dimensions are fundamental to reliable communication and antenna arrays augment the traditional dimensions of time and frequency with the spatial dimension. While recent theoretical and technological advances provide a tremendous boon for modern communications, the state-of-the-art is far from realizing the full potential of space-time processing due to significant gaps in our current understanding on two fronts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental mechanisms underlying the interaction of the space-time channel with the signal space in spatial, temporal, and spectral dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jointly optimized design of front-end hardware, antenna arrays, and signal processing algo-rithms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of the work proposed here is an integrated approach to the design of antenna array hardware and space-time processing algorithms for significantly improved wireless link performance&lt;br/&gt;at reduced cost and complexity.</AbstractNarration>
