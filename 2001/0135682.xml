    <AbstractNarration>Project Abstract&lt;br/&gt;SES Proposal 0135682&lt;br/&gt;Scientific Pluralism, A Workshop to be held at the University of Minnesota Oct. 10-13, 2002 &lt;br/&gt;C. K. Waters, University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports a small interdisciplinary workshop entitled "Scientific Pluralism" at the University of Minnesota, October 10 - 13, 2002. The Principal Investigators are bringing together leading philosophers of science and scientists who have independently advanced views consistent with the idea that some natural phenomena cannot be fully explained by a single theory or fully investigated using a single approach. The aim of the workshop is to develop an understanding of the various forms of pluralism being advanced and to explore their philosophical implications. The goal is to determine whether a consistent philosophical account of scientific pluralism can be developed that goes beyond the mere rejection of the unity of science doctrine. This workshop brings together philosophers who have advanced pluralist solutions to puzzles encountered in their analysis of science with practicing scientists. The philosophers and scientists participating in the meeting represent a broad range of sciences including physics and mathematics, biology, and social and behavioral science. Philosophical participants are focusing their research and workshop presentations on detailed case studies that warrant pluralist interpretations. Workshop discussion includes scientists' commentaries on the detailed case studies and general discussions on the broad philosophical implications of the presented works. The Principal Investigators plan to publish results of the workshop in a volume of "Minnesota Studies in Philosophy of Science."</AbstractNarration>
