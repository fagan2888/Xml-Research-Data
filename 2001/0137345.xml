    <AbstractNarration>0137345&lt;br/&gt;Burrill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on lesson study in mathematics teacher education to be held in Park City Utah from July 12-18, 2002. The co-organizers are Dr. Gail Burrill of the Mathematical Sciences Education Board at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and Professor Toshiakira Fujii of Tokyo Gakugei University in Japan. The goal of the seminar will be to discuss in detail how the concept of lesson study can be framed as a medium for professional development, to identify common research priorities related to lesson study, and to explore possible areas of joint research cooperation. The meeting will focus on lesson design and classroom practice, considering K-8 teachers in each country, and how lesson study might be adapted for use at the secondary level. The framing of the seminar will be done jointly by educators from both countries under the direction of a Steering Committee representing the different constituencies and considering balance factors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seminar will provide an opportunity for mathematics educators from the United States to probe into the underpinnings of lesson study, to learn how the Japanese think about mathematics and teaching mathematics, how they orchestrate discussion among teachers, and how they consider what is implicit in lesson study that helps teachers understand what it takes to teach well. The results can serve as the focus of follow-up activities in the U.S., stimulate teacher educators into thinking differently about their practice, and lay the groundwork for research concerning questions about the role of lesson study in professional development. Participants will be selected to include both ethnic and geographic diversity considerations as well as women and young researchers. The proceedings will be made available on the National Academy of Sciences web site.</AbstractNarration>
