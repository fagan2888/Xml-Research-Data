    <AbstractNarration>Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM) is one of the most promising and best-known techniques for probing magnetic phenomena on length scales approaching 10 nanometers, but the spatial resolution of MFM is presently limited to about 30 nanometers. Factors limiting the spatial resolution include both the the force sensitivity of the cantilevers used for MFM and the ability to create controlled magnetic nanostructures on the cantilevers. The PIs propose that MFM sensors based on the integration of nanomagnets, carbon nanotubes, and optimized silicon microstructures can push these limits to allow sub-10-nm spatial resolution. The PIs individually have experience in atomic force microscopy, novel magnetic microscopies, the growth of single-walled and multi-walled carbon nanotubes, the integration of carbon nanotubes with silicon microstructures, the growth and characterization of cobalt nanomagnets and nanorods, and the fabrication of high-bandwidth ultra-sensitive force cantilevers with integrated displacement sensors. This research requires the participation of an interdisciplinary research team, populated by a collection of graduate and undergraduate students from many departments in science and engineering. The fabrication of these sensors will require the integration of advanced nanomaterials and modern fabrication processes, benefiting researchers and industrial developers. The processes that are developed during the course of this research will be published in the NNUN's on-line process library, as well as in research journals. Undergraduate and graduate students whose research includes the development of these techniques and their application to materials science will be well suited to make ongoing contributions to nanoscience and technology. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Research on "nanomaterials" such as bucky-balls, nanotubes, nanomagnets, molecular manufacturing, and many other examples has led to excited speculation regarding the technological promise of nanoscience. However, these nanotechnologies do not easily merge with conventional technologies, including microfabrication. Stanford has recently demonstrated methods for localizing the growth of carbon nanotubes on specific locations within a conventional microfabrication process, a breakthrough that could allow nanotechnology to approach important technological applications. The propsed work would use this breakthrough to integrate nanotubes and nanomagnets into MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) fabrication, producing a useful new family of ultrasensitive physical probes and developing realistic processes for the integration of nanomaterials and silicon microstructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 00-119). The award is jointly supported through two directorates at NSF: (i) Mathematical and Physical Sciences and (ii) Biological Sciences. Additional support comes from the National Facilities and Instrumentation program of the Division of Materials Research (DMR).</AbstractNarration>
