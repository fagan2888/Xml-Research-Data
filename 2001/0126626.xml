    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning &amp; Develoment Across Cultures: A Workshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Patricia M. Greenfield&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of two workshops (a planning meeting and a larger conference) will bring together international scholars to formulate a research agenda and a program of research activities. The cultural construction of learning and its relation to development is the rationale for the workshop. A developmental perspective will guide the organization of the workshop topics: (1) Learning in infancy across cultures; (2) Learning in childhood across cultures; (3) Adolescent learning across cultures; (4) Adulthood learning across cultures; and (5) Learning and aging across cultures. The objective will be to scrutinize learning similarities and differences as a way of understanding development. The multiphase approach will help learning scientists understand the developmental precursors and learning phenomena, as well as developmental consequences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the workshop will include a reseach agenda to guide the development of future research projects about children's learning in varying cultural contexts. Another anticipated outcome will be a book that can serve as an international textbook on the role of cultural differences and universal stages in human development.</AbstractNarration>
