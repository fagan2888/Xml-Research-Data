    <AbstractNarration>Proposal: EAR-0137983&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jordan&lt;br/&gt;Title: Moving EarthScope Forward: A Series of Workshops for Science and Coordination&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant is intended to support a series of workshops that will help to prepare for the construction and coordination of the EarthScope facility, which is a proposal to NSF's Major Research Equipment account. EarthScope is a bold interdisciplinary initiative developed by a broad segment of the Earth Science community to apply modern observational, analytical and telecommunications technologies to investigate the structure and evolution of the North American Continent, and the active tectonic processes that shape our land. It will contribute to the mitigation of risks from geological hazards - including earthquakes and volcanoes, the development of natural resources, and the public's understanding of the dynamic Earth. Workshops supported by this grant will focus the science, advance coordination among the EarthScope components, and communicate the essence of the initiative to the full scientific community, other federal agencies, state geologists, local officials, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
