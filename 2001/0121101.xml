This proposed IPAP assignee is uniquely qualified and available for this assignment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In assessing the relative benefits to INR and the parent organization of this IPA, ONR is determined to be the principal beneficiary because of its critical need for his expertise and agrees to pay 100% of the salary, fringe benefit and travel costs.
