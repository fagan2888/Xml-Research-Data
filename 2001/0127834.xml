    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will explore the processing of boron nitride (BN) composites for a wide variety of wear applications with a focus on aircraft brakes. Significant research has been performed worldwide to develop greatly improved braking materials at significantly lower cost. Of the approaches under consideration, a composite using BN as a matrix appears best in terms of desired cost-performance characteristics. Phase I will produce stable boron nitride composites from a unique pre-ceramic polymer (borazine) that allows for simple impregnation. The oxidative and hydrolytic stability of these composites is greatly improved over current carbon fiber/carbon (C/C). Based on preliminary testing, a carbon fiber/carbon-BN matrix displayed a five-fold decrease in wear as compared to C/C.&lt;br/&gt; C/C matrix composites have been used extensively for both military and commercial aircraft brakes since they were first developed in the mid-1960s and later optimized in the early 1970s. Problems with such systems include rapid wear at elevated temperatures leading to frequent replacement. In fact, commercial airlines consider the maintenance of brakes to be the second most serious cost problem.</AbstractNarration>
