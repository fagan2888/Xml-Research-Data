    <AbstractNarration>The Helicosporidia are a unique assemblage of pathogens isolated from a diverse group&lt;br/&gt;of invertebrates with only one named species-Helicosporidium parasiticum. Morphologically,&lt;br/&gt;this group is defined by the production of an unusual cyst stage that encloses three ovoid cells and a single elongate, filamentous cell. These organisms were at one time considered to be &lt;br/&gt;protozoa or fungi but have been unclassified since 1931. Experiments outlined in this project&lt;br/&gt;utilize the expertise of three research teams to explore the structure and function of this novel&lt;br/&gt;pathogen. The approach taken in this project, dictated by the lack of biological information on&lt;br/&gt;this organism, will provide a combination of morphology, life history, and molecular data. The&lt;br/&gt;outlined objectives include a complete analysis of the in vitro developmental cycle of the&lt;br/&gt;Helicosporidium sp. with an emphasis on the ultrastructure and replication of vegetative cells and&lt;br/&gt;the morphogenesis of the infectious cyst. Preliminary examination has revealed that&lt;br/&gt;Helicosporidia possess many unique cytological features, such as a pellicle that is formed by both&lt;br/&gt;vegetative and cyst phenotypes, nuclei that enclose the cytosol, a number of undefined cell&lt;br/&gt;organelles, and a harpoon-like filamentous cell. The combination of high-resolution light and&lt;br/&gt;electron microscopy will provide detailed insight on the composition and structure of the surface,&lt;br/&gt;wall structure, and internal morphology of this organism. Under controlled in vitro conditions,&lt;br/&gt;time-lapse microscope studies will provide details on the developmental cycle of this pathogen.&lt;br/&gt;Secondly, the in vivo infection process, development, and host range of the Helicosporidium sp&lt;br/&gt;will be examined. Throughout the course of this study, cell-tracking technologies will be&lt;br/&gt;optimized to analyze the ingress of this pathogen through the midgut barrier and its subsequent&lt;br/&gt;development in the hemocoel. Unlike many insect diseases, Helicosporidium sp., although&lt;br/&gt;isolated from an aquatic environment, can infect a wide range of terrestrial insect hosts. For&lt;br/&gt;comparative purposes, both mosquito and lepidopteran larvae will be used to document the in&lt;br/&gt;vivo cell cycle. To date, sequence data generated on rDNA and two proteins, actin and tubulin,&lt;br/&gt;have demonstrated that Helicosporida belongs within the Chlorophyta and, as such, it represents&lt;br/&gt;the first record of an insect-pathogenic alga. It should be noted that Helicosporidia nests&lt;br/&gt;hierarchically within a group of organisms with radically different morphologies and life history&lt;br/&gt;traits, allowing for comparative studies that can shed light on genes and structures that were&lt;br/&gt;modified to achieve parasitism. Molecular studies will be directed at generating sequence&lt;br/&gt;information on select genes from the Helicosporidium sp. and on EST libraries. A primary goal is&lt;br/&gt;analyze the relationship between the genera Helicosporidium, Prototheca, and other members of&lt;br/&gt;the Trebouxiaphyceae in order to gain a better understanding of the morphological, molecular,&lt;br/&gt;and genetic changes that are correlated with the evolution of parasitism. Furthermore, analysis of&lt;br/&gt;this sequence data in conjunction with morphological (ultrastructural) features will define the&lt;br/&gt;taxonomic status and phylogeny of this organism. This project will provide support and training&lt;br/&gt;for two graduate students and two undergraduate research assistants. The goal is to leverage the&lt;br/&gt;combined talents of this group to provide students interdisciplinary training in molecular systematics,&lt;br/&gt;histology, and pathology. These skills are crucial for the discovery, characterization, and&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of microbials for applications to a broad range of scientific disciplines such as new&lt;br/&gt;pest control technologies, novel protein and small molecule discovery, etc.</AbstractNarration>
