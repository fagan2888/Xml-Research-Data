    <AbstractNarration>Proposal 0112654&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reliability Theory of Software Designed Using Components&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dick Hamlet, Portland State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Defining, developing, and reusing software components is today accepted&lt;br/&gt;as the best line of attack on the problem of expensive and unreliable&lt;br/&gt;software systems. In other engineering disciplines, component-based&lt;br/&gt;systems have been the key to rational design, in which engineers can&lt;br/&gt;predict the behavior of complex systems before they are built and&lt;br/&gt;tested. This research focuses on the quality of software components.&lt;br/&gt;A foundational theory is developed to allow the designer of a system,&lt;br/&gt;working from data sheets that describe proposed components, to estimate&lt;br/&gt;the reliability of the system that will result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Goals of this research are:&lt;br/&gt;-- To develop a quantitative, mathematical description of the way in&lt;br/&gt;which component reliability measurements can be made and later used for&lt;br/&gt;calculating system reliability.&lt;br/&gt;-- To experiment with the theory in simple, revealing cases, to expose&lt;br/&gt;problems in the theory and improve it by experimental feedback.&lt;br/&gt;-- To implement research-prototype support tools, particularly for the&lt;br/&gt;system designer, that make experimentation easier.</AbstractNarration>
