    <AbstractNarration>The research is centered on four major computational themes which &lt;br/&gt;are linked in various ways:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Quantum Computation: &lt;br/&gt;A study of novel quantum algorithms, of entanglement as a computational &lt;br/&gt;resource, and of connections to fundamental issues in quantum physics, &lt;br/&gt;such as the transition from classical to quantum. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Modeling the Regulatory Processes of the Cell:&lt;br/&gt;In the post-genomic era, the computational modeling of the operation &lt;br/&gt;of an entire cell at the level of interactions among genes, proteins &lt;br/&gt;and environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Statistical Physics and Computational Complexity: &lt;br/&gt;A study of central concepts of statistical physics, such as phase &lt;br/&gt;transitions and critical exponents, with emphasis on their computational &lt;br/&gt;manifestations and their relevance to the analysis of large systems &lt;br/&gt;with local interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Mathematical Economics and the Internet: &lt;br/&gt;A study of the Internet as a novel computational artifact and a complex &lt;br/&gt;economic arena, as well as of the algorithmic adaptations of Game Theory &lt;br/&gt;and Mechanism Design necessary for such a study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four PIs --- Richard Karp, Christos Papadimitriou, Alistair Sinclair &lt;br/&gt;and Umesh Vazirani --- are all based in the Computer Science Division at &lt;br/&gt;UC Berkeley. Each of them has a track record of research in at least one &lt;br/&gt;of the above areas, and a substantial interest in at least one other. &lt;br/&gt;The project also includes one senior scientist from each of the four areas: &lt;br/&gt;Birgitta Whaley (Quantum Physics), Adam Arkin (Quantitative Biology), &lt;br/&gt;Yuval Peres (Probability and Statistical Physics), and Scott Shenker &lt;br/&gt;(Economics and the Internet). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is rooted in a realization that a computational perspective &lt;br/&gt;is becoming increasingly important in the Natural and Mathematical Sciences,&lt;br/&gt;and conversely that the Sciences are posing new challenges for the theory &lt;br/&gt;of computation, many of which are related. It aims to foster this connection &lt;br/&gt;within a dedicated program of research and graduate education.</AbstractNarration>
