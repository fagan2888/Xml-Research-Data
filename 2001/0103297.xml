    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering' (NSF 00-119). This Nanoscale Interdisciplinary Research Team (NIRT) will produce and characterize photonic structures containing ordered elements on length scales ranging from the molecular (&lt; 1 nm) to the macroscopic (mm) by the patterning of self-organizing block copolymers. Self-Assembled Polymer microphotonics has the potential for the ready production of precision optical devices or elements using low cost materials and simple processing steps. The team will study 1, 2, and 3 dimensionally periodic photonic materials with finely tuned optical properties. Such materials will have probable impact on technologies for communications devices, sensors, integrated devices and related electro-optic technologies. The team will design and create the required polymers, cany out the proposed processing and characterize and measure the resulting nanostructures and anticipated electro-optical devices. The patterning of block copolymers offers remarkable possibilities for size control on much smaller length scales than currently possible and with intricate geometries and functions not realizable with convcntional lithography alone. In addition to advances in microphotonics, the success of this project has the potential to completely revolutionize the way all routine lithographic nanopatterning is carried out and to open up new strategies for integrating soft materials onto a silicon device platform. Team members consist of four Cornell faculty, Christopher Ober, (team leader), Geoff Coates, Sol Gruner and Uli Wiesner plus Edwin Thomas of MIT and Nitash Balsara of UC Berkeley. Both Balsara and Thomas are internationally recognized experts in the study and control of block copolymer microstructure. Thomas is also a pioneer in the field of block copolymer microphotonics. Coates, Ober and Wiesner are known for their ability to synthesize unique polymers and Gruner for characterization expertise. Our partners (Rohm &amp; Haas and Wright Materials Labs) are established centers for research in lithography and the optical behavior of materials, respectively and will provide valuable expertise to this NIRT.</AbstractNarration>
