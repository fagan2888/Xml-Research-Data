    <AbstractNarration>Fort Valley State University (FVSU) has sustained the commitment to its mission &lt;br/&gt;and strategic plan of providing quality educational experiences for under &lt;br/&gt;represented minority group individuals (who constitute 93% of enrolled students), &lt;br/&gt;equipping them for productive and effective citizenry in an increasingly&lt;br/&gt;competitive society. A recent benchmarking, study conducted by the University &lt;br/&gt;System of Georgia, hailed FVSU as one of the top four institutions in the State with &lt;br/&gt;a competitive retention rate of 70% or better. Additionally, 88% or more of FVSU's &lt;br/&gt;biological sciencesgraduates are placed in medical or graduate school. We proposes&lt;br/&gt;to build upon this successful tradition of minority group retention and graduation &lt;br/&gt;from general baccalaureate degree programsby increasing more broadly the number &lt;br/&gt;of minority group graduates who pursue advanced studies in Science, Mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;Engineering, and Technology (SMET). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is requested to achieve the primary goals of increasing the number of minority &lt;br/&gt;students graduating with a major in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology &lt;br/&gt;(SMET) by 30%, and achieving a 10% increase over a five- year period in the number of &lt;br/&gt;SMET graduates pursuing master and doctoral degrees. There are three strategic &lt;br/&gt;initiatives being proposed to achieve these goals namely: i) enhancing the recruitment, &lt;br/&gt;and retention, of SMET major, ii) enhancing the infrastructure for providing technology if&lt;br/&gt;used and research-based SMET courses of instruction, and iii) providing career &lt;br/&gt;awareness opportunities in SMET field of study. These goals will be achieved via &lt;br/&gt;achievement of five interrelated objectives: 1) Enriching the academic preparation of&lt;br/&gt;students in SMET disciplines by focusing on developing course reform and enhancement,&lt;br/&gt;2) Broadening and strengthening the research program for faculty development, &lt;br/&gt;3) Strengthening the partnerships with academic institutions and industrial labs to&lt;br/&gt;enhance quality research experiences for students, 4 ) Infusing technology into teaching,&lt;br/&gt;research, and professional development, and 5) Enhancing critical transition activities &lt;br/&gt;to improve access and retention of undergraduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objectives will be accomplished in different phases: revising gateway courses and &lt;br/&gt;improving the performance of students in SMET gate-keeping bottleneck courses via&lt;br/&gt; including research/lab exercises and providing students tutorial assistance. Faculty &lt;br/&gt;enrichment activities will improve their research skills, collaborative research will &lt;br/&gt;provide wide exposure to students to opportunities to become familiar with SMET &lt;br/&gt;programs. Providing `hands-on experience'' to students using the state-of-the art&lt;br/&gt;facilities and other enrichment activities will improve their skills, and motivate them&lt;br/&gt;to pursue graduate studies. Student participation will be promoted by financial &lt;br/&gt;assistance as work study/stipend, and by summer internships at major research &lt;br/&gt;institutions. Bridging initiative to address high school/ undergraduate-graduate-&lt;br/&gt;job market transitions in SMET fields will also be established. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this project will: 1) substantially increase the number of &lt;br/&gt;minority graduates in SMET disciplines and increase the proportion of those graduates&lt;br/&gt; who pursue advanced degrees in these disciplines through bridging and career awareness &lt;br/&gt;programs; 2) strengthen faculty expertise and capability to mentor students as &lt;br/&gt;researchers, and overall commitment to continued professional development as SMET&lt;br/&gt; scholars - a 10% increase in faculty research projects, publications, linkages, and &lt;br/&gt;grantsmanship will be attained; 3) promote gains in learning through the provision &lt;br/&gt;of a revised SMET curriculum which builds on increased faculty interactions with the &lt;br/&gt;incorporation of inquiry-based pedagogy; and 4) promote the greatest potential for student&lt;br/&gt; enrollment and success in SMET disciplines by enhancing the physical infrastructure (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt; teaching/ research facilities) of the university. &lt;br/&gt;Dr. Sarwan Dhir, Assistant Professor, having strong project management experience will&lt;br/&gt;direct the program under the supervision of Dr. Josephine Davis, Vice President Academic &lt;br/&gt;Affairs. A Leadership Team of the Chairs of the SMET departments and an Advisory Committee &lt;br/&gt;of internal and external distinguished scientists will conduct an annual review of the program &lt;br/&gt;outcomes as well as formative evaluation as the program is developed. The results of this &lt;br/&gt;project will be disseminated widely in the professional community through presentations &lt;br/&gt;at regional and national/scientific meetings and publications in scientific journals. &lt;br/&gt;The general public will have access to the successful efforts of this project through FVSU &lt;br/&gt;web site. The commitment of Fort Valley State University is evidenced from the supporting &lt;br/&gt;letter from Dr. Oscar L. Prater, President, FVSU, and overall supervision of Vice President&lt;br/&gt;for Academic Affairs and participation of Dean's, on the Advisory Committee, release &lt;br/&gt;time for faculty, matching cost of the equipment, and allocation of physical facilities &lt;br/&gt;for the teaching and research laboratories and use of other facilities and resources. &lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the mission of the University through its provision of high &lt;br/&gt;quality degree programs that increase the participation of minority group graduates&lt;br/&gt;in higher education.</AbstractNarration>
