    <AbstractNarration>0138115&lt;br/&gt;Manson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports a US-India collaboration entitled Relativistic Effects in the Photoionization of Free and Confined Atoms. US PI Steven Manson, Georgia State University (GSU) and Pranawa Deshmukh, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras will continue to develop theoretical methodologies and perform calculations that explore ionizing collisions of electromagnetic radiation with atoms and ions. They will develop the relativistic random phase approximation (RRPA) methodology and apply it to a number of diverse problems in the area of ionization of free and confined atoms and ions by electromagnetic radiation. The investigators will work closely with experimental groups to insure quantitative accuracy of the newly developed methodologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This research will provide further insight into the nature of fundamental atomic processes. By extending atomic theory methodology to confined atoms, the PI brings the expertise of atomic physics to bear on the broader fields of chemistry and condensed matter. Additionally, greater understanding of the properties of confined atoms may yield insight into the new physics of a largely unexplored area and possibly to the development of a whole new class of devices. The PIs have a highly productive collaboration and many joint publications to their credit. This project will enable a US graduate student to do research at the Indian collaborating institution and will contribute to internationalizing students at both universities. Additionally, it will facilitate the build-up of an internationally competitive research program at the IIT, Madras.</AbstractNarration>
