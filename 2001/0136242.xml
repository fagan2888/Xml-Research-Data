    <AbstractNarration>Jeffrey Lucas&lt;br/&gt;University of Akron&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will complete a pilot study that examines why men are more likely than females to self-handicap. Individuals self-handicap when they select actions that they are aware will inhibit future performances, usually with the goal of deflecting attention away from one's personal abilities. Research on self-handicapping consistently finds that men are more likely to self-handicap than women across a variety of age groups and settings. Efforts at determining the causes of this difference have met with limited success. There are two potential explanations of the gender difference in self-handicapping. One explanation comes from socialization theories. These theories indicate that males are socialized to be more competitive than females. It may be that males are more concerned with the evaluative outcomes of performances and that this leads to more self- handicapping behaviors. Status processes also may partially account for gender &lt;br/&gt;differences in self-handicapping. In US culture in many situations, men tend to have higher status than women do. Theories of status indicate that higher performances are expected from high status group members. The investigator will conduct a controlled laboratory study to test predictions derived from both socialization theories and status characteristics theory. The PI will randomly assign male and female participants to high and low status group positions and measure self- handicapping behavior across gender and status. Pilot data from the study will be used to develop a larger, regular proposal to the National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>
