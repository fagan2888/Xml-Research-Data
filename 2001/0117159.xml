    <AbstractNarration>The concept of social norms is central to social psychology, yet the usefulness of social norms to predict and understand human behavior has been limited by conceptual and operational problems. One reason for potentially weak norm-behavior prediction is that people's motivational goals for conforming to norms are likely to vary across situations. Based on earlier social influence research, a tripartite model of motivational goals underlying norm effects is proposed: informational motives based on accuracy and successful adaptation, social motives with implications for the self, and social motives stemming from concern with others and the outcomes these others can provide. Furthermore, groups establish ideal rules of conduct and acceptable behavior, and they provide information about successful, adaptive behavior. Thus, when a particular group identity is activated, the social norms associated with that group should direct individual behavior, especially when the individual values and identifies with the group. This project focuses on the collection of pilot data to identify pre-existing norms associated with specific target groups and to develop valid measures of the motivations that underlie people's conformity to social norms. This research will improve our understanding of when and how social norms impact individual behavior, and may help us learn how the norms of one important group can override the norms of another important group.</AbstractNarration>
