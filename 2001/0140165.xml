    <AbstractNarration>PI: Leonid Bunimovich&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0140165&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research deals with the studies of finite- and&lt;br/&gt;infinite-dimensional dynamical systems as well as of some&lt;br/&gt;hybrid (intermediate between dynamical and stochastic) systems.&lt;br/&gt;The class of hybrid systems which will be specifically addressed&lt;br/&gt;is formed by deterministic walks in random environments. It has &lt;br/&gt;been shownrecently that a large subclass of such systems (walks&lt;br/&gt;in rigid environments) is completely solvable in 1D. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;study deals with the case of environments with variable rigidity.&lt;br/&gt;Another part of the proposal deals with the farther development of&lt;br/&gt;recently constructed first natural examples of Hamiltonian systems&lt;br/&gt;with divided phase space. The goal now is to show that a rather &lt;br/&gt;general class of such billiards has positive metric entropy in &lt;br/&gt;any (finite) dimension. The considered problems of statistical &lt;br/&gt;mechanics deal with the rigorous derivation of formulas for &lt;br/&gt;kinetic coefficients and for escape rate in open systems. Among &lt;br/&gt;the problems which deal with infinite-dymensional systems are &lt;br/&gt;chaos-order transitions in Lattice Dynamical Systems and chaos &lt;br/&gt;in nonlinear wave equations. Other problems deal with various &lt;br/&gt;systems ranging from the Ergodic Theory (Benford's law)&lt;br/&gt;to some simple models of brain dynamics and logistics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Traditionally the mathematical models of real systems are &lt;br/&gt;either purely deterministic or purely stochastic. These two &lt;br/&gt;classes of models enjoy having a rich theory, and researchers &lt;br/&gt;have quite good intuition on their behavior, i.e. they basically &lt;br/&gt;know what to expect. This intuition is essentially based on a &lt;br/&gt;rich collection of completely solvable (i.e. completely &lt;br/&gt;understood) models. However, a majority of real systems are &lt;br/&gt;neither purely deterministic nor purely stochastic. Instead &lt;br/&gt;they have both (deterministic and stochastic) features. This &lt;br/&gt;project deals with a big class of such models which were &lt;br/&gt;independently introduced in communication theory, statistical &lt;br/&gt;physics,chemical kinetics, theory of artificiall intellect, etc.</AbstractNarration>
