    <AbstractNarration>This project (Minority Engineering Transfer and Articulation Program - META) is a joint effort by Santa Fe Community College, New Mexico State University, the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department, and three civil engineering firms. It supplements the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP). META's goals are to provide a connected and coordinated educational pathway from associate's degree programs in engineering technology to bachelor's degree programs in civil engineering and to create instructional materials that emphasize technology applications in civil engineering. The summer bridge program includes an industry-sponsored design project, a new technology course, guidance workshops and seminars. There are also summer internships, industry sponsored tuition and book scholarships, faculty development seminars and workshops, comprehensive student advising, and multi-level recruitment strategy. It addresses minority issues and updates an outdated Civil Engineering curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
