    <AbstractNarration>This award is establishing a digital imaging and data analysis center of networked computers and image acquisition equipment for use at all levels across the science curriculum. The facility is modeled after a successful digital imaging laboratory in the Department of Biology at Franklin and Marshall College (DUE 9750430) and is adapted for our interconnected science departments. The award is (1) engaging students in an active manner in the process of scientific inquiry through digital imaging, (2) promoting collaborative research between students through instant data exchange and projection, and (3) demonstrating the inter-relatedness of scientific disciplines by linking courses that share imaging as an experimental approach. In order to achieve these aims, faculty who represent all science departments and in whose courses greater than 60% of all students in the College are enrolled are utilizing the facility each year. Several of the courses are incorporating cross-disciplinary laboratory exercises. This project is impacting in a positive fashion student performance in science, student perceptions of science, and recruitment of students into science majors. Results of this project will be widely disseminated through workshops, poster presentations, publications, and websites.</AbstractNarration>
