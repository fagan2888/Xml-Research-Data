    <AbstractNarration>0107347&lt;br/&gt;Molles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twentyfour months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four month postdoctoral research fellowship for Dr. Laura E. Molles to work with Dr. Joseph Waas at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;This project will involve the examination of duetting in an endemic New Zealand bird, the kokako, to explore the advantages of duetting over the far better-known songbird strategy of solo singing. Hypotheses regarding the mate-guarding, pair-bond maintenance, and territory defense functions of duets will be tested using recordings, observations, and playback experiments. Kokako have been decimated by deforestation and the introduction of mammalian predators to New Zealand. The islands of New Zealand are inhabited by some of the most unique and endangered bird species in the world, including the Kokako. Scientific efforts have focused intensively on issues related to preservation of threatened species. Little is known about these species' social behavior and communication systems. Understanding their behavior can lead to improvements in management of endangered populations. In this study, examination of male-male and male-female duets may provide a means to identify same-sex pairs without the disturbance of capture and cost of genetic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Waas has begun in-depth studies of kokako songbirds and his lab has produced the first description of their duets, documented the genetic diversity within mainland populations, and explored ranging in male-male and male-female pairs.</AbstractNarration>
