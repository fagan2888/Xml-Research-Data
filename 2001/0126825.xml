    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13) A new optics initiative at Calvin College is providing students with marketable technical&lt;br/&gt;training in the optical sciences and introduces an optics concentration and an optical-&lt;br/&gt;technology minor into the physics curriculum. The programs target students in physics&lt;br/&gt;and engineering, as well as pre-service teachers preparing to teach science in high school.&lt;br/&gt;Curricular changes include the reconfiguration of several physics courses and the&lt;br/&gt;introduction of an intermediate-level course entitled Phys 246: Waves, Optics, and&lt;br/&gt;Optical Technology. Based on a mentor/apprentice pedagogical model, this course will&lt;br/&gt;make use of a fully integrated lab-plus-lecture format, an approach with which Calvin's&lt;br/&gt;science-education specialists have already had great success in courses for pre-service&lt;br/&gt;elementary school teachers. The new pedagogical method will also influence the way in&lt;br/&gt;which students are mentored in a new upper-level lab course, Phys 383-384: Advanced&lt;br/&gt;Optics Laboratory. The project involves adaptations of labs for both the intermediate&lt;br/&gt;and the advanced courses, so that the optics initiative can effectively address its two-fold&lt;br/&gt;goal of cultivating technological knowledge and skill and providing a fresh model of&lt;br/&gt;teaching by hands-on inquiry.&lt;br/&gt;The labs are adapted from labs used at other institutions and from the&lt;br/&gt;research projects of the PI and Co-PI. The curriculum for Phys 246 is taken largely from&lt;br/&gt;a course at the University of Maryland taught by Dr. Wendell T. Hill, who is&lt;br/&gt;providing advice on a continuing basis. Certain individual labs (at both intermediate and&lt;br/&gt;advanced levels) are based on existing experiments and input from faculty at Caltech,&lt;br/&gt;Harvard, Harvey Mudd College, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.&lt;br/&gt;Still others are a natural outgrowth of the PI's research on laser-cooled and trapped&lt;br/&gt;atoms and plasma diagnostics and the Co-PI's research on diode-laser applications and&lt;br/&gt;spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>
