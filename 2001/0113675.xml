    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will allow the University of Pittsburgh to purchase a video imaging system that will allow the principal investigators to follow individual particle motion and spreading of dyes in a 2D flowing soap film. The video system consists of a high-speed (1000 fps) video camera and a 5Watt solid-state laser. The latter serves as an intense light source for illuminating the particles and for excitation of the dye. The system is one of general utility and will serve to train graduate as well as undergraduate students in fluid dynamics and state-of-the-art measurement techniques. The idea of using topology to study 2D turbulence is entirely new and promising results just beginning to emerge. The requested video system will further our fundamental understanding of turbulence phenomena which are important for a wide range of practical problems, such as weather patterns, dispersion of biological agents in air and in water, chemical reactions, and crystal growth..&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program will allow the University of Pittsburgh to purchase a video imaging system that will allow the principal investigators to follow individual particle motion and spreading of dyes in a 2D flowing soap film.
