    <AbstractNarration>Biotechnology and genetic engineering have become major social issues in the&lt;br/&gt;United States and around the world. In 1998, Durant, Bauer, and Gaskell&lt;br/&gt;published Biotechnology in the Public Sphere, which contained profiles of&lt;br/&gt;twelve European nations in terms of public perceptions, policy decisions,&lt;br/&gt;and media discourse. At that time, a collaboration with researchers in the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. was developed, leading to another book to be released in the Fall 2001,&lt;br/&gt;which contains surveys conducted in 17 European nations, Canada, and the&lt;br/&gt;U.S. Another round of surveys to measure public perceptions is scheduled&lt;br/&gt;to take place in late 2001 or early 2002. These surveys will help to understand from &lt;br/&gt;a longitudinal perspective how the public is changing (ornot changing) their &lt;br/&gt;views towards such things as genetically modified crops,medical biotechnology, &lt;br/&gt;and food containing genetically engineered products. This project will support a&lt;br/&gt;national telephone survey within the U.S. and will be coordinated with the &lt;br/&gt;comparable survey in Europe. This survey will also support analysis and publications&lt;br/&gt;aimed at not only gaining an insight into the issue of biotechnology, but also social &lt;br/&gt;change and the social construction of social problems.</AbstractNarration>
