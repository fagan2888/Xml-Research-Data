    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0140408&lt;br/&gt;Complex Dynamics in Higher Dimension&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to study the dynamics of meromorphic&lt;br/&gt;self-maps of compact complex manifolds. If such a map expands some&lt;br/&gt;cohomology class of the manifold, then the main idea is that there ought&lt;br/&gt;to be a distinguished invariant current representing this class.&lt;br/&gt;Intersections between invariant currents should in turn give rise to&lt;br/&gt;invariant measures that describe the distribution of orbits where the&lt;br/&gt;action of the map is most complicated. Hence the linear action of a&lt;br/&gt;meromorphic map on cohomology should go a long way toward determining a&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic picture of the pointwise dynamics of the map. To justify &lt;br/&gt;these ideas, the investigator proposes to use a combination of techniques&lt;br/&gt;from complex geometry, smooth ergodic theory, and pluripotential&lt;br/&gt;analysis. Various problems in physics and mathematics reduce to questions&lt;br/&gt;about the dynamics of particular meromorphic maps. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;proposes to use some of these as starting points and test cases for his&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of dynamical systems has grown increasingly important in the&lt;br/&gt;past several decades. Put briefly, a dynamical system is anything--e.g. &lt;br/&gt;the weather, the stock-market, the solar system, etc--that evolves in&lt;br/&gt;time according (at least theoretically) to definite and codifiable rules.&lt;br/&gt;The general goal in studying a dynamical system is to make predictions&lt;br/&gt;about its future state given its present one. If the future is very&lt;br/&gt;far off then this, as any honest forecaster will admit, is typically quite &lt;br/&gt;difficult. Small changes in the present state of the system can imply &lt;br/&gt;huge differences in eventual outcome. The research proposed here is&lt;br/&gt;devoted to better understanding instability in dynamical systems--when&lt;br/&gt;it occurs, why it occurs, and how to recognize it. The research is also&lt;br/&gt;devoted to attaining partial control over instability by making&lt;br/&gt;statistical predictions about the eventual behavior of an unstable system&lt;br/&gt;that do not depend on perfect understanding of its present state. The&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems that the investigator proposes to study are mathematical&lt;br/&gt;in nature, but they are also archtypes for the systems that one analyzes&lt;br/&gt;in connection with real-world phenomena. The idea is that weather and&lt;br/&gt;the stockmarket and the solar system ought not be treated as a separate&lt;br/&gt;and totally unrelated dynamical systems but as particular examples&lt;br/&gt;of the same general phenomena and subject to similar kinds of analyses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;**********************************</AbstractNarration>
