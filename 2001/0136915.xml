    <AbstractNarration>CAMDA (Critical Assessment of Microarray Data Analysis Techniques) was founded to initiate a community-wide critical assessment of different techniques used in analysis of microarrays. It provides a forum for a cross-section of research looking at a common data set and applying innovative analytical techniques. The conference aims to establish the state-of-the-art in microarray data mining, as well as identify progress and highlight the direction for future effort. CAMDA is a functional genomics successor of other experiments such as GASP in genome annotation and CASP in protein structure prediction. Over 250 scientists attended the first meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two data sets will be made available for analysis. The conference also includes oral and poster presentations. Abstracts will be published electronically and links will be made for the analytical tools. Attendance of students is particularly supported.</AbstractNarration>
