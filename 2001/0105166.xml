    <AbstractNarration>CCR-0105166&lt;br/&gt;Luqi&lt;br/&gt;Naval Postgraduate School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"Monterey Workshop 2001- Engineering Automation for Software Intensive System Integration"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A 3-day workshop, to be held in Monterey, CA on June 19-21, is organized for the dissemination and integration of recent research results related to the production of reliable cost-effective software in heterogeneous environments. A major goal of the workshop is to help the software engineering community focus on issues that are vital to improving the state of software engineering practice, including all topics related to supporting engineering automation of reliable, cost-effective, integrated, distributed software development processes. The workshop activities aim to assess current research efforts in this area, identify results and directions that can increase the degree of automation, aid tool integration by building a common understanding, and increase the practical use of formal methods.</AbstractNarration>
