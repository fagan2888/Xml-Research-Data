    <AbstractNarration>Kan Wang, Principal Investigator, Iowa State University&lt;br/&gt;Stanton Gelvin, Co- Principal Investigator, Purdue University&lt;br/&gt;Heidi Kaeppler, Co- Principal Investigator, University of Wisconsin-Madison&lt;br/&gt;Bill Thompson, Co- Principal Investigator, North Carolina State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the Plant Genome Project matures, improved technologies for plant transformation are becoming essential. Given the rapid increase in genomic information and the need to understand the biological functions of numerous genes, it is essential to establish efficient transformation systems and make them available to researchers in the public sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Maize is the most studied model plant that has important economic value. Although genetic transformation systems for maize have been established in private laboratories, the lack of such systems is still a key limitation for public researchers. This is because most public research groups do not have access to the resources and infrastructure necessary for maize transformation by currently available procedures. In addition, the current technology has serious limitations, including low efficiency and throughput, difficulty with inbred line transformation, unpredictable transgene copy numbers and integrity, and undesirable transgene silencing during development and over generations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long term goal for this program is to conduct research aimed at establishing robust maize transformation technologies by: 1) developing a routine Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system, 2) enhancing transgene integration and expression, 3) investigating alternative transformation protocols using non-tissue culture approaches, and 4) expand transformation to more maize inbred lines. In addition, this program will facilitate transfer of improved protocols to the public sector by providing a more efficient transformation service, training research staff, and organizing transformation workshops.</AbstractNarration>
