    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0103888&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Han's proposal comprises of two research projects and an education project.&lt;br/&gt;In the first research project Han proposes to adapt recent techniques from&lt;br/&gt;geometric analysis to study certain geometrical and analytical problems in&lt;br/&gt;the evolution of vortex sheets in two dimensional Euler equations. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, the project proposes to study a possible notion of &lt;br/&gt;weak solution in terms of rectifiable varifolds, which, if successful,&lt;br/&gt;should provide more geometric description to the evolution of &lt;br/&gt;singular vortex sheet than the currently available notion of &lt;br/&gt;weak solution in terms of integrable vorticity functions.&lt;br/&gt;In some prototype situations, Han also proposes to study the more precise&lt;br/&gt;geometric behavior in the roll up of intersecting vortex sheets. &lt;br/&gt;In the second project, Han proposes to establish a &lt;br/&gt;value distribution theory for harmonic maps into negatively curved surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;Recent results in this area have suggested very rich geometric &lt;br/&gt;behavior of such harmonic maps in terms of induced foliation structures&lt;br/&gt;and tree-like structures in the vicinity of infinity.&lt;br/&gt;The geometric description of such behavior is closely related to&lt;br/&gt;the solvability of asymptotic boundary value problems of the relevant&lt;br/&gt;system of partial differential equations. The interaction of geometric analysis, &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, and their application to some interesting &lt;br/&gt;applied analysis problems is the thread connecting the two projects. &lt;br/&gt;In the education project, Han proposes to rejuvenate an undergraduate geometry course &lt;br/&gt;mostly for math education majors and an undergraduate differential geometry course &lt;br/&gt;to better serve the need of a wider audience that has grown out of &lt;br/&gt;today's rapidly changing technological environments&lt;br/&gt;and emergence of new interdisciplinary fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A good understanding of the evolution of concentrated vortices, such&lt;br/&gt;as vortex sheet, has immensely important practical values. &lt;br/&gt;The mathematical equations that govern the evolution of vortex sheets&lt;br/&gt;exhibit many features very similar to those that have been&lt;br/&gt;successfully studied in geometric analysis in recent years. The PI hopes&lt;br/&gt;that the interactions of ideas and tools from across the fields will&lt;br/&gt;bring some fruitful results in understanding better the geometric aspects&lt;br/&gt;of vortex sheet evolution. In his second project, the PI also hopes to&lt;br/&gt;combine closer the geometric and the analytic approaches, the success of which&lt;br/&gt;may provide further insight back to purely geometrical or analytical problems.&lt;br/&gt;The successful implementation of the third proposed project will &lt;br/&gt;will be a positive contribution to the K-12 math education through &lt;br/&gt;better training of math education majors.</AbstractNarration>
