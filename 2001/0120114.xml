    <AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Garth Bawden, Mr. Gregory Lockard will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Through archaeological excavation at the site of Galindo, located in the Moche Valley of northern coastal Peru, he will examine the processes which gave rise to the Chimu Empire. This, the largest coastal polity in South American prehistory encompassed, at its height two-thirds of all irrigated land along the Pacific desert coast. The empire was ruled by a small group of powerful elites who resided in the capital city of Chan Chan, also located in the Moche Valley. Chan Chan was founded ca. AD 1000 and over the next four and a half centuries Chan Chan elites directed the conquest of over 1000 km of Pacific coastline. Their power and territorial ambitions came to an end only after a long and bitter war with the Inka, who finally prevailed and conquered the Chimu Empire ca AD 1470. Archaeological evidence and ethnohistoric documents have revealed much concerning the political power of Chimu elites. The origins of this power however must be sought earlier and because Chimu elites emerged at Chan Chan in the Moche Valley, this area holds the key to understanding this development. Through excavation at Galindo, which was occupied immediately before and was a direct precursor to the Chimu, Mr. Lockard hopes to gain insight into this process. The site itself covers an area of approximately four square kilometers and a combination of physical and cultural features (walls and ditches) divide the site into at least six distinct zones. Survey of the site by Mr. Lockard has shown that architectural remains within each of these zones are relatively homogeneous and functionally differentiated from those of other areas of the site. Based on the method and quality of construction, surface area and artifactual content, they can be divided into low, moderate and high status residences and thus demonstrate that a hierarchical social structure existed at this time. Through a program of mapping and careful excavation to collect faunal and botanical remains, Mr. Lockard plans to reconstruct the Galindo social organization. It is quite likely that elites, at least in part, exercised power through the control of scarce goods and analysis of how food remains as well as other valuable materials are distributed should provide insight into this system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important for several reasons. Complex societies arose independently in many parts of the world and through multiple case comparison it is possible to determine the controlling factors which underlie this development. Prehistoric Peru provides one example and Mr. Lockard's work will help to fill a major gap. The data he collects will be of interest to many archaeologists and the project will help to train a promising young scientist.</AbstractNarration>
