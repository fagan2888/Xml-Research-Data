    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Looking Forward --Scaling Up the Digital Image Archive of Landscape Change&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is phase two of work begun under an earlier award. Geologic archives of landscape response to climate change and human impact (pond and alluvial fan sediments) are the subjects of this project. The first phase demonstrated the feasibility of the project, the high level of interest in the high school community, and the value of the resulting image bank to a variety of constituencies. Phase two of the pilot project continues to bridge gaps both between university research and high-school education and between history and science. The program connects high-school students and teachers, University of Vermont faculty, staff, and students, museum curators, town officials and librarians, and the Education Specialist for the Perkins Geology Museum at the University of Vermont. Townspeople work with each student to find at least two historic photographs clearly showing human/landscape interaction and assist the students as they attempt to relocate the place from which each photo was taken. Students and townspeople submit their work over the web using templates developed under this funding project.</AbstractNarration>
