    <AbstractNarration>The Summer Research Program in Biostatistics is offered by the Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The program will give undergraduate students the &lt;br/&gt;opportunity to explore a career in biostatistics and bioinformatics by working closely with faculty mentors in the Department and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Department has an internationally recognized research faculty committed to undergraduate and graduate training, who will direct individual research projects. Our goals are to spark the students' interest in biostatistical research and provide them with the tools and skills to successfully gain admission to post-baccalaureate programs. Students with strength in mathematics participate in coursework in statistical computing, biostatistics, and bioinformatics. A seminar series highlights the diversity of research areas utilizing biostatistics to solve real problems in biological and medical science and provides an understanding of the role of the statistician in a variety of scientific research areas. In addition the program includes workshops on ethics, career choices and other topics of interest.. There are a wide variety of biostatistics and bioinformtaics research activities for 6-8 students in the summer program. Research areas include clinical trials, epidemiology, bioinformatics, statistical genetics and laboratory experimental design. At the end of the 8 week period the students present their work on a chosen research topic to other program participants and mentors.</AbstractNarration>
