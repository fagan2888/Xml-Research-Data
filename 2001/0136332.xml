    <AbstractNarration>Small decision-making groups resolve many of the most important issues/questions in organizations and society. Such groups bring more resources than any single individual to the task at hand. There is also a fair amount of research support for the superior decision-making capabilities of groups as compared to individuals. However, recent work has shown that the same processes that make groups superior decision-makers and problem-solvers can under certain circumstances, lead them astray. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups perform better than individuals in many situations because when a correct or optimal alternative is proposed, groups have the ability to recognize the "correctness" of the alternative. Our recent work has shown that a group's ability to do this depends on an appropriate task representation shared by the group members. In most situations, the group members share an appropriate representation. However, we have shown that in situations where group members share a faulty task representation, group often perform worse than individuals. The research contained in the current proposal will attempt to further our understanding of how such shared task representations affect group decision-making. In addition, the research will address how competing shared representations - specifically representations at different levels of generality - affect group decision outcomes and processes. The overarching goals of the research are show how to enable groups to use appropriate task representations when they exist, but to learn how to prevent them from using faulty representations that are initially shared among the group members.</AbstractNarration>
