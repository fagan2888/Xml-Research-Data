    <AbstractNarration>This is a joint award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program in DMR and the Major Research Instrumentation program to Furman University. The award is for the acquisition of a scanning probe microscope for the characterization and manipulation of nanometer size materials. The study of materials in the nanometer regime is of fundamental importance to a host of emerging technologies. SPM is by far the most important tool for resolving nanometer size features of materials as well as for investigating material properties that are significant over that distance scale. The purchase of a Dimension 3001 SPM will allow Furman University to introduce the concepts central to nanoscience in various undergraduate courses as well as to enhance ongoing nanoscience research effort. Ongoing projects that will be directly impacted by this acquisition include: The characterization of nanostructures on the surfaces of electronically conducting polymers; Investigation of the formation and structure of nanoporous organic crystals and thin films; The design and operation of biosensors; The self-assembly of platinum complexes into monolayers; Dynamic studies of additive migration in polymer films, as well as several others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a joint award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program in DMR and the Major Research Instrumentation program to Furman University. The award is for the acquisition of a scanning probe microscope (SPM) for the characterization and manipulation of nanometer size materials. The announcement of the National Nanotechnology Initiative (www.nano.gov) illustrated the growing importance of nanometer-sized structures to the scientific and technological infrastructure of the United States. The SPM will enhance undergraduate education and research in the field of nanoscience. The instrument will be used both to expose students to the unique features of matter in this size regime and to investigate questions ranging from the interaction of molecules with DNA to the design of materials for optical computing. In addition to generating scientifically significant results, this instrument will be used to produce educational materials for the undergraduate educational community and to prepare students for graduate work in nanoscience and technology.</AbstractNarration>
