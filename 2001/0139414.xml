    <AbstractNarration>This project addresses the electrodynamics of complex solids using complimentary spectroscopic approaches to model organic conductors including low temperature, high magnetic field synchrotron based spectroscopy. Compounds of interest include prototypical superconducting, composites, and molecular ladder materials. Issues being addressed include chemical structure / physical property relationships, disorder, charge transfer characteristics in ladder compounds, and the microscopic characteristics of the high-field phase of low-dimensional superconductors. These projects will advance the training of high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students in areas of materials spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental understanding and development of new materials, and the development of advanced spectroscopic tools to probe new phenomena exhibited by superconducting and conducting organic solids, is a crucial area for emphasis in the training of materials scientists and engineers. Students with expertise in these materials science and engineering areas compete well in both the academic and industrial job markets.</AbstractNarration>
