    <AbstractNarration>This project involves revising the Middle Grades MATH Thematics curriculum, a comprehensive grades 6-8 mathematics curriculum developed with NSF funding from 1992 through 1997. Revisions will be informed by data collected from various stakeholders, including MATH Thematics teachers, research mathematicians and mathematics educators. Revised student materials will take advantage of new technologies and will be field tested in diverse middle-school settings. The professional development component of the curriculum will be greatly expanded. Materials for parents and administrators that are tailored to MATH Thematics will be developed. New materials will be designed that can be used with special learners, and existing multicultural materials will be evaluated and revised. Formative and summative evaluation of the project will be conducted. Cost sharing includes substantial contributions from the University of Montana and the publisher.</AbstractNarration>
