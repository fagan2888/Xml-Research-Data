    <AbstractNarration>DATE: January 8, 2001&lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NUMBER: OPP 0110244&lt;br/&gt;ORGANIZATION: Combustion Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;PI: Douglas Carpenter&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs operates up to six ski-equipped Lockheed LC-130 military cargo aircraft in Antarctica during the austral summer season, along with supplemental intercontinental flights of C-5, C-17, and C-141 aircraft. In addition, two ski-equipped utility deHavilland twin Otter (DHC-6) aircraft and four helicopters (Bell 212, AS 350's) fly intra-continental flights throughout the summer season. At present, hard-surface ice runways capable of supporting wheeled aircraft operations are available at McMurdo Station, with compacted snow ski-ways available at the other sites (as well as at McMurdo) Organized airfield rescue and fire fighting services are provided only at the airfields at McMurdo and at South Pole Stations. The NSF published a request for proposals to study all military and civilian guidelines for airfield rescue and fire fighting services and define the basic fire risks those standards have been established to address. In addition, the contract is established to study recent reports by noted authorities regarding airfield rescue and fire fighting service requirements at airports to ensure that all fire risks have been identified. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three companies bid on the proposal. Combustion Science and Engineering (CSE) of Columbia, Maryland was selected by the technical and business panels to be the award recipient at a fixed price of $99,600 for a level of effort of approximately six weeks. The effort will be led by Mr. Douglas Carpenter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has prior experience in Antarctica. The OPP Safety and Health Officer recommends this award be made at the fixed level of $99,600 effective 15 January 2001 for a period not to exceed six months.</AbstractNarration>
