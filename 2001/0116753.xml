    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funds for the purchase of high speed digital imaging systems and fast processing hardware along with a droplet deposition platform, and a robotic Gas Metal Arc welder. This equipment will be used to build advanced vision based sensing capabilities that can be applied to arc welding and droplet-based manufacturing processes. These processes are intimately related, as they both involve the transfer of droplets of molten material to a work piece, although the particular method of delivery is different.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This equipment will allow high-speed imaging of droplets and weld pools, with the goal of tight control of the solidification process. Because droplet processing can play a key role in advanced manufacturing processes, including net-shape manufacturing and rapid prototyping, the sensing and control of these processes will be critical. Several aspects of vision based control will be explored. For example, by extracting the dynamic behavior of the droplet deposition process and utilizing models of droplet transfer and solidification, control of the material micro-structure is possible. Similarly, dynamic imaging of the weld pool will enable the determination, and thus control, of weld quality in real time. Vision-based control of welding and droplet manufacturing processes encompasses several different theoretical areas, including fluid dynamics, heat transfer, computer vision, control systems, and robotics. This instrumentation will thus strengthen the interdisciplinary connections within the Engineering Division at the Colorado School of Mines, as well as across campus.</AbstractNarration>
