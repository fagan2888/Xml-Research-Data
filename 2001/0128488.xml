    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves development of fully inorganic nanofiltration (NF) membrane modules that combine the attributes of low cost, excellent chemical resistance in aggressive organic and aqueous media, high thermal stability, and high mechanical strength. The key objectives will be to develop NF membrane modules based on low-cost multi-channel honeycomb supports with 220 square cetimeter membrane area and to demonstrate they have NF retention capability, high productivity (flux rates), and resistance to aggressive organic and aqueous media. Preliminary work to fabricate analogous modules with 1200 square centimeter membrane area will be performed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modules, when ultimately commercialized to very large size, will be especially suitable for in-process recycling of solvents used in a wide variety of applications and could replace distillation as a cost-effective purification method for solvents such as hexane and acetone that are used in very large quantities in edible oil processing. In addition, the products would have wide application in the chemical manufacturing, petrochemical, petroleum production, pharmaceutical, food processing, and water treatment industries.</AbstractNarration>
