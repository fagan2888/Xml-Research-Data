    <AbstractNarration>0134424 Montas The overall objective of the proposed project is to develop an excellent, unified and integrated program of research and teaching in engineering computation applied to biological resources systems. The proposed study consists of two educational components and three research components aimed at achieving this goal. The educational objectives are to: 1) Develop an undergraduate electronic textbook on engineering computation in biological resources, and; 2) Integrate stochastic theory, wavelet analysis and decision support into graduate level course contents and electronic documents. &lt;br/&gt;Research objectives are to: 1) Develop the stochastic-continuum theory of biotransport processes and validate it across biological resources systems; 2) Assess the ability of wavelet-stochastic techniques to classify biological resource image data; 3) Develop and evaluate decision support applications in biological resources areas. Successful completion of this project is expected to contribute significantly to engineering knowledge and to excellent teaching of engineering computation applied to biological resources at undergraduate and graduate levels.***</AbstractNarration>
