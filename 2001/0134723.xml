    <AbstractNarration>At the heart of the genomics revolution has been the democratization of genome projects of all varieties - EST sequencing, large-scale mapping, and both limited and complete genome sequencing projects. This has resulted in the production of large, associated datasets of diverse types that are often scattered in space, time, and format. This has made comparative analyses difficult and makes the creation of integrated databases a significant, if not often insurmountable challenge. The goal will be to discuss and to attempt to define what is meant by accessible, timely, and usable data and how NSF and USDA can help to facilitate such data coordination for plant genome data. The objective is to define the design elements that will ensure modular, extensible, interoperable, machine and human queryable data structures and interfaces.</AbstractNarration>
