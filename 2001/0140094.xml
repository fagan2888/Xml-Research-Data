    <AbstractNarration>Research will be conducted into models of diffusion-limited reactions and&lt;br/&gt;the method of empty intervals which we introduced originally for the &lt;br/&gt;treatment of coalescence, A + A -&gt; A. We have extended the method of &lt;br/&gt;intervals to annihilation, A + A -&gt; 0, the branching- and double &lt;br/&gt;branching-annihilating process, and the q-state Potts model in the T=0 limit. &lt;br/&gt;The method yields detailed information: we derived explicit expressions for &lt;br/&gt;the n-point correlation functions of coalescence and annihilation, for all n.&lt;br/&gt;Different research groups have recently adopted the method of intervals for &lt;br/&gt;the analysis of models not amenable to the complementary method of free&lt;br/&gt;Majorana fermions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted into several abstract open questions, including&lt;br/&gt;the kinetics of reactions with anomalous, subdiffusive transport; exactly &lt;br/&gt;solvable models of nonuniversal kinetic phase transitions; and the shielding &lt;br/&gt;effect in coalescence, as a basis for more exact solutions and for novel &lt;br/&gt;approximation methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted also into a number of practical questions motivated &lt;br/&gt;by our work so far. These include: (1) A new method, due to Fokas, for&lt;br/&gt;solving PDEs in convex domains with arbitrary boundary conditions; (2) Speedy &lt;br/&gt;computer algorithms for the simulation of reaction-diffusion systems; &lt;br/&gt;(3) Stability of networks, such as the Internet, in the face of random failure &lt;br/&gt;or a coordinated attack; (4) Mechanisms of signal transduction in eukaryotic &lt;br/&gt;cells; and (5) Statistical physics interpretation of various experiments in &lt;br/&gt;contemporary chemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is particularly well-suited for educational purposes. One student &lt;br/&gt;has completed a M.Sc. in physics and another is graduating with a Ph.D.&lt;br/&gt;degree. Several undergraduate students have already been involved (mainly with &lt;br/&gt;computer simulations), and their effort has resulted in at least three&lt;br/&gt;publications in refereed journals. We forsee many more opportunities for &lt;br/&gt;students involvement.</AbstractNarration>
