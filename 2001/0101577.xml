    <AbstractNarration>The Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS) is adapting and implementing curricular materials and best practices from South Carolina's ATE Center of Excellence in order to increase enrollment, retention, diversity, and success rate of technology students. The goals of this project are: to develop a technology "portal" (i.e., a pre-technology curriculum) to serve under-prepared students desiring to enter a number of technology-related programs (not only Engineering Technology but Industrial and Engineering Technology, Applied Process Technologies, Industrial Chemical Technology, Information Technology and other related Technology Programs); to adapt the SC ATE Engineering Technology Freshman Year Core to accommodate the needs of KCTCS' Industrial &amp; Engineering Technology program; to develop the faculty expertise to design and implement an integrated curriculum at both the portal and freshman levels; and to design and implement an integrated curriculum that will enhance students' basic skills in mathematics, communications, English, and physics, utilizing applied methodology in a technology environment. Key business and industry partners across the state are collaborating with faculty in curriculum design, and business and industry advisory committees at each pilot college are reviewing proposed curricula. All curricula are encompassing the skills identified in the SCANS report. The Kentucky model is adapting modules developed by the SC ATE and is using South Carolina's practices to create additional modules to meet the needs of the Commonwealth. As a result of this project, it is envisioned that a more diverse population will enroll in technology courses, remediation time will be shortened, students will be better prepared to enter the workforce and/or baccalaureate programs, and participants (faculty and students) will connect the required general education components more directly to the technological field in which they are teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>
