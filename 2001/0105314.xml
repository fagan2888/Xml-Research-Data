    <AbstractNarration>The discrete spectrum of the Laplacian on the &lt;br/&gt;modular surface and the associated eigenfunctions &lt;br/&gt;(called Maass wave forms) are an interesting and basic &lt;br/&gt;class of functions which nevertheless remain mysteriously &lt;br/&gt;elusive fifty years after their discovery. While numerical &lt;br/&gt;approximations exist, concrete analytic information is &lt;br/&gt;somewhat scarce; in particular, at present no explicit &lt;br/&gt;constructions exist for any of these eigenfunctions. These &lt;br/&gt;mathematical objects are of interest in such seemingly &lt;br/&gt;diverse fields as number theory in mathematics and dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems, statistical mechanics, and quantum chaos in &lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics. The starting point for this project is&lt;br/&gt;a new class of functions equivalent to the Maass forms, called &lt;br/&gt;period functions in analogy with the period polynomials &lt;br/&gt;associated to the classical modular forms of integral weight. &lt;br/&gt;These functions, discovered by the investigator and developed &lt;br/&gt;individually and more recently in collaboration with D. Zagier, &lt;br/&gt;are holomorphic and satisfy a simple functional equation, and &lt;br/&gt;so appear to be simpler class of mathematical objects than the &lt;br/&gt;Maass forms themselves. For this reason, and because the &lt;br/&gt;development of their algebraic structure leads in a number of &lt;br/&gt;different interrelated and intriguing directions, they show &lt;br/&gt;promise to continue to shed new light on this basic problem. &lt;br/&gt;Their further development and the extension of these results &lt;br/&gt;to general subgroups, using representation theory and cohomology &lt;br/&gt;of groups, are the main goals of this project. In addition, &lt;br/&gt;connections between period functions and certain equations which &lt;br/&gt;arise both in the study of transfer operators for dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems and in the study of spin-chain partition functions in &lt;br/&gt;statistical mechanics are already under study by several &lt;br/&gt;researchers, including one working group in Germany which &lt;br/&gt;is specifically investigating these questions. The applications &lt;br/&gt;of Maass period functions to these related areas of theoretical &lt;br/&gt;physics is thus also a focus of this work, to be pursued including &lt;br/&gt;discussions with researchers working on these problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Research in mathematics and related theoretical physics will &lt;br/&gt;use methods developed by the investigator and his colleagues to &lt;br/&gt;gain more concrete and explicit information about Maass wave forms. &lt;br/&gt;These functions are one type in a class called "modular forms" &lt;br/&gt;which has many applications in such diverse fields as number theory, &lt;br/&gt;physics, and cryptography (or code making and breaking). Maass wave &lt;br/&gt;forms in particular are the non-Euclidean version of the sine waves &lt;br/&gt;(or pure tones - the wave form produced by striking a tuning fork) &lt;br/&gt;in ordinary space, which are the basic components out of which all &lt;br/&gt;shapes are built. The study of geometry and physics in this non-&lt;br/&gt;Euclidean "parallel universe" has provided science with a rich source &lt;br/&gt;of new ideas, as well as a contrasting proving ground on which to &lt;br/&gt;sharpen ideas in the geometry and physics of the space we live in. &lt;br/&gt;For example, the study of the behavior of Maass forms provides very &lt;br/&gt;useful insights in the quest to gain a deeper understanding of the &lt;br/&gt;conditions under which a physical system will exhibit regular or &lt;br/&gt;chaotic behavior, an important and pervasive question in physics. &lt;br/&gt;Maass forms have proven mysteriously hard to construct explicitly, &lt;br/&gt;and continue to be under active investigation fifty years after &lt;br/&gt;their discovery.</AbstractNarration>
