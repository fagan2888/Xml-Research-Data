    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the acquisition of an Agilent UV/VIS spectrophotometer equipped with LabVIEW software, we are introducing chemical kinetics and computer data analysis in our introductory chemistry course and in environmental management technology program. Most of our students in this associate degree program enter the workforce upon graduation and become involved in environmental testing and chemical analyses in a laboratory setting. Our goal is to better prepare students to meet these challenges by adapting and implementing computer-aided laboratory experiments into our curriculum. These experiments allow students to integrate and reinforce chemical concepts learned in the classroom with real-life experiences. Kinetics is a difficult concept for students to grasp and often requires exploring the topic through various modalities. We are using our UV/VIS to do kinetics experiments in which the students visually track changes in chemical reactions in real time.</AbstractNarration>
