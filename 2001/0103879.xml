    <AbstractNarration>Prop: AST-0103879&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dyer, Kristy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Dyer is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro. She will study the nonthermal emission in supernova remnants as a way to understand shock physics and the origin of cosmic rays. Her research plan involves using the low frequency receivers at the Very Large Array and unblocked aperture of the Green Bank Telescope to remove flux uncertainties in order to test predications made by shock acceleration theory. She will also look for a missing population of very young galactic supernova remnants by carrying out a high resolution study of bright, compact SNR's selected from recent surveys. And lastly, she will make higher resolution radio observations of extragalactic supernova remnants in order to extend the sample of known supernova remnants. In her educational activities, she will contribute to NRAO's outreach program by planning and conducting several Chautauqua courses, intensive workshops for undergraduate college faculty, and by participating in the development and implementation of NRAO's programs for the underserved community in the local public schools.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
