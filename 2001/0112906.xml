    <AbstractNarration>In recent years, auction theory has been asked to provide guidance to&lt;br/&gt;policymakers in several important areas, including spectrum auctions,&lt;br/&gt;electricity auctions, and Treasury auctions. Unfortunately, the received&lt;br/&gt;theory had largely focused on auctions of a single object, and so had little&lt;br/&gt;to rigorously say about the most empirically relevant auction problems.&lt;br/&gt;Recent research by economists has begun to expand the boundaries of auction&lt;br/&gt;theory and analysis so as to encompass multiple-item auctions. In prior&lt;br/&gt;work, we have analyzed the theoretical properties of existing multiple-item&lt;br/&gt;auction formats, proposed new efficient auction formats for multiple items,&lt;br/&gt;proposed new applications for multiple-item auctions, and empirically&lt;br/&gt;evaluated recent applications of auctions for spectrum and electricity. This&lt;br/&gt;project builds upon this recent work, by examining the following topics:&lt;br/&gt;* Development of the properties of a new, efficient ascending auction for&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous commodities.&lt;br/&gt;* Understanding the theoretical underpinnings for efficient ascending&lt;br/&gt;auctions.&lt;br/&gt;* Analysis of auctions for heterogeneous commodities in environments with&lt;br/&gt;interdependent values.&lt;br/&gt;* Study of auction theory with agency problems.&lt;br/&gt;* Use of the reserve price in mitigating the exercise of market power.&lt;br/&gt;* New applications for multiple-item auction designs.&lt;br/&gt;* Empirical analysis of the European 3G spectrum auctions.&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a balance between further theoretical developments of&lt;br/&gt;multiple-item auctions, and practical applications and empirical testing of&lt;br/&gt;the ideas of auction theory.</AbstractNarration>
