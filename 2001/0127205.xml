    <AbstractNarration>Faculty at Wright State University and Miami University are conducting complementary activities for the purpose of introducing and training students and educators to the precepts and techniques of combinatorial chemistry. The primary focus of the project is laboratory instruction in this area. Activities include testing, adapting and documenting experiments already developed at the collaborating institutions as well as developing additional exercises appropriate for students at all levels of undergraduate training. The materials take into consideration variations in equipment inventory and faculty expertise at institutions serving as adaptation sites. The utility of these experiments as an educational contribution to the training of chemical technicians is also being explored. Experiments range from solid phase variants of traditional experiments to discovery-based activities requiring group work and several weeks of project-style input. Anticipated dissemination activities include publication and presentation of papers at professional conferences, the development of sourcebooks and workshops for educators, dedicated conferences and collaboration on an introductory laboratory manual.</AbstractNarration>
