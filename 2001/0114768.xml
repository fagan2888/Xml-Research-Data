    <AbstractNarration>This project will analyze how algebraic concepts and representations are developed and introduced throughout the Chinese, Singaporean, and United States curricula for Grades K-8. Recent international assessments indicate that the level of achievement in algebra is quite different in the three countries, and this project will analyze how the differences in achievement are related to differences in curricula. Case studies of the Chinese and Singaporean curricula, as well as selected US curricula (including NSF-funded programs and others), will help explain these differences and provide guidance to curriculum developers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be conducted in parallel with the comparative study organized by the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) entitled "Mathematics Education in Different Cultural Traditions: A Comparative Study of East Asia and the West." The ICMI study provides a broader mathematical context for the more specific work of this project on the algebra curriculum. It also provides a pool of international experts in the field who can advise this project and additional opportunities for dissemination. The results of the project will be used to improve the development of K-8 mathematics curricula in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
