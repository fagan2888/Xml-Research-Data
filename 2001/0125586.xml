    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21) This project is adapting and implementing the WeBWork homework "delivery" and grading system to help improve the success of students in College Algebra. The project builds on the successful use of WeBWorK to increase homework activity of students in calculus classes in several institutions. This project is now extending the use of the system to a large service class, College Algebra, with a total enrollment of 720 students each academic year at the PI's institution. The collection of problem sets created using the PG (problem generator) programming language developed for WeBWorK is being shared with other WeBWorK authors for distribution. In addition, training workshops are being conducted for an average of eight faculty per semester who are using WeBWorK directly in College Algebra classes. During the final year of the project, faculty from area high schools, community colleges and other institutions of higher education are to take part in training sessions with WeBWorK and to share information about its effectiveness.</AbstractNarration>
