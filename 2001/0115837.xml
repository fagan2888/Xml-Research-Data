    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Dupras and colleagues at the University of Central Florida to acquire an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). This instrument is a specialized class of mass spectrometer designed to measure, with high precision, small differences in natural abundances of the light stable isotopes (non-radioactive types of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen). The primary application for this instrument is to measure naturally occurring stable isotope ratios in tissues of plants, humans, and other animals. In recent years, these stable isotopes have become essential tools in investigations in physical anthropology, archaeology, ecology, and conservation biology. Stable-isotope analysis is especially valuable in reconstructing diets since the isotope ratios in animal tissues reflect the isotope ratios of the foods consumed. Estimating the diets of humans and other animals with this type of instrumentation allows investigators to reconstruct environments, examine patterns of health, determine differential use of alternative foods, and detect patterns of migration.&lt;br/&gt; The research activities planned for this instrumentation include projects in several disciplines. The specific activities in anthropology and archaeology include: reconstructing the diet of past inhabitants of the Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt, in order to understand human bio-cultural adaptation to the harsh Saharan ecozone; determining differences and changes in diet among the inhabitants of ancient Maya sites, such as Caracol, Belize; and, analyzing patterns of prehistoric human migration. The research in ecology and conservation biology include: investigating predator-prey interactions, feeding relationships, and energy flow in the small mammal communities of coastal Florida; determining current and historical diet of Canada lynx across their range for use in developing conservation strategies for this endangered species; and, tracing the source of the diet of Florida manatees to determine feeding habits, as well as the historical foraging strategies, of this endangered marine mammal.&lt;br/&gt; This grant is a cooperative effort by faculty in several different disciplines to acquire basic equipment that has become integral to their fields. Recent advances in technology (decreasing the time and cost of analysis) and an increased recognition of the utility of stable-isotope ratios have promoted a dramatic increase in the use of this technique to reconstruct diets and trace the flow of energy and nutrients in ecological communities. The purchase of an IRMS for researchers at the University of Central Florida will speed the process of scientific inquiry on already existing scientific collections, and will enhance interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary scholarship. The IRMS will also have implications for undergraduate and graduate education at UCF. Use of the IMS in multi-disciplinary lab techniques courses will provide practical, hands-on experience for graduate students and advanced undergraduates; students trained in stable isotope analysis will have valuable expertise in this rapidly expanding field. Thus, the acquisition of an IRMS also will strengthen the connections between teaching, learning, and research at UCF.</AbstractNarration>
