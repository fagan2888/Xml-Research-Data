    <AbstractNarration>The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this renewal award to Colorado State University to develop new electrochemically-active metal-centered polymer materials based on transition metal complexes of diimine ligands. With this award, Professor Elliott will functionalize ligands to polymerize them and to fine-tune their redox properties. Polymer films of single and multi-layer/multi-composition structures will be prepared and studied to control counterion motion both within polymer phases and across their boundaries and to control the oxidation-state distribution of redox sites. Determination of the differences and similarities between electroluminescence and electro-generated chemiluminescence, and potential application of these polymers in organic light emitting diodes will also be studied with this award. In addition, training in materials chemistry will be provided to a diversity of students with this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New electrochemically-active materials with transition metals in the center will be prepared using functionalized ligands based on diimines. Polymer films will be prepared to control counterion motion both within polymer phases and across their boundaries and to control the oxidation-state distribution of redox sites. These dendrimeric polymers with controlled oxidation-reduction properties will have applications in catalysis, phase transfer reactions, drug delivery systems and sensors. Determination of the differences and similarities between electroluminescence and electro-generated chemiluminescence would provide insight into potential applications of these polymers in organic light emitting diodes. In addition, the award would expose both graduate and undergraduate students in different aspects of experimental materials chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
