    <AbstractNarration>PROJECT SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) was awarded funds for the acquisition of state-of-the-art equipment and associated instrumentation to increase access and promote research, research training, and integrated research/education activities primarily in the area of civil infrastructure engineering. UMR has identified civil infrastructure engineering as one of six areas for development under the 'Mission Enhancement Program' of the University of Missouri System. The awarded equipment will support activities that are in line with the research and educational goals of the University and the National Science Foundation/Major Research Instrumentation (NSF/MRI) program goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new state-of-the-art structural engineering research/education laboratory has just been completed in the Civil Engineering Department at UMR. With this brand new facility in place and in combination with the awarded equipment, UMR will be in the position to offer experimental facilities to its faculty, graduate and undergraduate students and to carry out significant research and education activities that address the nation's needs. In addition, cooperative research and development activities with government agencies and private industries will result in the advancement and implementation of scientific knowledge that is required for the safety of state and national civil engineering infrastructures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The equipment and instrumentation awarded in this proposal consists of: (1) three hydraulic actuators with servo-controlled valves capable of static, fatigue, dynamic and high-velocity testing; (2) hydraulic service manifolds and hydraulic power pump; (3) electronic control system; and, (4) high-capacity data acquisition system unit. UMR faculty members are actively pursuing research/education activities at the national and international levels that address some of the world's needs for the development of modern design and repair methodologies for civil infrastructures. These research/education activities demand equipment capabilities that far exceed current levels in the state of Missouri and/or at nearby regional universities. Additionally, the newly constructed and equipped laboratory will allow UMR and its centers of excellence in attracting significant corporate and government research funding and draw a larger number of graduate and undergraduate students to pursue careers in engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new state-of-the-art structural engineering research/education laboratory will benefit students and faculty in the Civil Engineering Department as well as students and faculty from other academic departments such as Aerospace Engineering, Engineering Mechanics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Mining Engineering. Faculty in these departments are actively pursuing and conducting interdisciplinary research projects and have been successful in obtaining the support of private industry as well as state and federal agencies. The primary areas of research, research training, and educational activities that will be supported by the proposed equipment are: (i) structural testing of components and subassemblies; (ii) earthquake engineering and intelligent control of smart structures; (iii) use of advanced materials and FRP composites in construction; (iv) repair and rehabilitation of structural components in aging aircraft; (v) behavior of cold-formed steel structures; and, (vi) behavior of reinforced/prestressed concrete structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will enable UMR to address the following University and NSF/MRI program goals: (1) strengthen and expand existing experimental research, research training, and education activities and facilities; (2) increase the population of women and under-represented minority groups in the university's graduate and undergraduate programs through access to and use of state-of-the-art research/education equipment; (3) expand university-wide integrated interdisciplinary research and education activities; and, (4) build and strengthen industrial contacts and partnerships to promote and increase the scope of research, research training, and education opportunities available nationally as well as in the state of Missouri.</AbstractNarration>
