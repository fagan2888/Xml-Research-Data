    <AbstractNarration>Despite numerous studies, it is still unclear how biodiversity affects ecosystem function. This research will evaluate whether interspecific effects overshadow intraspecific variation in influencing ecosystem dynamics. A field experiment being conducted as part of this dissertation has found that genetic makeup of leaf litter affected components of the carbon and nitrogen cycles by influencing tannin content, decomposition rate, and nitrogen content. Low genetic diversity yielded idiosyncratic nutrient cycles that differed significantly from high diversity treatments. While this project is unique in its focus on intraspecific, and not interspecific diversity, the implications need to be considered in relation to interspecific diversity. Specifically, will the effects of decreased intraspecific diversity be masked by the addition of a single commonly co-occurring species? To answer this, the PIs propose to replicate field experiments in the lab with and without the addition of naturally co-occurring pine litter. By comparing carbon and nitrogen dynamics of oak litter with and without pine litter, the PIs will be able to assess the effects of additional species in the community on the ecosystem-level consequences of reduced intraspecific genetic diversity</AbstractNarration>
