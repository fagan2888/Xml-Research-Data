    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to lay the foundation for a QoS metric that can be easily &lt;br/&gt;understood and can be used for the design of future packet networks. The premise of the &lt;br/&gt;proposed research is that Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms have not been widely &lt;br/&gt;employed because of both their complexity and their lack of relationship to user &lt;br/&gt;perceived performance. Therefore, it is currently difficult to justify the investment in &lt;br/&gt;complex QoS technologies while their value to the end customer is unknown. There have &lt;br/&gt;been cases where commercial networks have been over provisioned, resulting in all users, &lt;br/&gt;independent of QoS requirement or priority, receiving the same service. Based on these &lt;br/&gt;experiences network customers are reluctant to pay extra for QoS. &lt;br/&gt;Historically, the telephony QoS metric, call blocking probability, was not only &lt;br/&gt;easily understood but provided the foundation for network design. Clearly this metric is &lt;br/&gt;not suitable for packet networks like the Internet, since packet networks experience delay &lt;br/&gt;and packet loss in the presence of congestion. Recently, it has become increasingly &lt;br/&gt;apparent that temporal characteristics of the congestion episodes have the dominant effect &lt;br/&gt;on user perceived QoS. Reinforcing the increasing importance of the temporal &lt;br/&gt;characteristics of congestion is the recent work in the Internet Engineering Task Force &lt;br/&gt;(IETF) on measurement-based temporal QoS metrics. Once congestion occurs at a &lt;br/&gt;bottleneck point in the network it tends to persist and cause a user observable &lt;br/&gt;impairment. Thus, there is a need to increase our understanding of the temporal &lt;br/&gt;characteristics of congestion. To address this issue a new QoS metric is defined, the rate &lt;br/&gt;of congestion events per unit time, and a research effort identified to develop analytic &lt;br/&gt;methodologies to study this QoS metric. Specifically, this research will focus on: 1) &lt;br/&gt;predicting the frequency of congestion events for long range dependent (LDR) like &lt;br/&gt;traffic, i.e., fractional Brownian motion, in a network context, 2) developing simple &lt;br/&gt;approximations for predicting the frequency of congestion events, 3) validating the &lt;br/&gt;resulting prediction methodologies for networks using real high resolution traffic &lt;br/&gt;measurements, 4) developing efficient techniques to measure the rate of congestion &lt;br/&gt;events, and 5) relating the congestion event metric proposed here to new measurement-&lt;br/&gt;based temporal QoS metrics. A rigorous definition is proposed for the time between &lt;br/&gt;congestion episodes, which leads to the application of first hitting time analysis for its &lt;br/&gt;prediction. The proposed research will exploit some recent theoretical results as well &lt;br/&gt;develop new methods for predicting first hitting times for a realistic traffic. &lt;br/&gt;Network users have been struggling to quantify their perceived performance. The &lt;br/&gt;new QoS metric proposed here summarizes the network component of performance in &lt;br/&gt;one easily understandable number. Equally important, the proposed metric is structured &lt;br/&gt;in such a way that it can be used for network engineering. We expect the proposed &lt;br/&gt;metric, combined with accurate prediction techniques, will play an important role in &lt;br/&gt;designing future packet networks.</AbstractNarration>
