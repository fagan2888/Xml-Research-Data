    <AbstractNarration>This project supports undergraduate students in computer science&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics through scholarships, mentoring, internships, research experience,&lt;br/&gt;conference participation and other activities. The project provides four scholarships each&lt;br/&gt;academic year: two for lower division students, and two for upper division students.&lt;br/&gt;Scholarships are awarded to students with demonstrated financial need on the basis of&lt;br/&gt;academic record, professional promise, and character.&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients are encouraged to take advantage of various opportunities in the Math and Computer Science Departments that will be enhanced by this project. Students obtain professional training through internship programs with local high technology companies, participation in research with faculty members, and attendance at seminars and professional meetings. Scholars receive support and mentoring by faculty, and are provided additional activities and mentoring opportunities specially designed to meet the needs of female students. Leadership skills are developed through community service, teaching assignments (both within the Department and in the local area), and administration of the annual mathematics contest for high school students. Scholarship recipients are expected to take leadership roles in community-building activities sponsored by the Department.</AbstractNarration>
