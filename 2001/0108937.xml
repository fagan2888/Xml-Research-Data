    <AbstractNarration>A program of laboratory experiments in gravitation is to be continued and expanded, in parallel with continued development of the cryogenic torsion pendulum as a general tool for research in gravitational physics. Much of this work will be done in collaboration with the gravitational physics group of Professor Paul Boynton at the University of Washington. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research to be conducted includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Completion in the first year of a precision measurement of the gravitational constant G, with&lt;br/&gt;target accuracy of 15 ppm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jointly with Professor Boynton's group, a test of the inverse square distance dependence of the gravitational force for mass separation on the order of 15 centimeters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jointly with Boynton's group, tests of the equivalence principle over various distance ranges,&lt;br/&gt;for gravitational field sources which include laboratory masses, a nearby mountain, and the&lt;br/&gt;sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These projects will be conducted in an underground laboratory that has been prepared with support from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in a former Nike missile bunker on an isolated environmental preserve near&lt;br/&gt;Richland, Washington. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In conjunction with these projects, the performance of the cryogenic torsion&lt;br/&gt;pendulum will be progressively improved through development and refinement of seismic isolation, tilt control, temperature control, and fiber choice and preparation techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The cryogenic torsion pendulum being developed is of potential value to any research in gravitation or other fields which requires the measurement of extremely small slowly varying forces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides research experience and training in a variety of widely applicable technologies, to undergraduate and graduate students as well as to a postdoctoral researcher.</AbstractNarration>
