    <AbstractNarration>This research program explores quantum dynamical processes for individual atoms strongly coupled to the field of an optical cavity. The scientific objectives of the proposed research include investigations of atomic kinetics in a quantized light field and of the resulting entanglement between atomic motion and the optical field. The specific setting for the research is that of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) in a domain of strong coupling whereby single atoms and photons can profoundly impact the evolution of the composite system.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research builds upon the previously realized "atom-cavity microscope" for tracking the motion of individual atoms bound in orbit by single photons inside a high-quality optical resonator. The strong interaction of atom and cavity field allows atomic motion to be sensed in real time at the quantum limits, thereby enabling the implementation of quantum feedback to control atomic motion within the resonator. The proposed program of research investigates the operating principles for such "quantum servos ", including probing the quantum limits for observation and control of the microscopic quantum world. The goal is the coherent manipulation of quantum motion in ways that are not possible using ordinary feedback control. Although the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is principally experimental, a supporting theoretical effort is also to be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;Within a more general context, the significance of the research program lies in its attempt to exploit the atom-cavity system as a paradigm for the investigation of quantum dynamical processes for open quantum systems in a regime of strong coupling. Cavity QED with strong coupling propels optical physics well beyond traditional nonlinear optics and laser physics into a new regime with dynamical processes now involving atoms and photons taken one by one. By developing qualitatively new technical capabilities in optical physics, the research addresses fundamental issues related to the advancement of quantum information science and technology.</AbstractNarration>
