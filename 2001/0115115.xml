    <AbstractNarration>One of 28 national alliances, CAMP is entering the ninth year of a ten-year cooperative&lt;br/&gt;agreement between the National Science Foundation and UC Irvine, the lead campus and&lt;br/&gt;administrative center. The primary numerical goal is to double the number of B.S. degrees&lt;br/&gt;granted to underrepresented students in SMET (science, mathematics, engineering, technology)&lt;br/&gt;majors at the University of California. Offered at the eight general UC campuses, CAMP has&lt;br/&gt;created a systemwide network of faculty, program staff and students working toward a common&lt;br/&gt;set of measured outcomes. Goals include completion of the B.S. degree, preparation for and&lt;br/&gt;transition to graduate school or the professional workplace. The program serves undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;through enrichment opportunities and faculty mentored research supported by stipends. This&lt;br/&gt;effort has contributed to a 78% increase in B.S. degrees granted by UC from the baseline year&lt;br/&gt;(1990-91). Activities center on faculty mentored research experiences, collaborative learning,&lt;br/&gt;presenting at scientific conferences, science writing and co-authorship, technology literacy, and&lt;br/&gt;preparation for graduate school. Student achievement is disseminated through the Quarterly and&lt;br/&gt;on-line, www.camp.uci.edu. A permanent allocation through the UC Regents Diversity&lt;br/&gt;Initiative supports program infrastructure, administration, and expansion. Using a synergistic&lt;br/&gt;approach, the California Alliance collaborates with affiliated initiatives such as UC LEADS and&lt;br/&gt;AGEP (Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate) that enhance baccalaureate degree&lt;br/&gt;completion and continuation to advanced study. Responding to the paucity of minorities in&lt;br/&gt;faculty positions in the university and nationwide, special emphasis is being placed on&lt;br/&gt;encouraging students to prepare for a career in academia, and entering the professoriate. The&lt;br/&gt;CAMP mission: Scientists and engineers are best prepared by other scientists and engineers who&lt;br/&gt;exhibit and expect scholarly excellence.</AbstractNarration>
