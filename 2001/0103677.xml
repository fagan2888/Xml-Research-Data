    <AbstractNarration>Thomas G. Leness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this proposal, to be done in collaboration &lt;br/&gt;with P. Feehan, are to prove Witten's conjecture relating &lt;br/&gt;the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants of smooth &lt;br/&gt;four-manifolds, to understand the relation between&lt;br/&gt;the conditions of Seiberg-Witten simple type and &lt;br/&gt;Kronheimer-Mrowka simple type, and to search for possible &lt;br/&gt;topological constraints on these invariants. This work &lt;br/&gt;will be carried out by exploring the moduli space of PU(2) &lt;br/&gt;monopoles which contains a moduli space of anti-self-dual &lt;br/&gt;connections and the moduli spaces of Seiberg-Witten &lt;br/&gt;monopoles for certain Spin C structures. This implies &lt;br/&gt;that the Donaldson invariant can be expressed as a sum, &lt;br/&gt;over these spinc structures, of an expression given by &lt;br/&gt;pairing certain cohomology classes with the link of the &lt;br/&gt;moduli space of Seiberg-Witten monopoles in the Uhlenbeck compactification of the moduli space of PU(2) monopoles.&lt;br/&gt;The first phase of this work is to complete the proof &lt;br/&gt;that the pairing of these cohomology classes with the &lt;br/&gt;link of the moduli space of Seiberg-Witten monopoles can &lt;br/&gt;be expressed in a universal form depending only on the &lt;br/&gt;Seiberg-Witten invariant and the homotopy type of the &lt;br/&gt;manifold. This work will also yield a proof of the &lt;br/&gt;Kotschick-Morgan conjecture on wall-crossing formulas &lt;br/&gt;for Donaldson invariants. The second phase of this work &lt;br/&gt;is to calculate this universal form in sufficient detail &lt;br/&gt;to allow the computation of the explicit relation between &lt;br/&gt;the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten invariants. We intend to &lt;br/&gt;do this calculation by using known surgery formulas for&lt;br/&gt;both invariants (e.g. blow-up formulas), examples where &lt;br/&gt;both invariants are known, and some internal symmetries &lt;br/&gt;of the sum mentioned above. It is possible that this &lt;br/&gt;relation between the Donaldson and Seiberg-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants is over-determined and thus will reveal &lt;br/&gt;constraints on these invariants given by the topological &lt;br/&gt;type of the four-manifold, as was done in earlier work &lt;br/&gt;with Kronheimer and Mrowka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An n-dimensional manifold is a topological space that &lt;br/&gt;locally looks like n-dimensional Euclidean space. &lt;br/&gt;Manifolds are important objects to study because they &lt;br/&gt;are ubiquitous: the solution set of k equations in&lt;br/&gt;n variables will usually be an (n-k)-dimensional manifold. &lt;br/&gt;The main tools for distinguishing between four-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;manifolds are the Seiberg-Witten and Donaldson invariants. &lt;br/&gt;Thus, understanding the relation between these invariants&lt;br/&gt;is crucial to an understanding of four-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology. In addition, the conjectures relating these &lt;br/&gt;invariants arise from Witten's work using quantum field &lt;br/&gt;theory. These methods of quantum field theory are not &lt;br/&gt;mathematically rigorous, so our mathematically rigorous &lt;br/&gt;proof of Witten's conjecture can be viewed as an extremely&lt;br/&gt;inexpensive form of experimental physics.</AbstractNarration>
