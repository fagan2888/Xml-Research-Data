    <AbstractNarration>The future high-speed networks are expected to support a variety of services such as data,&lt;br/&gt;voice, image, and video with diverse traffic flow characteristics and Quality-of-Service (QoS)&lt;br/&gt;requirements. Developing a framework for the design, control and management of wide&lt;br/&gt;area packet networks which can effciently support such QoS requirements is a fundamental&lt;br/&gt;challenge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional frameworks for the teletraffic analysis of networks and QoS guarantees are&lt;br/&gt;either deterministic or probabilistic. In the deterministic approach, the worst-case traffic&lt;br/&gt;envelopes are used. This most likely will lead to conservative resource allocation policies&lt;br/&gt;and inefficient usage of the network resources. In the standard probabilistic frameworks,&lt;br/&gt;the traffic is usually modeled as a variant of Poisson process, e.g., MMPP, MAP, etc. Such&lt;br/&gt;models are amenable to traditional teletraffic analysis but only capture simple and limited&lt;br/&gt;correlation structures in the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers propose to significantly expand the analytical methodology in solving complex teletraffic problems arising in modern computer and communications networks. Their approach&lt;br/&gt;which is rooted in classical ballot theorem handles a large class of arrival processes including&lt;br/&gt;the standard Markovian processes, general periodic processes, processes described by&lt;br/&gt;time-series (auto-regressive and moving average), or even general processes described by the&lt;br/&gt;joint distribution of number of arrivals in equally-spaced non-overlapping discrete intervals.&lt;br/&gt;Special attention will be paid in deriving algorithmic solutions which are numerically robust&lt;br/&gt;and efficient even when the system utilization is high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers proposed approach is unifying, it avoids root-findings, and unlike the matrix analytical approach or recently introduced state-space spectral decomposition method, it does not&lt;br/&gt;involve potentially expensive iterations. Further, it is transform-free and may provide a&lt;br/&gt;simple form of solution amenable for further analytical studies such as tail behavior or&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers general arrivals processes could be used for the end-to-end performance analysis once the departure process from a network node is appropriately approximated or probabilistically&lt;br/&gt;bounded. Since they are not limited to traditional Markovian models, such an approach&lt;br/&gt;appears to be viable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers propose to implement our general algorithms and make them available as a scientific package to the research community.</AbstractNarration>
