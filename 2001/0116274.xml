    <AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the acquisition of equipment necessary for the establishment of a Micro-Scale Fabrication Facility at the University of Vermont. Specific equipment to be acquired are a reactive ion etcher for microscopic patterning of substrates, a wedge bonder for the attachment of electrodes, a vacuum furnace for annealing, a diamond saw for dicing of individual micro-structures from substrates, and a miniature clean environment for handling and assembly of structures. This equipment will permit the precise microscopic fabrication of physical structures necessary for a number of interdisciplinary micro- and/or nano-scale engineering and scientific initiatives. Planned research projects include micro-scale fluid mixing systems; design and development of micro-scale satellite thruster prototypes; advanced materials and thin film/membrane development; micro-scale environmental contaminant models; nanobiology of human molecular "motors"; and micro-scale ultrasonic bio-sensors for chemical vapor and gas detection. In addition to research efforts, the Micro-Scale Fabrication Facility will be used to develop new interdisciplinary curricula for undergraduate and graduate students centering broadly on issues of microfabrication, micro-scale engineering systems and nanotechnology. Lecture and lab curricula, which focus on micro-fabrication science and technology and make extensive use of the lab facilities, will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of this equipment include enhanced research capabilities; improved educational opportunities and curricula; and increased opportunities with local Vermont industry. The ability to perform in-house micro-fabrication will benefit and expedite research in the areas of micro-electromechanical systems, satellite micro-propulsion concepts, microfluidic mixing, chemical analysis and detection, and advanced materials development. Results of these projects could in turn aid the advancement of miniaturized devices and sensors relevant to space satellite propulsion, pharmaceutical, biomedical, automotive, semiconductor and environmental monitoring applications. The equipment will also lead to new graduate and undergraduate curricular and research opportunities. Students will directly benefit by obtaining advanced and highly-marketable job skills. Finally, opportunities for collaborations between the University of Vermont and state and local industry will be improved. Companies which lack sufficient infrastructure to pursue micro-scale initiatives will have the ability to partner with the University of Vermont and its researchers.</AbstractNarration>
