    <AbstractNarration>CAREER: A Unified Theory of Pseudorandomness&lt;br/&gt;Salil P. Vadhan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the past few decades, randomization has become one of the most&lt;br/&gt;pervasive paradigms in computer science. The best known solutions to&lt;br/&gt;many problems in algorithms, cryptography, reliable communication,&lt;br/&gt;network design, combinatorics, and distributed computing surprisingly&lt;br/&gt;involve making random choices. Thus randomness appears to be very&lt;br/&gt;useful, but it is still not known to what extent it is truly&lt;br/&gt;necessary. Thus, this research asks: is it possible to reduce or even&lt;br/&gt;eliminate the need for randomness in the above settings? The&lt;br/&gt;investigators address this question via the paradigm of&lt;br/&gt;Pseudorandomness, which is the theory of efficiently generating&lt;br/&gt;objects that "look random" despite being constructed using little or&lt;br/&gt;no randomness.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this research builds upon deep connections recently&lt;br/&gt;discovered between four pseudorandom objects, namely pseudorandom&lt;br/&gt;generators, expander graphs, error-correcting codes, and extractors.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators seek to strengthen these connections and use them to&lt;br/&gt;attack some of the open problems in the area, such as the construction&lt;br/&gt;of expander graphs with optimal expansion, the derandomization of&lt;br/&gt;space-bounded computation, and a complete understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between derandomization and circuit lower bounds.&lt;br/&gt;Students at all levels are involved in the research, including&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates who explore conjectures about expander graphs through&lt;br/&gt;computer experiments. The research is tightly integrated into new&lt;br/&gt;courses being developed by the investigators, including a graduate&lt;br/&gt;course on Pseudorandomness, which focuses on the unified theory that&lt;br/&gt;is emerging; and an undergraduate course on Cryptography, which&lt;br/&gt;emphasizes the role of pseudorandomness in modern cryptography.</AbstractNarration>
