    <AbstractNarration>Following A.P. Calderon's program (sketched in his Helsinki ICM &lt;br/&gt;address in 1978), many basic boundary value problems in physics &lt;br/&gt;and engineering can be attacked by starting with a representation &lt;br/&gt;of the solution in the form of a potential operator, and then &lt;br/&gt;reducing matters to analyzing the functional analytic properties&lt;br/&gt;of a system of pseudodifferential operators on the boundary.&lt;br/&gt;The new phenomenon, occurring when non-smooth structures are&lt;br/&gt;present, is that these boundary operators belong to a larger&lt;br/&gt;class, consisting of singular integral operators. The lack of&lt;br/&gt;a symbolic calculus in this context makes the study of such&lt;br/&gt;operators fundamentally harder, particularly when one has to&lt;br/&gt;address such delicate issues like Fredholmness and invertibility.&lt;br/&gt;While in the intervening years these ideas have undergone a&lt;br/&gt;dramatic development, much remains to be done. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the current proposal is to investigate the&lt;br/&gt;specific nature of the singular integral operators arising in&lt;br/&gt;connection with basic problems in mathematical physics, such as&lt;br/&gt;Maxwell's equations, vector Poisson problems, Hodge&lt;br/&gt;decompositions, and Stokes's system of hydrodynamics, in light&lt;br/&gt;of recent advances in the fields of harmonic analysis and&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations. For maximum applicability, it&lt;br/&gt;is important to consider these problems in the context of&lt;br/&gt;general Sobolev-Besov spaces and when the underlying &lt;br/&gt;structures are minimally smooth.</AbstractNarration>
