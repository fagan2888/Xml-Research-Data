    <AbstractNarration>0140362&lt;br/&gt;Lebed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three topics will be investigated under this grant, spanning both nuclear and particle theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) Flavor Symmetries. The PI and his graduate dissertation student (partially funded by this grant) will investigate possible "flavor" symmetries among the three fermion generations, especially the constraints imposed upon them by recent and forthcoming experimental results on neutrino masses and mixing. Additional constraints to be taken into account arise from limits on flavor-changing neutral current processes and proton decay. These studies are designed to work toward answering the question of why there are three replicated generations of fermions with nonetheless widely differing masses and mixings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) Baryons in the Large N Limit. The PI will build upon the numerous successes of QCD with a large number N of color charges (large N) to study the dynamics of baryon resonances. These particles are now being produced in huge numbers at Jefferson Lab, but the theoretical tools currently used to study them are limited. In particular, the PI will seek model-independent results that respect not only the large N expansion, but also the chiral symmetry implied by coupling among pions and nucleons (to which the resonances decay).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Rigorous QCD Constraints on Hadronic Quantities. The imposition of constraints from dispersion relations allows one to make precise statements about QCD amplitudes even in the nonperturbative regime. One obtains relations between fundamental quantities such as quark and gluon parameters on one hand, and measured quantities such as form factors on the other. These relations can provide subtle and highly nontrivial information on the way that the strong interaction works, and form the motivation for this work. The PI will continue this successful program to consider such cases as expanding the range of applicability and including additional information from the region of asymptotic freedom.</AbstractNarration>
