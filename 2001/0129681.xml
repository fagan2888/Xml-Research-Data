    <AbstractNarration>The NLANR Distributed Applications Support Team is focused on supporting&lt;br/&gt;researchers and research communities in the use of resources embedded within&lt;br/&gt;high-performance networks and the middleware-based Grid environments that&lt;br/&gt;depend on those networks. This proposal sets forth a plan for the next stage&lt;br/&gt;for this leading edge team, building on previous efforts and assisting in&lt;br/&gt;the maturing of user communities in the use of distributed resources&lt;br/&gt;connected by advanced networks. This includes the development and extension&lt;br/&gt;of end-user and network engineer oriented tools for both high-bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;optical networks and low-bandwidth wireless networks, which will be the&lt;br/&gt;critical network components for advanced applications in the next several&lt;br/&gt;decades. Support functions will evolve from a focus on specific&lt;br/&gt;projects to being a community support organization fostering the&lt;br/&gt;development, support, and growth of a global community of network engineers&lt;br/&gt;and network support staff working to advance networking in support of global&lt;br/&gt;science. Outreach efforts will be expanded in raising awareness&lt;br/&gt;in new and emerging communities, such as those associated with major NSF MRE&lt;br/&gt;funding, of the dependencies these projects have with respect to networking&lt;br/&gt;technologies.</AbstractNarration>
