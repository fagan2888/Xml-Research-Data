    <AbstractNarration>0120390&lt;br/&gt;Akay&lt;br/&gt;The 23rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE/EMBS (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers/Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society) is to held in Istanbul, October 25-28, 2001. The technical program of the meeting includes the five mini-symposia of Bioinformatics, Nanotechnology in Biomedicine, Functional Imaging, Modeling as a Tool in Neuromuscular and Rehabilitation Research, and Neural Imaging and Computational Imaging. The mini-symposia will introduce prospective investigators to the state-of-the-science in these increasingly important areas of biomedical engineering research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support is being provided to cover partial travel costs for 20 speaker-participants in the mini-symposia. Individuals who receive support are to be selected based on the following: participation in the mini-symposia; young investigators; diversity (gender; minority; disabled); symposia organizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants in the mini-symposia will learn about current research that will contribute to the development of technologies leading to new applications in medicine. Each recipient of support is expected to submit a report describing the research discussed at the mini-symposia having the greatest potential for dramatically influencing the development of new medical technologies.</AbstractNarration>
