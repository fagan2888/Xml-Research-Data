    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues develop an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary training program that would give graduate&lt;br/&gt;students substantive training in both mathematics and biology.&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to produce students competent in both disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;with genuine expertise in applied mathematics and some specific&lt;br/&gt;area of biology: biofluids, ecology and evolutionary biology,&lt;br/&gt;neuroscience, or physiology. Training is built on the Special&lt;br/&gt;Interest Group, which includes faculty members from both&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and biology, students and postdocs, and&lt;br/&gt;industry-based researchers where appropriate.&lt;br/&gt; Modern biology is increasingly mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational. Education and training in components of both&lt;br/&gt;disciplines is needed to prepare people for the 21st century&lt;br/&gt;workforce, for leading-edge research, and for teaching. This&lt;br/&gt;pilot project includes innovative aspects in its thematic&lt;br/&gt;organization, flexible arrangement of both common and&lt;br/&gt;area-specific content, interdisciplinary teaming, combination of&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and experimental training, and involvement of&lt;br/&gt;industrial partners. The combination is promising for fostering&lt;br/&gt;long-term changes by growing a generation of scientists,&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, and engineers who share language and skills well&lt;br/&gt;enough to take up and solve key problems.</AbstractNarration>
