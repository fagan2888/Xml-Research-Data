    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and her colleagues collaborate in a group&lt;br/&gt;project at the Center for BioDynamics (CBD) to provide&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary education and training for graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdoctoral-level investigators in the context of a vigorous&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research program that focuses on areas of&lt;br/&gt;mutual interest in mathematics (especially dynamical systems),&lt;br/&gt;biology, and engineering. Disciplines include mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;biomedical engineering, aerospace/mechanical engineering,&lt;br/&gt;biology, psychology, and physics. Training extends beyond the&lt;br/&gt;usual classroom activities by engaging participants in a variety&lt;br/&gt;of research projects as well. One of the major topics is dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of the nervous system. The projects, which involve experiments,&lt;br/&gt;modeling, and analysis, all deal with the variety of rhythms in&lt;br/&gt;the nervous system and the potential functions of these rhythms&lt;br/&gt;in key cognitive states and processes such as attention,&lt;br/&gt;awareness, learning, and recall. A second major topic is&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of gene expression. Progress in genomic research is&lt;br/&gt;leading to maps of the building blocks of biology and fueling the&lt;br/&gt;study of gene regulation, where proteins often regulate their own&lt;br/&gt;production or that of other proteins in a complex web of&lt;br/&gt;interactions. CBD projects focus on using techniques from&lt;br/&gt;nonlinear dynamics, statistical physics, control theory, and&lt;br/&gt;molecular biology to model, design, and construct synthetic gene&lt;br/&gt;regulatory networks, and to probe naturally occurring gene&lt;br/&gt;regulatory networks. The third major topic is the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;patterns and waves. Training activities include two weekly&lt;br/&gt;working seminars, extra journal clubs and reading groups,&lt;br/&gt;seminars to educate the CBD members in the research going on&lt;br/&gt;within the Center, and a CBD-initiated team-taught course.&lt;br/&gt; The Center for BioDynamics (CBD) helps to advance&lt;br/&gt;understanding of difficult interdisciplinary problems at the&lt;br/&gt;intersection of mathematics, biology, and engineering, and it&lt;br/&gt;trains mathematicians, scientists, and engineers for the 21st&lt;br/&gt;century workforce. It does this by combining traditional&lt;br/&gt;classroom education with significant engagement of students and&lt;br/&gt;postdocs in interdisciplinary teams working on current problems.&lt;br/&gt;The disciplines involved are mathematics, biomedical engineering,&lt;br/&gt;aerospace/mechanical engineering, biology, psychology, and&lt;br/&gt;physics. One of the major topics is dynamics of the nervous&lt;br/&gt;system. The projects in this topic seek to shed light on the&lt;br/&gt;origin of the electrical activity in the brain, and how the brain&lt;br/&gt;uses this activity to process sensory information, to think, and&lt;br/&gt;to regulate movement. A second major topic is dynamics of gene&lt;br/&gt;expression. The web of interactions among the proteins that are&lt;br/&gt;produced by genes is complex; the projects associated with this&lt;br/&gt;topic involve the design and construction of artificial gene&lt;br/&gt;regulatory networks, and techniques to better understand&lt;br/&gt;naturally occurring gene regulatory networks. The third major&lt;br/&gt;topic is the dynamics of patterns and waves, occuring in a&lt;br/&gt;variety of applications. Training activities include two weekly&lt;br/&gt;working seminars, regular sessions to read scientific journals,&lt;br/&gt;seminars to educate the CBD members in the research going on&lt;br/&gt;within the Center, and a CBD-initiated team-taught course. The&lt;br/&gt;project is supported by the Computational Mathematics, Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, Computational Neuroscience, and Biological Databases&lt;br/&gt;and Informatics programs and by the MPS Office of&lt;br/&gt;Multidisciplinary Activities.</AbstractNarration>
