    <AbstractNarration>NSF ITR Proposal #0113810&lt;br/&gt;Compositional Connectors&lt;br/&gt;David Garlan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For systems composed from independently developed parts, specialized forms of&lt;br/&gt;interaction are often needed to bridge component mismatches or to achieve&lt;br/&gt;extra-functional properties (e.g., security, reliability), making the design and&lt;br/&gt;implementation of these interaction mechanisms a critical issue. Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;system developers have few options: they must live with available, but often&lt;br/&gt;inadequate, generic support for interaction (such as RPC), or they must&lt;br/&gt;handcraft specialized mechanisms at great cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates a new approach whereby interaction mechanisms are&lt;br/&gt;constructed compositionally. Specifically, basic connectors (such as RPC or&lt;br/&gt;data streams) can be augmented with selected adaptations or enhancements to&lt;br/&gt;produce a more complex connector that meets the system requirements. This&lt;br/&gt;work will investigate the hypothesis that (a) there exists a collection of&lt;br/&gt;general-purpose transformations that can be applied to connectors to produce&lt;br/&gt;increasingly rich forms of interaction, and (b) tools can be built to automate&lt;br/&gt;the application of these transformations to existing interaction mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will reduce the cost of component integration by&lt;br/&gt;partially automating the production of complex interaction mechanisms, improve&lt;br/&gt;the quality of systems by making it simple to add security and dependability&lt;br/&gt;features, and develop new foundations for specifying and reasoning about complex&lt;br/&gt;interaction mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>
