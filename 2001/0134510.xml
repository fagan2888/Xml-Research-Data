    <AbstractNarration>The PI proposes study, using a number of state-of-the-art experimental techniques, a long-standing-but still inadequately understood-problem of fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Annular flow, in which vapor flows through the center of a tube surrounded by a thin film of liquid on the wall, is the dominant flow condition in many heat exchanger applications involving evaporation or condensation. The results could lead to improved models for flows in power, refrigeration and air-conditioning systems, with less reliance on empirical data gathered over a narrow range of operating conditions. An educational development plan includes non-traditional approaches to the therm-fluids cycle of the undergraduate curriculum, as well as incorporation of research results into upper level courses in multiphase flow and convective heat transfer.</AbstractNarration>
