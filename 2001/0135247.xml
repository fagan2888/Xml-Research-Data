    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Dunning will use atoms in high Rydberg states as a tool with which to conduct a comprehensive study of the formation and properties of a wide variety of negative ion species. Electron transfer reactions in which the excited Rydberg electron is captured by a target molecule will be investigated to obtain information on the energetics of dissociative electron attachment. This will be accomplished through detailed measurements of the angular and velocity distributions of the product ions. Kinematic studies will be used to explore the mechanisms by which such species are created. The dependence of their lifetime on the rotational (and vibrational) states of the parent neutral will be investigated to gain new insights into the coupling of rotational and electronic motions. Collisions of dipole-bound ions with attaching and polar targets will be examined to explore their chemical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Atoms in which one electron is excited to a high-lying state will be used to conduct a comprehensive study of electron capture by molecules. Aside from their fundamental interest, the results of this research will have important practical application in areas such as breakdown in high-voltage electrical equipment, industrial plasma processing, and in screening the toxicological properties of new compounds. The work will provide practical training for both graduate and undergraduate students and equip them with a valuable array of experimental skills in preparation for advanced studies or entry into the scientific/technological workforce.</AbstractNarration>
