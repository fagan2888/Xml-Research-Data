    <AbstractNarration>This 5-year Retention and Renewal proposal, targeting Boston Public Schools, builds on the extensive professional development work of EDC and TERC. The"Cultivating Leadership to Support Elementary Mathematics Education Reform in Boston" project, targets approximately 400 teacher leaders who participate in over 200 hours of professional development. Administrator leaders participate in over 45 hours of professional development, and an additional 600 teachers participate in at least 130 hours of professional development through the leadership work in each school. The professional development designed to strengthen participants' mathematics teaching practice will support schools in the implementation of the Investigations in Number, Data and Space. All 87 elementary schools in Boston will be supported by this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition the project targets seven carefully selected schools where teacher and administrator leadership is firmly in place and there is a school-wide focus on mathematics teaching and learning. These "Learning Site Schools" will serve as resources to other schools in the district, providing opportunities to learn about how teacher and administrator leadership is developed, how leadership is leveraged within a school, and how a school-wide focus on mathematics teaching and learning is created and sustained. Two additional schools, one without the infrastructure to support reform and one with minimal infrastructure to support these efforts, will receive extensive support. Research documenting the change process for schools at different stages of reform will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>
