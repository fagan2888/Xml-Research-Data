    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;EEC-0122025&lt;br/&gt;Taylor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is in partnership between the ERC for Computer-Integrated Surgical Systems and Technology (CISST) at the Johns Hopkins University and the ERC for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (CenSSIS) at the Northeastern University. The common objective of the two collaborating groups is to develop core imaging and computer technologies to assist the physician in the treatment of the diseases of human eye. The two teams will address the problem of integrating a variety of medical images into a common description in the form of a quantitative anatomical atlas of the eye. The research is expected to deliver an interventional tool to the correct area on the retina, in a manner that maximizes the dosage to the region of interest and minimizes the dosage to healthy areas. The expertise of steady hand robotics of the Johns Hopkins University will be combined with the expertise in subsurface sensing and imaging of the Northeastern University.</AbstractNarration>
