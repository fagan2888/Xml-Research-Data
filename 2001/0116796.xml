    <AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to sponsor travel expenses for graduate students and junior faculty members&lt;br/&gt;to attend the 7th IEEE Real-Time Technology and Application Symposium (RTAS) to be held&lt;br/&gt;in Taipei, Taiwan and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Real-&lt;br/&gt;Time Systems. RTAS provides a forum for presenting the latest advances in real-time systems&lt;br/&gt;research and for discussing the practical challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. A&lt;br/&gt;special mission of RTAS 2001 is to foster discussion and technology exchange in the real-time&lt;br/&gt;computing and communication communities between Asia and North America. As such, we have&lt;br/&gt;invited Dr. C. L. Liu (who developed the rate-monotonic scheduling theory in the 70's and is&lt;br/&gt;currently the president of National Ching-Hua University in Hsin-Chu, Taiwan) to serve as the&lt;br/&gt;Honorary Chair, and top-notch researchers in both Asia, Americas, and Europe to serve on the&lt;br/&gt;Technical Program Committee. In addition to single-track technical sessions, we will also organize&lt;br/&gt;tutorials and workshops that address practical, temporal QoS issues in application domains or over&lt;br/&gt;the Internet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The symposium, as many other academic activities, relies on the experience of senior members&lt;br/&gt;of the community but requires fresh ideas and new people to join the community. As such, and&lt;br/&gt;to encourage graduate students and young faculty members to participate in the exciting technical&lt;br/&gt;program, we are requesting support to defray the travel expenses for graduate students and junior&lt;br/&gt;faculty attendees. The total amount requested is $12,000 on the basis of an average travel grant&lt;br/&gt;of $1,200 for each selected junior faculty participant and $800 for each selected graduate student.&lt;br/&gt;We believe attendance at this Symposium will be very beneficial to young scientists who otherwise&lt;br/&gt;would be unable to participlate in the gathering. Contacts for future (international) collaborations&lt;br/&gt;will be made and idea exchange will certainly occur. Travel support for student and junior faculty&lt;br/&gt;attendance will be advertised nationwide and women, minorities and disabled students will be&lt;br/&gt;especially encouraged to apply for sponsorship.</AbstractNarration>
