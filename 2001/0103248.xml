    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted in response to the solicitation "Nanoscale Science and Engineering" (NSF 00-119). The project addresses the fabrication of quantum scale devices through the combined oxidation and etching of Si/SiGe/Si nanostructured pillars. The project aims to demonstrate the validity of nanoscale computing by developing a process technology to fashion quantum dots of a predictable size, shape and placement, suitable for mass production and simple electrical contact. The project includes specific strategies and processes to control the size and composition of the nanostructured pillars and the resulting quantum dots and oxide insulators to be formed. The research spans issues of materials science, circuits, and device fabrication and characterization; the structures to be fabricated are closely integrated with quantum level devices necessary for cellular automata circuits. Methods of high speed testing to characterize the devices as well as theoretical modeling to optimally design the structures are included. The project is highly collaborative between Ohio State, Illinois, Notre Dame, UC Riverside, the Naval Research Laboratory and Air Force Research Laboratory. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The project brings together electrical engineers, material scientists, physicists, computer scientists, experimentalists, and theoreticians for the purpose of realizing advanced nanostructured quantum dot devices. The project is designed to develop strong technical, communication, and organizational/management skills in students through unique educational experiences made possible by a forefront research environment. There will be active involvement of undergraduates in the program with an emphasis on developing effective oral and written communication skills. Cross-disciplinary research and site visits to each other will enhance the educational process. The project is co-supported by the DMR/EM and ECS/EPDT Divisions/Programs.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
