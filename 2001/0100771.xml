    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0100771.&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Peter B. Kronheimer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this project is to apply gauge-theory techniques to&lt;br/&gt;the study of three-dimensional manifolds. The principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator proposes to investigate Floer homology and closely&lt;br/&gt;related areas of geometry, and hopes to shed light on the&lt;br/&gt;applicability of gauge theory to problems in three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;topology. In particular, it is hoped that a relation can be&lt;br/&gt;established between the Floer homologies of three-manifolds&lt;br/&gt;defined on the one hand by the monopole equations on the other&lt;br/&gt;hand by the instanton equations. (These are the equations which,&lt;br/&gt;in four-dimensions, lead respectively to the Seiberg-Witten&lt;br/&gt;invariants and Donaldson invariants of four-manifolds, and which&lt;br/&gt;have led to an flood of results in four-dimensional differential&lt;br/&gt;topology in the past twenty years.) A first goal is to prove&lt;br/&gt;that if the instanton Floer homology of manifold with first betti&lt;br/&gt;number one is trivial in the strong sense that all the&lt;br/&gt;representations of the fundamental group can be made to disappear&lt;br/&gt;by a holonomy perturbation, then the monopole Floer homology&lt;br/&gt;groups are trivial also. (For the instanton groups, the relevant&lt;br/&gt;representations are the representations in SO(3) with non-trivial&lt;br/&gt;Stiefel-Whitney class.) By an application of a non-vanishing&lt;br/&gt;theorem for the monopole Floer homology and use of Floer's exact&lt;br/&gt;triangle, this would lead to a proof of the "Property P&lt;br/&gt;conjecture". A related goal in this project is the development&lt;br/&gt;of new constructions for Floer homology, based on the technique&lt;br/&gt;of finite-dimensional approximation (which has already seen&lt;br/&gt;convincing application in the study of the four-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;invariants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness.&lt;br/&gt;Its importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by&lt;br/&gt;the French mathematician Poincaro, during his investigation of&lt;br/&gt;the laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body&lt;br/&gt;system such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to&lt;br/&gt;Newton's laws. In the past twenty years, topology has seen&lt;br/&gt;applications in questions such as the knotting of proteins and&lt;br/&gt;DNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics. The topology&lt;br/&gt;of three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher&lt;br/&gt;dimension, is of particular subtlety. Through this project, it&lt;br/&gt;is hoped to bring new techniques to bear on outstanding questions&lt;br/&gt;in three-dimensional topology. These techniques -- gauge theory&lt;br/&gt;and the Seiberg-Witten equations -- originated in physics, where&lt;br/&gt;they had potential application to fundamental questions such as&lt;br/&gt;quark confinement. They have been an effective tool in the study&lt;br/&gt;of four-dimensional spaces (such as our space-time). The aim now&lt;br/&gt;is to apply the same techniques to questions in dimension three.</AbstractNarration>
