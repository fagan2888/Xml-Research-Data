    <AbstractNarration>Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include studies&lt;br/&gt;of supersymmetry and other new theories of fundamental particle&lt;br/&gt;interactions. Supersymmetry is a promising idea which predicts the&lt;br/&gt;existence of many new heavy subatomic particles. The properties of these&lt;br/&gt;particles, including their masses and the rates at which they decay into&lt;br/&gt;other particles, will be studied under a variety of different theoretical&lt;br/&gt;assumptions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The resulting predictions are important because they will affect both&lt;br/&gt;the planning and the analysis of many present and future experiments that&lt;br/&gt;search for new particles. These studies are of central importance for&lt;br/&gt;understanding the behavior of particle physics involving interactions at&lt;br/&gt;very high energies. They will also impact on our understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;physics of the very early universe, when the particles under consideration&lt;br/&gt;would have been plentiful.</AbstractNarration>
