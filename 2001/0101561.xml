    <AbstractNarration>Project Title: K-theory of operator algebras and its&lt;br/&gt; applications to topology of manifolds &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Guoliang Yu &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The investigator proposes to study the K-theory &lt;br/&gt;of operator algebras associated to metric spaces and groups, and its &lt;br/&gt;applications to topology of manifolds. The K-theory of such &lt;br/&gt;operator algebras are receptacles of higher indices of elliptic &lt;br/&gt;differential operators and have important applications to problems &lt;br/&gt;in differential geometry and topology of manifolds such as &lt;br/&gt;the existence problem for Riemannian metrics with positive&lt;br/&gt;scalar curvature, the Novikov conjecture on homotopy invariance of&lt;br/&gt;higher signatures. The methods to be employed include &lt;br/&gt;controlled operator K-theory, infinite dimensional almost flat bundles, &lt;br/&gt;and geometric group theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manifolds are spaces glued together by Euclidean spaces. Examples &lt;br/&gt;of manifolds include spheres and tori. In differential geometry &lt;br/&gt;one studies how manifolds are curved. For example a flat piece of &lt;br/&gt;paper has zero curvature while the sphere has positive curvature. &lt;br/&gt;This is why we can not bend a piece of paper into a sphere. A basic&lt;br/&gt;problem in differential geometry is to determine when a manifold &lt;br/&gt;can have positive scalar curvature. Another important problem in &lt;br/&gt;mathematics is the classification of manifolds. By surgery theory &lt;br/&gt;the classification problem for higher dimensional manifolds &lt;br/&gt;can be essentially reduced to the Novikov conjecture. The K-theoretic &lt;br/&gt;higher indices of certain elliptic differential operators can be used&lt;br/&gt;to attack the positive scalar curvature problem and the Novikov &lt;br/&gt;conjecture. A key step in this analytic approach is the computation &lt;br/&gt;of the K-theoretic higher indices, which can be essentially&lt;br/&gt;reduced to the problem of computing the K-theory of operator algebras &lt;br/&gt;associated to metric spaces and groups.</AbstractNarration>
