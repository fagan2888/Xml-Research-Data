    <AbstractNarration>Numerical modeling tools have been used in the liquid crystal arena for several years. They are typically used interactively to explore effects and to optimize the performance of devices with respect to controllable material and device parameters. Until recently, satisfactory results could be achieved by using one-dimensional (1-D) models, which treat the transverse dimensions of the structures as infinite and uniform. Current developments (smaller feature sizes, new technologies) are forcing more realistic 2-D and 3-D modeling. The numerical algorithms utilized in current modeling tools require several minutes on contemporary platforms to analyze a 2-D device; for 3-D, they take several hours. Significant improvements in the numerical approaches are needed to produce acceptable performance in these higher dimensional settings. The principal investigator will work with device-modeling physicists and experts in the applied mathematics and numerical analysis communities to adapt and develop the advanced numerical methods necessary to model realistic optical devices based upon liquid crystal materials. Modern numerical algorithms hold the promise of enabling 3-D modeling in times that are comparable to the current generation of 1-D tools (seconds). These tools are expected to have a significant impact on the development of liquid crystal optics technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is concerned with the development and analysis of numerical modeling tools for devices based on liquid crystal materials. Liquid crystals are important in technology because they can be used to control light. Numerous applications exist (e.g., lap-top and flat-panel displays), and new ones are being developed, including tablet document readers (e-books, electronic newspapers) and beam-steering devices (for soft, programmable, non-mechanical applications in communications and switching). Modern numerical algorithms hold the promise of enabling full modeling of liquid crystal devices in a matter of seconds. Such tools will be of immense practical utility and can be expected to have a big impact in the development of technologies in this and related areas.</AbstractNarration>
