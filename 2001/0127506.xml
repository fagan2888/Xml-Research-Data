    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;Conservation of the earth's biological diversity is a pressing problem that excites and&lt;br/&gt;motivates students from a wide range of institutions and disciplinary backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;Conservation biology is widely taught now, but it is seriously hampered by a lack of&lt;br/&gt;resources that capture its potential for inquiry-based learning. To foster changes in course&lt;br/&gt;content, curricula, and educational practices in conservation biology, The Center for&lt;br/&gt;Biodiversity and Conservation (CBC) at the American Museum of Natural History, the&lt;br/&gt;State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-&lt;br/&gt;ESF), and the University of Maine (UMaine) have formed a partnership to link faculty,&lt;br/&gt;graduate students, and undergraduates with practicing professionals to generate an&lt;br/&gt;extensive set of classroom-tested, inquiry-based-learning materials. Each completed draft&lt;br/&gt;module will be evaluated in a classroom situation at UMaine and SUNY-ESF as well as&lt;br/&gt;at several pilot sites: Antioch New England Graduate School, Holyoke Community&lt;br/&gt;College, Lehman College, City University of New York, Long Island University,&lt;br/&gt;Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, Prescott College, and Columbia&lt;br/&gt;University. A distinguishing project feature is its self-sustaining dissemination.&lt;br/&gt;Distribution of materials to undergraduate instructors will happen through three media: 1)&lt;br/&gt;an edited volume published by a commercial publisher; 2) CD-ROMs distributed by the&lt;br/&gt;CBC at cost; and 3) via an internet portal website hosted by the CBC. Over three years,&lt;br/&gt;approximately 50 instructors and 50 students will work directly on developing materials;&lt;br/&gt;about 20 instructors in 25 diverse courses will test modules with at least 600&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate students at pilot sites and provide feedback.</AbstractNarration>
