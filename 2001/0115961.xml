    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program, Tennessee Technological University will acquire acquire a variable pressure scanning electron microscope with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attachment and ancillary sample preparation equipment for multidisciplinary, integrated research and education. The instrument will provide a core facility for all departments in the College of Engineering, the College of Arts and Sciences and Tennessee Technological University's three State funded Centers of Excellence. Specific ongoing research or proposed research in the following areas will benefit: (1) hydration kinetics of waste materials in portland cement, (2) controlled deposition of boron on silicon from solid dopant sources, (3) fracture toughness determination by fractographic observation, (4) fatigue crack front evolution tracking, (5) in situ mechanical testing of microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, (6) point defect and fracture mechanics of Laves phases, (7) environmental embrittlement of intermetalic alloys, (8) novel coatings for interconnect materials in solid oxide fuel cells, (9) trophic interactions between Legionella and protozoa, (10) interactions of protozoa and mycobacteria species, (11) community structure of protozoa, and (12) identification and characterization of microfossils. The new facility will also be used to enhance existing laboratory opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, further develop ongoing NSF funded Course Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement projects and promote greater interaction with local area elementary and high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program, Tennessee Technological University (TTU) will acquire acquire a variable pressure scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectroscopy attachment and ancillary sample preparation equipment for multidisciplinary, integrated research and education. TTU serves Tennessee and the surrounding states by providing a highly ranked regional university environment. As such, the TTU faculty is primarily involved in applied research serving the regional industrial community. The acquisition of instruments, such as the proposed scanning electron microscope, enables TTU to achieve its mission and obligation to this community by providing state-of-the-art facilities to train students, to conduct applied research for industrial constituents and to attract and conduct basic research. The new SEM is to be a core facility in support of a wide range of ongoing and future interdisciplinary research and educational activities at TTU. Current research programs include utilization of waste in portland cement, development of materials for advanced fuel cell applications, fundamental studies regarding the mechanical behavior of metals and ceramics, microbiology of pathogen-cell interactions and single cell animal behavior and investigation of microfossils. The new facility will also be used to enhance existing laboratory opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, further develop ongoing NSF funded Course Curriculum and Laboratory Improvement projects and promote greater interaction with local area elementary and high schools.</AbstractNarration>
