    <AbstractNarration>The 2002 IEEE-AP-S International Symposium &amp; USNC/USRI National Radio Science Meeting is an annual international conference co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), and the Union of Radio Science International (URSI). The conference regularly draws about one thousand participants representing academia and industry. The Antennas and Propagation Society (AP-S) of the IEEE along with several subgroups of URSI will meet in San Antonio, Texas in June 2002.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each year, the Antennas and Propagation Society promotes student participation in the conference through a number of mechanisms. One of the most important is the Student Paper Competition at the conference. This selective program brings the world's best students together in an integrated program in which they present their work to a technical audience including a group of judges. The program helps develop the students' technical acumen as well as their communication and presentation skills. It also helps introduce them to the international technical community and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next generation of electromagnetic technologists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The AP-S provides financial support of various forms including assistance in finding low cost housing. but does not reimburse travel expenses. Travel support from NSF will aid students from U.S. universities only and will ensure that the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from the U.S. universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests support to defray the travel expenses for young investigators whose papers have been selected for presentation at the Conference, but who lack funds and might not be able to attend without such support. It is proposed that the AP-S Technical Program Committee select those from U.S. universities to receive the support.</AbstractNarration>
