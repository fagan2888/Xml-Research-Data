    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes the development of a low-cost desktop true three dimensional (3-D) information display system suitable for commercialization during Phase III. The proposed video monitor will provide highly realistic static and dynamic 3-D images by presenting information over a volumetric space, rather than a conventional planar space. As a result, the displayed information neither suffers from the loss of actual depth information as in a conventional monitor, nor requires the use of specially designed eyeglasses needed for stereovision systems. Fullcolor true 3-D views will be generated by projecting plane-by-plane image slices onto a projection screen that moves backward and forward in synchronization with the information generated on a CRT screen. By accessing these planes-of-view 30 times per second, flicker-free true 3-D views are generated over a volumetric space that are viewable from multiple angles. The anticipated low cost of this practical system should make it affordable for personal use since it will be designed primarily with commercially available system components, aided by novel digital imaging techniques and software approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thus, the proposed system is expected to find many diverse applications ranging from scientific and industrial visualization to entertainment. Some of the initial applications include biomedical image processing, scientific visualization, protein structure determination, general-purpose 3-D computer graphics, radar imaging, battlefield management, and aircraft design.</AbstractNarration>
