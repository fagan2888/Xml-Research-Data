    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop the Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process to modify surface properties of particulate matter in a fluidized bed. The proposed Fluidized Bed CCVD (FBCCVD) technique will enable production of next generation surface engineered powders for applications such as decorative and specialty chemicals. In the CCVD process, low-cost, environmentally friendly, metal-bearing reagents are dissolved in solvents that serve as a combustible fuel. Using MicroCoating Technologies (MCT) innovative atomizer, the Nanomiser TM , this solution is atomized to form submicron droplets that are then combusted in a flame to produce the desired material. This flame-based method will be integrated with an externally recirculating fluidized bed and used to encapsulate particulate matter suspended in the fluidized bed with dense and well-adhered thin films. The effect of the FBCCVD process variables on the encapsulated powder properties, deposition efficiency, and production rate will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Inexpensive powders with functionalized surfaces are in high demand for decorative, optical, specialty chemicals, and electronics applications. The powder market is estimated to be over a billion dollar market annually and represents a growing segment. Success of the proposed research will result in a new FBCCVD process that could facilitate inexpensive production of encapsulated powders.</AbstractNarration>
