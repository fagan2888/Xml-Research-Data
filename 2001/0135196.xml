    <AbstractNarration>Tremendous growth in information and biomedical technologies coupled with the increased complexity of modern transportation systems has fostered an increased demand for sensors and actuators with higher performance, enhanced reliability, and lower cost. Magnetostrictive sensors/actuators have become increasingly popular and can be found in a diverse set of applications ranging from on-line torque sensors in automobiles to acoustic transducers in hearing aids. Yet, monolithic versions of the most popular magnetostrictives are prone to several technical problems including low tensile strength, brittle fracture, high eddy current losses, and complex and costly manufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;One solution to these problems is to develop a magnetostrictive composite sensor/actuator in which the desirable properties of the magnetostrictive phase are combined with those of the matrix phase to create a composite of high strength, excellent processability, and low eddy current losses. Although some initial attempts have been undertaken to develop magnetostrictive composites, very little work has been accomplished in several key areas. A comprehensive experimental database spanning the full range of volume fraction is currently lacking. No comprehensive micromechanical model has emerged to design magnetostrictive composites for specific performance targets.&lt;br/&gt;This research project will focus on generating a complete set of magnetomechanical experimental data spanning the full range of volume fraction for magnetostrictive (Terfenol-D) composites. The experimental data will then be utilized in developing a micromechanical model for performance prediction and design of sensors/actuators. The ultimate aim of the research is to provide the scientific and engineering basis for industrial application of magnetostrictive composites technology. From a broader perspective this research project addresses the NSF and national initiative for IT research and development by addressing the need for further scientific efforts in developing new and better sensors and actuators.</AbstractNarration>
