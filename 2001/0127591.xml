    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Materials Science (57)&lt;br/&gt;In order to solve simple as well as involved materials science problems the use of spreadsheet solutions has been underutilized by educators. We have developed a suite of problems in materials science that lend themselves to spreadsheet solutions. Our materials enable students to work on the collection of data, graphing techniques, and analysis of may problem types. Toward this end a workbook containing a complete set of tutorials, applications, problem solutions, and a study guide has been created. In addition an instructor's manual is also available. These materials have been designed for use in high schools and colleges. We are disseminating our materials through symposia and publications. We are also distributing our materials through a publisher as well as the Internet.</AbstractNarration>
