    <AbstractNarration>Gross&lt;br/&gt;0110920&lt;br/&gt; The investigators develop methods to carry out spatially&lt;br/&gt;explicit control to link natural and anthropogenic forces that&lt;br/&gt;influence the demand for biological resources with the dynamics&lt;br/&gt;of those resources. While there have been numerous alternative&lt;br/&gt;approaches taken to add spatial components to population models,&lt;br/&gt;few of these have attempted to deal with spatial control. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators evaluate extensions of optimal control methods for&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems to spatial problems, with a focus on general&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational issues for spatial control linked&lt;br/&gt;with abiotic forcing of populations. The effort is motivated by&lt;br/&gt;two specific examples. The first concerns black bears in the&lt;br/&gt;southern Appalachians, a population with explicit environmental&lt;br/&gt;forcing associated with acorn mast production, which varies&lt;br/&gt;considerably in time and space. This interacts with hunting,&lt;br/&gt;which is spatially restricted. The second example involves an&lt;br/&gt;invasive exotic plant species, Lygodium microphyllum (Old World&lt;br/&gt;Climbing Fern), in the Everglades of South Florida. This species&lt;br/&gt;can completely cover the native tree islands of the region and&lt;br/&gt;spatial control of hydrology may be applied to limit its growth.&lt;br/&gt; Many of the current problems in regional management involve&lt;br/&gt;issues of spatial control -- what to do, where to do it and for&lt;br/&gt;what time periods. Examples include alternative plans for land&lt;br/&gt;use, forest harvesting, location of dams, and water control. A&lt;br/&gt;wide variety of the major environmental public policy issues in&lt;br/&gt;the US require scientific assessments of the impacts of&lt;br/&gt;alternative management. The investigators develop new&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and computational approaches that can aid managers&lt;br/&gt;and the public to compare alternative management plans of land&lt;br/&gt;and regional resources. The objective also is to allow for&lt;br/&gt;comparisons of alternative criteria, arising from different&lt;br/&gt;stakeholders, to judge the public utility of different spatial&lt;br/&gt;management plans. The project is supported by the Applied&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, Computational Mathematics, and Population Biology&lt;br/&gt;programs and by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.</AbstractNarration>
