    <AbstractNarration>In this work the PI will exploit the mode selectivity properties of two-dimensional arrays of closely spaced leaky-mode VCSELs to achieve spatially-coherent light sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two-dimensional arrays of closely spaced antiguided VCSELs offer a unique platform to study the optical modal properties of an active photonic lattice. He proposes the first comprehensive above-threshold study of the leaky-modes supported by such photonic lattice structures. The allowed leaky-mode photonic bands of 2-D active photonic lattices have not been studied to date. An understanding of the propagating leaky-modes and the influence of nonlinear gain, carrier-induced-index variations, and thermal lensing, above laser threshold will result in a valuable knowledge base for the development of next generation optical sources. He proposes a closely coupled experimental and theoretical program to study the unique properties of these structures and exploit these properties for the development of novel diode laser sources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These structures have high potential for the realization of compact monolithic surface emitting sources with high-spatial coherence. Unlike conventional VCSEL arrays, the proposed devices have gain placed in the low-index lattice sites, thus relying on long-range (coherent) coupling via leaky waves. Based on an MOCVD regrowth process, the built-in refractive index step of the antiguides can be quite large (Dn = 0.10 - 0.20), making the structure less sensitive to waveguide pertubations which occur above laser threshold. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel device structures based on 2-D active photonic lattices are proposed for achieving spatially-coherent surface emitting sources:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Laterally resonant, large-area spatially-coherent 2-D phase-locked arrays: Antiguided VCSEL devices involving large-area phase-locked arrays of rectangular- as well as of triangular-lattice configuration relying on radially resonant leaky-wave coupling, which in turn insures uniform intensity profile across the entire array structure, and thus coherent operation to high drive levels above threshold.&lt;br/&gt;2. Radiation fanout vertical cavity semiconductor optical amplifiers: Arrays of leaky-wave-coupled vertical-cavity surface-emitting amplifiers (VCSOA) hold potential not only for providing high amplified output powers but also act as a large-volume gain media for nonlinear interactions such as four-wave mixing. &lt;br/&gt;3. Low-index defect based lasers: lattice-defect" VCSEL devices are proposed relying on radially antiresonant devices, which allow single-mode operation from emitting areas an order of magnitude larger than conventional VCSELs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed devices have potential as high-coherent-power (&gt; 100 mW), circular-beam monolithic sources for use as transmitters (l=1.3-1.55mm) or amplifier pump sources (l=0.98mm) in fiber-optical communication systems.</AbstractNarration>
