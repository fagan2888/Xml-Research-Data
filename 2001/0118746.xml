    <AbstractNarration>Six to seven speakers each have been invited from the United States of America, Argentina and Brazil to cover topics on exploration of microbial diversity, uses of biodiversity, plant-microbe interactions and genomics. The aim of this workshop is to explore the possibilities of interaction between North and South scientific groups of Brazil, Argentina and the United States in the fields of microbial diversity and biocomplexity. The primary goals of the meeting consist of exploring and using microbial diversity for biotechnological purposes; starting studies of biocomplexity beginning at the level of interactions between microorganisms and other biological, physical, and chemical systems and proposing possible joint projects. This meeting promotes the participation of not only senior investigators, but also graduate students and postdoctoral fellows from Argentina and Brazil. This award provides funds to cover roundtrip airfare costs from the USA to Buenos Aires, the site of the workshop, for the seven participants from the United States. The final program, conclusions and recommendations will be forwarded to the NSF and distributed to the participants.</AbstractNarration>
