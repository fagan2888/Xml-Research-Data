    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0101539&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: William Abikoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium is to be held in October 2001 at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Connecticut campus at Storrs. This award primarily&lt;br/&gt;supports the participation of graduate students, junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers, and speakers. Plenary lectures are planned to cover&lt;br/&gt;a wide-ranging agenda in geometric function theory, hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, dynamics, and other topics and workshop days early in&lt;br/&gt;the meeting are planned to showcase junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium is one of a series of conferences on&lt;br/&gt;geometric function theory, Riemann surfaces and related topics&lt;br/&gt;that have been held every three or four years since 1965. The&lt;br/&gt;meetings' name honors Lars Ahlfors and Lipman Bers, two giants in&lt;br/&gt;complex analysis who shaped the meeting's subjects over the&lt;br/&gt;twentieth century. The current core of geometric function theory&lt;br/&gt;consists mainly of Riemann surfaces (two-dimensional spaces&lt;br/&gt;defined over the complex numbers, such as the collection of all&lt;br/&gt;complex solutions to a typical single polynomial equation in two&lt;br/&gt;variables), Teichmueller theory (an approach to studying the&lt;br/&gt;variations of structure possible for a particular Riemann&lt;br/&gt;surface), Kleinian groups (the most important discrete groups of&lt;br/&gt;isometries of hyperbolic three-space), iteration of rational&lt;br/&gt;functions (which combines dynamical systems ideas with function&lt;br/&gt;theory), and hyperbolic manifolds. This core reaches back 150&lt;br/&gt;years and meets or includes some of the most active specialties&lt;br/&gt;in current mathematical research.&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0101539&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: William Abikoff&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Ahlfors-Bers Colloquium is to be held in October 2001 at the&lt;br/&gt;University of Connecticut campus at Storrs.
