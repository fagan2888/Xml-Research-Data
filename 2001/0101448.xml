    <AbstractNarration>This award will support preparing, carrying out, and analyzing a&lt;br/&gt;series of measurements of electromagnetic structure of matter by the&lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts Group, primarily at the Stanford Linear&lt;br/&gt;Accelerator Center (SLAC) and for conducting a program of graduate&lt;br/&gt;and undergraduate education in experimental high energy nuclear&lt;br/&gt;physics. This work has as a common thread the use of high energy&lt;br/&gt;(sometimes polarized) electrons and gamma rays to probe matter. A&lt;br/&gt;major area of work will be the data runs, analysis, and publications&lt;br/&gt;for SLAC Experiment E158 that will use the SLAC high intensity&lt;br/&gt;polarized electron beam and a new dedicated spectrometer and&lt;br/&gt;detector system to measure parity violating asymmetry in&lt;br/&gt;electron-electron scattering. This high precision data will provide&lt;br/&gt;important tests of the Standard Model of matter at low momentum&lt;br/&gt;transfer in the electromagnetic coupling via the interference&lt;br/&gt;between exchange of virtual photons and Z bosons. The UMass Group&lt;br/&gt;has contributed to the design of the spectrometer and beamline&lt;br/&gt;instrumentation, to the calibration systems, and to implementation&lt;br/&gt;of the data acquisition system. The UMass Group is taking a leading&lt;br/&gt;role in developing a new high intensity, high energy&lt;br/&gt;quasi-monoenergic polarized photon beam facility to be build at SLAC&lt;br/&gt;for a program of experiments: 1) to measure the high energy&lt;br/&gt;contribution to the Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn sum rule 2) to measure the&lt;br/&gt;nuclear dependence of the photoproduction of charmed mesons and 3)&lt;br/&gt;to measure the gluon spin distribution using polarized&lt;br/&gt;photoproduction of charmed mesons.</AbstractNarration>
