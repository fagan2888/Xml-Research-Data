    <AbstractNarration>Mischaikow&lt;br/&gt;0107396&lt;br/&gt; The goal of this project is to better understand the&lt;br/&gt;relationship between dispersal rates and the spatio-temporal&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneity of environments. In particular, the investigator&lt;br/&gt;would like to understand if there are any fundamental&lt;br/&gt;relationships upon which a framework for this theory can be&lt;br/&gt;developed. Therefore, to minimize extraneous effects the&lt;br/&gt;investigator continues to study what is perhaps the simplest&lt;br/&gt;continuous model that explicitly incorporates a spatial variable:&lt;br/&gt;a system of reaction diffusion equations with Lotka-Volterra&lt;br/&gt;reaction terms, where the reaction term of each species is&lt;br/&gt;identical, and where the birth rate is spatially and temporally&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous. This model allows for a variety of perturbations&lt;br/&gt;through which one can study the impact of various factors in the&lt;br/&gt;evolution of dispersal rates. Of course, this model has several&lt;br/&gt;limitations. The first is the assumption that leads to the&lt;br/&gt;dispersal being represented as simple diffusion. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;wishes to understand the effects of taxis on the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between dispersal rates and spatial heterogeneity. On a more&lt;br/&gt;general level the investigator intends to replace diffusion by an&lt;br/&gt;integral kernel.&lt;br/&gt; That ecology and evolution are fundamentally influenced by&lt;br/&gt;the spatial characteristics of the environment is well accepted.&lt;br/&gt;As an example of this one may consider the paradox of diversity.&lt;br/&gt;Simple mathematical models that do not include any spatial&lt;br/&gt;component give rise to the principle of competitive exclusion:&lt;br/&gt;when two species compete for the same limited resource one of the&lt;br/&gt;species usually becomes extinct. On the other hand it is commonly&lt;br/&gt;observed that in a wide variety of habitats a multitude of&lt;br/&gt;species coexist. This can be explained, at least in part, by&lt;br/&gt;including spatial effects. Of course, once spatial components are&lt;br/&gt;introduced, dispersal rates become a central feature.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, our understanding of cause and effect in this more&lt;br/&gt;general situation is poor. The reasons for this appears to be&lt;br/&gt;fourfold. First, the number of variables in realistic ecological&lt;br/&gt;and environmental models is enormous. Second, spatial&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneities occur at all scales of the environment. Third,&lt;br/&gt;obtaining precise data for these variables from field studies is&lt;br/&gt;extremely difficult. Finally, current mathematical techniques for&lt;br/&gt;handling models that incorporate both spatial and dynamical&lt;br/&gt;properties seem to be inadequate. Given this state of affairs, a&lt;br/&gt;simple model is thoroughly investigated in the hopes of&lt;br/&gt;elucidating the basic biological principles and identifying the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental mathematical issues.</AbstractNarration>
