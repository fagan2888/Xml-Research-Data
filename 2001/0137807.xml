    <AbstractNarration>This comprehensive, project-based, inquiry-driven, middle school, science curriculum builds upon modules developed for Learning by Design at Georgia Institute of Technology and by LeTUS at the University of Michigan and Northwestern University. The latter were specifically designed for urban settings. The 15 units address national science content and process standards, focus on helping students acquire a qualitative understanding of the science principles and moves them toward a quantitative understanding. The time per unit is long enough that students can change their ideas in light of the evidence. The project develops a framework to assure complete coverage of fundamental topics. The pedagogy, use of software and the development of a scientific and collaborative culture are consistent, persistent and pervasive across the entire curriculum. The materials cover topics in physical, Earth/space and life sciences appropriate to the middle school and provide experience with diverse modes of scientific investigation -- experiment, observation, modeling, data mining, and history -- and standards of evidence are covered. Instructional technology is infused throughout and science is connected to the students' world by the use of engineering design. Assessments are embedded. The student and teacher materials are pilot tested locally and field tested more broadly. Materials for professional development of teachers are also developed.</AbstractNarration>
