    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to impact K-8 grade girls by disseminating information on gender equity issues, barriers, possibilities and role models, via radio to a national audience. Through radio WAMC will develop a weekly segment and 4 regional call-in shows for national distribution that will inform, enlighten, engage, and inspire listeners on the issues and possibilities of gender equity in the sciences for K-8 grade girls. This model will be shared nationally so that it can be replicated. WAMC will create, produce, air and distribute the weekly segments and call-in shows regionally through WAMC's 10 station-network, nationally and globally via Public Radio and ABC satellites, the Internet, mailings of CDs and the Armed Forces Radio. The Gender Equity segments will be incorporated into WAMC's award-winning radio programs "51Percent," their show concerning women's issues, and WAMC's current call-in program "Vox Pop." &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration with an Advisory Board of professional women, nationally known for their involvement with gender equity, and The Capital Area School Development Association, a study council affiliated with the School of Education at The University at Albany, SUNY, which serves as a cooperative planning and development unit through which affiliated schools and educational agencies may more effectively define and fulfill their purposes and functions in serving the educational needs of their communities. Both will assist in evaluation of the program and the Advisory Board will give input for program content. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential of reaching more than 300,000 listeners per month in WAMC's regional area alone. Additionally, "51Percent" is heard on over 125 radio stations nationally via satellite to affiliates of the ABC Radio Networks, via satellite to stations able to access the Public Radio Satellite, and on Compact Disc to stations that are not interconnected. Additionally, the program airs worldwide via the Armed Forces Radio to 133 countries, and online via the Internet through www.wamc.org, the WAMC web site and &lt;br/&gt;www.ThePublicRadioStation.com, WAMC's model non-broadcast public radio style program &lt;br/&gt;stream.</AbstractNarration>
