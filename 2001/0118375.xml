    <AbstractNarration>Following advances in information and communication technologies and the rapid evolution of E-Commerce and financial engineering during the past few years, optimization has begun to play a crucial role in sharpening the competitive edge of conventional business and organization operations. Because of the expected growth in many information related areas and what is perceived as a critical demand for focused research attention on future directions and applications of large scale simulation optimization, a workshop will be organized at Harvard University on June 23 and 24, 2001. This workshop will bring together leading government, industrial, and academic researchers and practitioners of systems simulation modeling and optimization for the purpose of identifying research issues, targets of opportunity, application areas and other unforeseen points relevant to this promising research area.</AbstractNarration>
