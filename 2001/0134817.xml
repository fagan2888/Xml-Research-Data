    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Linda H. Doerrer, Department of Chemistry, Barnard College, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for her work under a CAREER Award to investigate transition metal fluoraryloxide anions, which are relevant to industrial polymerization processes requiring weakly coordinating anions and the general field of fluorous chemistry. A second area of study involves bulky phosphine ligands that faciliate electron deficient coordination environments and the binding of small molecules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Integration of Professor Doerrer's research and education endeavors benefits from the predominantly female environment at Barnard College and an ongoing international collaboration at Oxford University that gives undergraduates at both institutions an opportunity to engage in research in an international setting. Professor Doerrer will organize and administer an outreach program for students in grades 9-12 and their teachers to learn about the emerging area of nanoscience at the Columbia University National Science and Engineering Center. The PI will also revise advanced undergraduate laboratory courses at Barnard to incorporate inorganic synthesis, and develop a new general chemistry course designed for students with generally strong high school backgrounds, but relatively weak chemistry preparation.</AbstractNarration>
