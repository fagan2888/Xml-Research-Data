    <AbstractNarration>0129062&lt;br/&gt;Gu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This one-year award in computer aided design and applications involves researchers from nine US universities in the US and seven laboratories of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and the French National Institute for Research in Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA). Keqin Gu of Southern Illinois University and Silviu-Iulian Niculescu at the University of Science and Technology in Compiegne, France are the principal organizers of this joint effort. US and French engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists will meet in a workshop format to collaborate on time-delay topics including: stability and performance issues, input-output approaches, prediction and feedback control design, and applications in energy distribution networks, computer networks, and load balancing in parallel computation. The researchers will develop new software, including a comprehensive toolbox for computer aided control systems design applicable to time delay systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration takes advantage of complementary US and French expertise in systems and control areas. Time-delay systems are present in nature, from biology models to population dynamics and from engineering to economics. The collaboration will advance understanding of these systems and their applications to a wide variety of scientific disciplines and problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigators. The CNRS will support visits by French researchers to the United States.</AbstractNarration>
