    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0140376&lt;br/&gt;PI: Xiaochun Li &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research will be conducted on a variety of problems in &lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis arising in the study of multilinea&lt;br/&gt;singular integral operators. These problems are related,&lt;br/&gt;but not limited, to the study of the Carleson operator &lt;br/&gt;and the bilinear Hilbert transform. Recently a significant&lt;br/&gt;breakthrough on the bilinear Hilbert transform was made &lt;br/&gt;by the inspiring work of Lacey and Thiele. It turns out &lt;br/&gt;that the time-frequency analysis is a powerful tool to &lt;br/&gt;solve problems related to the study of multilinear &lt;br/&gt;operators. Moreover, although this is still under &lt;br/&gt;investigation, the analysis of these problems gives us &lt;br/&gt;hopes to solve other important and difficult problems in &lt;br/&gt;the field, such as the Hilbert transform along vector fields, &lt;br/&gt;the Kakeya problem, and Carleson's maximal operator of &lt;br/&gt;the partial sums of Fourier series in two dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;It will also be very interesting to see how &lt;br/&gt;to use this delicate analysis to solve some problems in &lt;br/&gt;other fields such as partial differential equations, &lt;br/&gt;number theory, etc. Actually, multilinear operators &lt;br/&gt;have been used in the study of partial differential &lt;br/&gt;equations, since they naturally appear in series expansions &lt;br/&gt;of solutions of many equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Harmonic analysis is not only an area of theoretical &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, but also an applicable area lying at the&lt;br/&gt;heart of the intersection of fields as diverse as optics, &lt;br/&gt;signal processing, meteorology, and music. The main them&lt;br/&gt;in Harmonic analysis is about disassembling and assembling&lt;br/&gt;complicated objects into simpler well-understood pieces, &lt;br/&gt;by analogy to decomposition of intricate musical pieces &lt;br/&gt;into arrangements of a few basic notes. In signal processing,&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis is used to detect irregularities of &lt;br/&gt;signals and images. The Fouriertransform is a very useful &lt;br/&gt;tool to locate these irregularities. The appearance of a &lt;br/&gt;nonsmooth symbol inthe study of multiplier problems is &lt;br/&gt;analogous to physical phenomena where the frequencies of &lt;br/&gt;signals are altered by an abrupt operation, such as the &lt;br/&gt;interruption of radio communication or television &lt;br/&gt;transmission by meteorological phenomena. Such a sudden &lt;br/&gt;and unexpected operation causes the loss of information. &lt;br/&gt;To avoid the loss of information or to retrieve the &lt;br/&gt;original data is the main topic of the theoretical research &lt;br/&gt;proposed here.</AbstractNarration>
