    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to understand the relationship between two activities of a&lt;br/&gt;protein encoded by a group I intron. The protein facilitates a splicing reaction that excises the&lt;br/&gt;intron from its precursor RNA and also acts as a DNA endonuclease, cleaving DNA at a specific&lt;br/&gt;sequence. It is commonly believed that the RNA splicing activity evolved from a protein that&lt;br/&gt;originally functioned solely as a DNA endonuclease. However it is unlikely that this new&lt;br/&gt;function arose simply by fusion of an additional gene sequence. Preliminary evidence indicates&lt;br/&gt;that the DNA and RNA substrates bind to distinct or partially overlapping sites on the protein.&lt;br/&gt;The question then arises as to how a protein acquires a new function and how easily this can be&lt;br/&gt;detected. This is particularly relevant to annotating genomes. Attributing a single function to a&lt;br/&gt;gene may constitute only partial characterization of the sequence since an unknown number of&lt;br/&gt;proteins may "moonlight" and perform a second, unrelated and unforeseen task. Group I introns&lt;br/&gt;can catalyze their own excision from RNA precursors. An intron-encoded protein, called a&lt;br/&gt;maturase, significantly facilitates removal of such an intron in Aspergillus nidulans. It also has&lt;br/&gt;DNA endonuclease activity. The three-dimensional structure of the protein has been obtained&lt;br/&gt;with the help of a collaborator and the region which binds the cleavable DNA sequence has been&lt;br/&gt;identified. Guided by this model, the relationship between the binding sites of the RNA and&lt;br/&gt;DNA substrates will be studied biochemically and genetically. Current diffraction data from&lt;br/&gt;crystals of group I introns are of insufficient quality to reveal structural details at the atomic&lt;br/&gt;level. Co-crystallizing RNA with a protein can often solve this problem. A collaboration will be&lt;br/&gt;performed to obtain a high-resolution structure of the intron-maturase complex. This will not&lt;br/&gt;only reveal the RNA binding site on the protein and help to determine how the RNA binding site&lt;br/&gt;arose, but also provide a wealth of structural information about the group I intron RNA itself.</AbstractNarration>
