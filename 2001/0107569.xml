    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Phylogenetic analysis using ribosomal RNA structure." Ribosomal RNA genes are widely used in phylogenetics and have shaped current views of the history of life. Traditional DNA-sequence-based phylogenetic phylogenetic methods, however, fail to reliably place highly divergent sequences. This research develops probabilistic models for phylogenetics that are based on rRNA structure.</AbstractNarration>
