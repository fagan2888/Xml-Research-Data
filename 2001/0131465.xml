    <AbstractNarration>Glycogen and starch serve as major energy storage compounds for nearly all-&lt;br/&gt;living organisms and are an important energy component obtained from&lt;br/&gt;plants. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADPGlc Ppase) catalyzes the&lt;br/&gt;conversion of glucose-1-phosphate and ATP to ADP-glucose and&lt;br/&gt;pyrophosphate and is a key regulated step in both bacterial glycogen and&lt;br/&gt;plant starch biosynthesis. ADPGlc Ppase regulation is mediated by the&lt;br/&gt;binding of a number of activators and inhibitors, many of which are key&lt;br/&gt;metabolic intermediates. This research utilizes the ADPGlc Ppase enzyme&lt;br/&gt;from the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Ag.t.) that is regulated by fructose-&lt;br/&gt;6-phosphate and pyruvate. This project outlines x-ray crystal structural&lt;br/&gt;studies on Ag.t. ADPGlc Ppase to examine substrate binding, allosteric&lt;br/&gt;effector binding, and the mechanism of activation. Several roadblocks&lt;br/&gt;associated with x-ray crystallography have already been overcome including&lt;br/&gt;crystallization and heavy atom derivitization for phase determination. Once&lt;br/&gt;the three-dimensional structure of one member of the ADPGlc Ppase protein&lt;br/&gt;family is determined homology modeling can be used to construct reasonable&lt;br/&gt;structures of the other proteins in the family. As a major control point for the&lt;br/&gt;production of renewable and biodegradable carbon sources, ADPGlc Ppase&lt;br/&gt;is an attractive enzyme target for protein engineering. Understanding the&lt;br/&gt;regulation of the ADPGlc Ppase enzyme family is necessary for the&lt;br/&gt;bioengineering of the enzyme and could lead to rational protein engineering&lt;br/&gt;of the enzyme to increase starch production.</AbstractNarration>
