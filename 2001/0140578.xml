    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues study permutation and linear&lt;br/&gt;representations of finite and algebraic groups. The focus is&lt;br/&gt;on primitive permutation representations and irreducible&lt;br/&gt;linear representations. These results will be applied to&lt;br/&gt;monodromy groups of coverings of curves and higher dimensional&lt;br/&gt;varieties over finite fields and to various questions in&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic group theory. The investigator expects to make&lt;br/&gt;significant progress on outstanding conjectures about automorphism&lt;br/&gt;groups of curves in positive characteristic, the size of images&lt;br/&gt;of rational points for maps between varieties over finite fields&lt;br/&gt;and monodromy groups of coverings of curves of small genus.&lt;br/&gt;In characteristic zero, the investigator and collaborators plan&lt;br/&gt;to obtain a complete classification of the possible monodromy&lt;br/&gt;groups of indecomposable rational functions. This is a much&lt;br/&gt;more ambitious project than the solution of the Guralnick-Thompson&lt;br/&gt;conjecture that was recently solved. The techniques involve&lt;br/&gt;detailed analysis of properties of simple groups and translating&lt;br/&gt;problems in arithmetic algebraic geometry to group theory.&lt;br/&gt;Many of these results will give detailed information about&lt;br/&gt;questions in probabilistic group theory as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the classification of finite simple groups was announced&lt;br/&gt;in the late 1970's, there have been some remarkable applications&lt;br/&gt;of this theorem in many areas of mathematics. This proposal&lt;br/&gt;continues in this tradition. There is also a long history of&lt;br/&gt;translating problems in number theory and geometry (particularly&lt;br/&gt;over finite fields) to group theory. The investigator intends&lt;br/&gt;to obtain quite detailed results about finite simple groups&lt;br/&gt;and their subgroups. Some of the investigation into finite simple&lt;br/&gt;groups is quite natural but other aspects are motivated by applications&lt;br/&gt;to curves and varieties over finite fields. This will give insight into&lt;br/&gt;various problems about maps over finite fields -- in particular, about&lt;br/&gt;polynomials and rational functions. This has applications to&lt;br/&gt;coding theory and cryptography as well as answering basic&lt;br/&gt;questions in the field. A special case of this is the study&lt;br/&gt;of "exceptional" polynomials. These were first studied by&lt;br/&gt;Dickson in his thesis in the 1890's. The major result in&lt;br/&gt;the area, using the classification of simple groups, was only&lt;br/&gt;obtained in 1993 by Fried, Saxl and the proposer. The investigator&lt;br/&gt;intends to classify all such polynomials. These results about&lt;br/&gt;simple groups will also give detailed information about probabilistic&lt;br/&gt;generation of finite groups. These kinds of questions have become&lt;br/&gt;increasingly important in the design of algorithms in computational&lt;br/&gt;algebra. These results show that by following certain recipes, one&lt;br/&gt;can be reasonably sure of picking a generating set for your&lt;br/&gt;favorite finite group.</AbstractNarration>
