    <AbstractNarration>OPTIONS is a demonstration project designed to create small-scale learning communities that assist girls in achieving in advanced science and mathematics courses at the high school level, and encourage them to pursue science and math college degrees and business careers. The project targets high school girls, who have demonstrated average to above average abilities in math and science and who are enrolled in one of the seven Shelby County Schools (SCS) high schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the OPTIONS program, 70 students per year for four years are forming learning communities. Teachers are studying how to craft proactive approaches to math and science for girls. The objectives of the program are to: 1 ) increase the interest, confidence, knowledge and test scores of girls in science and math concentrations 2) train high school math and science teachers and guidance counselors in gender-equitable approaches to decrease barriers and assist to aid girls in pursuing science and math majors or careers; and 3) increase the number of all students who plan to enroll in classes, choose college majors, or pursue careers in science or math related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to obtain the objectives, SCS is creating learning communities of students, teachers, and mentors who engage in specific after school, professional development, and summer camp activities. The program includes professional development workshops to modify teacher and counselor attitudes and skills; project-based, problem-solving exercises to stimulate girls interest in science and math; mentoring by professional women; exploration of college options; and internships at local corporations and organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has broad implications. For educators, OPTIONS will identify factors for women that inhibit their academic pursuits and career choices in science and math areas, and begin building new approaches to encourage those choices. Participating female high school students will achieve a new understanding of the vast opportunities available in science and math-related industries and learn to work in a small group to solve real world problems. Corporations that rely on these disciplines will interact with educators in the design and evaluation of industry specific intern programs to prepare the next generation of workers and to generate enthusiasm for that work. Schools, school systems, and local communities will benefit from the increased emphasis on science and math classes and the career opportunities that come from that focus.</AbstractNarration>
