    <AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this research is development of a piezoelectric-based cochlear implant, while complementing research in existing implant technology and to the understanding of hearing processes. The device will utilize the incoming mechanical energy into the cochlea to generate electrical charge by virtue of the piezoelectric effect, and stimulate surviving nerve fibers in the cochlea. Another goal will be to overcome challenges in the fabrication of miniature piezoelectric devices, and gain insights into their properties. Compared to currently used cochlear implants, this unit is self-contained and designed to work without any signal amplifiers or transmission elements, greatly simplifying the stimulation process. A considerable amount of background research has already been performed in our laboratories, both in vivo and in vitro. Results have demonstrated feasibility, and have indicated the need to focus on device analysis and development. A device utilizing bending mode piezoelectricity has been designed. The design is flexible, allowing a number of engineering parameters to be varied to obtain optimum performance. Specific aims of the proposed research are to: a) determine the dynamic acoustical piezoelectric properties of PVDF in the bending mode; b) systematically evaluate device performance as a function of engineering variables; c) perform in vitro testing in a mechanical model of the cochlea; and, d) study the nature of mechanical forces in the cochlea to enhance transducer performance. Research will involve collaborations with acoustics, biophysics and polymer surface treatment specialists to improve upon the initial efforts and bring to fruition an implantable device.</AbstractNarration>
