    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses the development of an ultrafast TOC analyzer to enable real-time recycling of spent rinse waters from semiconductor wet benches. At the present time, semiconductor fabrication facilities generate about 3800 gallons of wastewater discharge per wafer, which is equivalent to 53 million gallons of wastewater per year for facilities operating at 100 gpm (gallons per minute). Recycling spent rinse waters from semiconductor wet benches provides a viable solution to dramatically reduce the environmental impact of this manufacturing process. On-line monitoring of key contaminants in real time is necessary to successfully operate future water systems having recycle and reuse capabilities. Phase I research will be directed at developing microfluidic sensors having reliable, ultra-fast response times to trace concentrations of organic contaminants found in spent r5inse waters from simiconductor wet benches. Specific performance goals for Phase I devices include: &lt;30 s response time, &lt;30 ppb detection limit, operation in &lt;10 microSiemen/cm water conductivity, and 100% +/- 30% recovery of key contaminants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An ultra-fast TOC analyzer will be developed that enables real-time recycling of water used by seimiconductor manufacturing to reduce their demand upon regional water supplies. This novel instrument will find widespread applications in the semiconductor industry as well as other manufacturing environments that require real-time detection of organic contaminants in aqueous effluent.</AbstractNarration>
