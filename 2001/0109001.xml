    <AbstractNarration>Hoppensteadt&lt;br/&gt;0109001&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleague study the relation&lt;br/&gt;between bifurcations in neural dynamics and electrophysiological&lt;br/&gt;features of neurons. There is growing understanding of the role&lt;br/&gt;of bifurcations in neuron dynamics. Indeed, knowledge of all&lt;br/&gt;bifurcations in a neuron model can explain some features of&lt;br/&gt;neuron activity, such as the existence of oscillatory potentials,&lt;br/&gt;synchronization, bursting, excitability, etc., without knowing&lt;br/&gt;electrophysiological details. However, there is little&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the relationship between electrophysiology and&lt;br/&gt;bifurcations in neural dynamics. For example, why do certain&lt;br/&gt;ionic currents or combinations of them result in an Andronov-Hopf&lt;br/&gt;bifurcation but not a saddle-node on limit cycle bifurcation?&lt;br/&gt;(These two types of bifurcations describe Hodgkin's&lt;br/&gt;classification of excitable neurons.) Over 100 different kinds&lt;br/&gt;of recognizable bifurcations result in bursting patterns of&lt;br/&gt;activity. A key question is whether or not one can determine for&lt;br/&gt;a given type of bursting activity what combinations of ionic&lt;br/&gt;currents must (or must not) be involved. The investigator and his&lt;br/&gt;colleague introduce here a notion of minimal electrophysiological&lt;br/&gt;models classified by voltage gated, second messenger gated, and&lt;br/&gt;variable Nernst potentials. They map this classification onto the&lt;br/&gt;existing classification of bifurcation mechanisms in neuron&lt;br/&gt;dynamics. This yields a deeper understanding of nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dynamics of electrophysiological systems.&lt;br/&gt; How does a brain encode and process information?&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics has played an important role in studies of this&lt;br/&gt;problem to date by creating methods for analyzing results&lt;br/&gt;obtained by life science and medical researchers. There is a&lt;br/&gt;well-developed electrophysiological theory of how neural tissue&lt;br/&gt;can sustain and propagate electrical activity using ionic&lt;br/&gt;currents. At the same time there is an emerging mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theory based on canonical models of bifurcations, which are&lt;br/&gt;observable changes in a biological preparation in response to&lt;br/&gt;stimulation. This project brings these two lines of inquiry&lt;br/&gt;together by classifying dynamical systems (mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structures) in terms that are consistent with electrophysiology.&lt;br/&gt;The result is a deeper understanding of nonlinear phenomena in&lt;br/&gt;electrophysiological systems.</AbstractNarration>
