    <AbstractNarration>This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University Alabama at Birmingham. Tracy Hamilton is the site's Program Director. Eight faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. Recruitment efforts will be focused through the close links that the Department of Chemistry has developed with regional HBCUs. The REU group of students will meet weekly for progress reporting and for visits to local cultural and historical sites of interest. The summer program will conclude with a poster session. Evaluation of the program will be the number of refereed publications with student co-authors and the number of students going to graduate school.</AbstractNarration>
