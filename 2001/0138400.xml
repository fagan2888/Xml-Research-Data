    <AbstractNarration>0138400&lt;br/&gt;Jiles &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports the US-India cooperative research entitled Magnetic Evaluation of Fatigue Damage and Deformation. Collaborators David Jiles, Iowa State University and Amitava Mitra, National Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur will conduct advanced Non-Destructive Evaluations (NDE) to obtain measurements on the structure of materials at the micrometer scale by using magnetic force microscopy and scanning Hall sensor microscopy. These will improve understanding of the relationships between microstructure and magnetic properties, which can then be used to interpret the results of traditional magnetic NDE measurements. The measurement data will be analyzed through mathematical modeling of the magnetization processes in materials using a new approach to the magnetic Preisach model. The research goal is to obtain specific details on how magnetic inspection methods can reliably be used to infer changes in structure and stress states during fatigue and deformation processes. This will greatly enhance the predictive capabilities of magnetic inspection techniques for estimating the remaining lifetime of components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The idea that magnetic measurements could determine fatigue damage and deformation in materials has great potential and high relevance for the scientific community of engineers and materials scientists. For society, detection of impending failure in components could have significant impact for civil, aerospace, and mechanical structures. Jiles is the authority in the United States on using magnetic methods for NDE. The collaboration with the Indian scientists at National Metallurgical Laboratory will leverage the strengths of both laboratories. Under this grant, two US graduate students will have the opportunity to participate in the experimental work at the National Metallurgical Laboratory in Jamshedpur. This project is supported by the Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST) and by NSF's Office of International Science &amp; Engineering and the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems.</AbstractNarration>
