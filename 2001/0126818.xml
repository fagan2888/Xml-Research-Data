    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the "history approach" to teach an overview course in computer science for non-majors. History is an ongoing theme throughout the course through the adaptation of relevant historical materials. Where appropriate, the project leaders are developing digital conversion of materials to enhance the course delivery. The project team is working closely with the Charles Babbage Institute, the Computer Museum History Center, the IEEE History Center, and the Computing History Center at Virginia Tech. Each of these centers has already identified, preserved, and in many cases catalogued a vast quantity of the exemplary materials pertaining to computing history. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team is also creating a dedicated website solely for this activity. Students will have direct access to digitized material emanating from this project, to the collection of course-related historical materials, and to links to other useful and related sites. The expectation is that there will be a dramatic change in the course from one of sterile factual content to one containing dynamic interludes involving people, places, and events. In this manner, the computing course for non-majors will be much more interesting. It will stimulate more students to consider computing as their major, will contribute to students' life-long learning experiences, will encourage students from diverse and minority communities to appreciate computing, and will increase student retention. Students will also gain a better sense of the nature of inquiry, the processes of innovation, the constraining and driving factors involved, and the human dimension.</AbstractNarration>
