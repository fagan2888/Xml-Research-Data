    <AbstractNarration>This project is mainly concerned with the study of the regularity of&lt;br/&gt;solutions of partial differential equations that arise in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;several complex variables and on CR manifolds. In particular we plan to&lt;br/&gt;study various properties of subelliptic multipliers and also&lt;br/&gt;hypoellipticity when subellipticity fails. Related questions are Hoelder&lt;br/&gt;continuity and real analyticity of solutions. We also will continue our&lt;br/&gt;study of global regularity on CR manifolds using microlocal methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial differential equations arise naturally in physics, chemistry,&lt;br/&gt;engineering, economics, and in several diverse areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;Sometimes these equations can be solved explicitly but more often they&lt;br/&gt;cannot and, in that case, the problem is to find whether the solution&lt;br/&gt;exists and if so to find various of its properties and to approximate&lt;br/&gt;it. This is accomplished by means of estimates. Here we study estimates&lt;br/&gt;for certain special fundamental partial differential equations but the&lt;br/&gt;techniques we develop are applicable in much greater generality. The&lt;br/&gt;basic concept that we use are "subelliptic multipliers" this is a tool&lt;br/&gt;which converts the search for estimates into problems of algebra and&lt;br/&gt;geometry. This concept has proved very effective not only in proving&lt;br/&gt;estimates but also in the study of various algebraic and geometric&lt;br/&gt;problems.</AbstractNarration>
