    <AbstractNarration>0132036&lt;br/&gt;Bromwich&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award will provide funds for the support of a planning workshop for the Ross Island Meteorology Experiment, a project to integrate the results of advanced research techniques into antarctic weather forecasting. The workshop will be held at the Byrd Polar Research Center of Ohio State University, in September 2001.&lt;br/&gt; The objective of the workshop is to bring together the atmospheric community with research interests in antarctic synoptic meteorology. This group, which will include operational forecasters, numerical modelers, atmospheric scientists, and others, will be expected to define and recommend realizable goals for the synoptic meteorology program of the U.S. Antarctic Program, and to define the core requirements of research project in the McMurdo Sound/Ross Ice Shelf area which will achieve these goals.&lt;br/&gt; Recent advances in polar numerical weather prediction, resulting from ongoing efforts at improving the capabilities of numerical weather prediction models for use in polar regions, and real-time simulations of the antarctic atmosphere using the Penn State University/National Center for Atmospheric Research fifth generation mesoscale model have placed the field of antarctic weather prediction at the brink of a period of rapid improvement. This potential can only be realized through a directed research program with the goal of providing an observational database to validate the modeling effort.&lt;br/&gt; The need for this workshop was recognized and articulated at the Antarctic Weather Forecasting Workshop held at Ohio State University in May 2000.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
