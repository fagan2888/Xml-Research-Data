    <AbstractNarration>The central theme of this proposal is the development of &lt;br/&gt;new methods for approximately solving the Schroedinger&lt;br/&gt;equation for atomic nuclei and their application to problems of&lt;br/&gt;contemporary importance in nuclear structure physics. Methods &lt;br/&gt;having their parentage in the nuclear shell model and in &lt;br/&gt;mean-field theory will be considered, with the goal of developing &lt;br/&gt;algorithms that significantly expand their ranges of applicability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A principal focus will be on the development of the&lt;br/&gt;Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG), a method &lt;br/&gt;first introduced in the context of quantum spin lattices. &lt;br/&gt;Here we will focus on a new DMRG methodology that is tailored &lt;br/&gt;to such finite fermi systems as the atomic nucleus. We will also &lt;br/&gt;consider its application to an important non-nuclear problem, the &lt;br/&gt;two-dimensional Hubbard model, which is of relevance to systems &lt;br/&gt;that undergo transitions to superconductivity at high critical &lt;br/&gt;temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second focus will be on the properties of&lt;br/&gt;weakly-bound nuclei far from stability. A method recently &lt;br/&gt;proposed for reliably solving the Hartree Fock Bogolyubov &lt;br/&gt;mean-field equations for very weakly-bound nuclei will be &lt;br/&gt;developed further, so as to make it computationally more viable, &lt;br/&gt;and will then be applied systematically to both spherical and &lt;br/&gt;axially-deformed nuclei throughout the periodic table. Other &lt;br/&gt;methods for solving the Hartree Fock Bogolyubov equations in &lt;br/&gt;weakly-bound systems will also be considered, to make sure &lt;br/&gt;that the spatial properties of such systems are being reliably &lt;br/&gt;treated.</AbstractNarration>
