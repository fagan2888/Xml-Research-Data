    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test new methods to detect and distinguish similar strains of the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae. Ninety-five percent of systemic infections in childhood are caused by H. influenzae strains of the serotype b. They include meningitis, sepsis, epiglottitis, pneumonia and otitis media. Bacterial meningitis and epiglottitis are life-threatening diseases with a lethality of five percent to twenty-five percent. Thus, a real-time sensor capable of detecting specific strains of H. influenzae in the parts-per-trillion range is needed. Any new detection device must be highly sensitive and selective, miniature, self-diagnostic, low cost, have rapid response time, and require no sample preparation. This Phase I project proposes such a novel point-of-care detection device for highly sensitive determination of H. influenzae and other bacteria strains. This approach builds on recent research conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory using microcantilevers as sensor platforms. The BioTELL sensor will consist of an array of microcantilevers with one surface derivatized by an antibody coating receptive to H. influenzae antigens.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial applications of this project will be in the biosensor market for detection of H. influenzae and other disease causing microorganisms. The primary customers for products developed through this project are expected to include pediatricians, general practitioners and consumer households.</AbstractNarration>
