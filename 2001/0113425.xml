    <AbstractNarration>Internet is undergoing an overhaul unprecedented in size, diversity, and reach, with profound im-&lt;br/&gt;pact in all aspects of our scientific, social, economic and political life through the integration of&lt;br/&gt;networks of communication, transportation, entertainment, utilities, and finance. The stability&lt;br/&gt;and robustness of this vital infrastructure demands a rigorous theory to understand the current&lt;br/&gt;protocols and evolve them to meet emerging challenges. We propose to develop such a theory for&lt;br/&gt;TCP congestion control, and use it to drastically improve the stability, robustness and optimality&lt;br/&gt;of the current protocols.&lt;br/&gt;A key insight is to view congestion control as a distributed asynchronous computation to maxi-&lt;br/&gt;mize aggregate source utility over the Internet; different TCP and active queue management (AQM)&lt;br/&gt;schemes correspond to different utility functions and different algorithms to maximize them.&lt;br/&gt;Our research hastwo components. First, we will develop a new theoretical model of TCP&lt;br/&gt;congestion control based on duality in optimization and multivariate robust control. The theory will&lt;br/&gt;clarify the role of source algorithms, such as Tahoe, Reno and Vegas, and active queue management,&lt;br/&gt;such as DropTail, RED and REM, in the control of networks and establish performance limits of&lt;br/&gt;the current protocols; it will explain the effect on stability when delay, topology, capacity, and load&lt;br/&gt;scale up; and it will provide conditions under which the feedback stability ofTCP/AQM algorithms&lt;br/&gt;are invariant to these effects. Indeed, such a theory is already emerging from our recent works.&lt;br/&gt;Even in its currently preliminary stage, it already provides a fundamental understanding on some&lt;br/&gt;widely observed performance and fairness behavior of the current protocols, and uncovers new and&lt;br/&gt;surprising stability problems. For example, it shows that the current protocols become unstable and&lt;br/&gt;exhibit bifurcation when network capacity increases. Moreover, maintaining stability as capacity&lt;br/&gt;scales up arbitrarily imposes severe constraints on how sources adjust their rates (TCP) and what&lt;br/&gt;congestion information is fed back (AQM). The current protocol does not satisfy the condition&lt;br/&gt;for such stability invariance, and hence may be ill suited for future networks where, pulled by&lt;br/&gt;application demand and pushed by technological advances, the capacity will be large.&lt;br/&gt;The second component of our research is the design of practical TCP and AQM protocols&lt;br/&gt;based on the theory, and the development of prototypes and experiments to demonstrate their&lt;br/&gt;effectiveness. We will use the theory to identify the sources of instability in the current protocols&lt;br/&gt;when delay, network size, capacity, and traffic load scale up. We will design both enhancements that&lt;br/&gt;incrementally evolve the current protocols, and drastically new protocols that have the strongly&lt;br/&gt;robust stability property promised by theory. As a concrete application of our algorithms, we will&lt;br/&gt;apply them to improve TCP performance over wireless links, both because they are ubiquitous and&lt;br/&gt;because they are likely to remain the most important bottlenecks in future networks.</AbstractNarration>
