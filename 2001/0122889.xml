    <AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;This project provides 29 scholarships per year to talented low-income students in computer science and mathematics. The project encourages community college (CC) graduates with AS degrees to continue their education through the BS degree. The scholarships are used as a recruiting tool to attract students to computer science and mathematics. Four categories of scholarships are offered for CS and Mathematics students: (1) four-year scholarships for incoming first-year students (offered during year one of the project), (2) two-year scholarships for CC transfer students (offered during the first three years of the project), &lt;br/&gt;(3) two-year scholarships for CS graduate students (offered during the first three years of the project), and (4) one-year scholarships (offered in the first and last years of the project).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients are selected on the basis of financial need, according to established guidelines, and according to ability, based upon GPA, standard test scores, demonstrated professional ability, and overall class ranking. For retention, existing student support programs are used and expanded, including supplemental instruction, tutoring, internship placement, and career placement. Students also have access to clubs and organizations that offer mutual support, including: chapters of ACM, IEEE, and MAA; Upsilon Pi Epsilon (CS) and Pi Mu Epsilon (mathematics) honor societies; an active mathematics club; and a local student-led Unix users group.</AbstractNarration>
