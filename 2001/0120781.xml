    <AbstractNarration>This study investigates the impact of interpersonal and interorganizational networks on the formation of high technology strategic alliances in two countries: the United States and Israel. The project significantly expands the purview of prior work, making use of a model recognizing that different exchanges create two types of relationships - interpersonal and interorganizational - which represent the starting points for network formation processes reported by Doz, Olk &amp; Ring (2000). This study extends that research by examining the relevance of variations in interpersonal and organizational networks for strategic alliance development, examining organizational relationships in terms of prior and current relationships; and interpersonal relationships both in terms of formal, role-based relationships and informal friendship ties, and their relationship with strategic alliance characteristics. The study will control for the influence of the alliance's technology, the strategic interests and organizational characteristics of the partners and the institutional settings, while examining these networks' relationship to the performance of the strategic alliance.&lt;br/&gt;The study focuses on two of the world's extremely high-growth high technology communities of similar size and growth rates, Colorado and Israel, taking advantage of the formation of some 40 strategic alliances in the immediate vicinity of two institutions - the University of Denver and the Technion - with relationships to the communities. It is anticipated that this study will be the first, pilot stage of an eventual multi-stage project.</AbstractNarration>
