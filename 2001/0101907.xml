    <AbstractNarration>Submitted under the NSF 00-99 guidelines for Teacher Enhancement: Mathematics and Science Courses for Improving Teacher Qualifications, the primary purpose is to develop six courses for middle-school mathematics teachers during this thirty-nine month project. The targeted geographic area is the Delmarva region in the states of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. There are forty-five middle schools in the area and over 500 middle-school teachers. Six professors will each develop a course for middle school teachers. There are three objectives for the project: 1) to develop six credit-bearing, interconnected graduate courses in mathematics for middle-school teachers to foster a deep understanding of fundamental mathematics; 2) to implement the mathematics in the teachers' schools, reflect on their experiences and modify their teaching; 3) to reduce the anxieties which teachers experience due to their insufficient mathematical backgrounds, and thus improve their confidence. The courses will be delivered in an incremental manner.</AbstractNarration>
