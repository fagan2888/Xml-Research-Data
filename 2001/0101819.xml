    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to advance the state of multi-agent processing for intelligent, adaptive biomedical monitoring systems. Adaptive reasoning will align with an agent's mission and guide agent monitoring of aspects of a target environment--comprised of base models with interjected instrumentation readings. Base models are infused with "live" interactive data and decision functionality embedded within multiple, autonomous agents, which determine actions, set off alerts and export state. Experimentation will involve exploring the most effective guidance capabilities from genetically programmed agents and adaptive neural networks, in combination with a supportive knowledge base. While the approach has broad application possibilities, it has specific implications for supplemental assistance to medical personnel inundated with information. This project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate students to become actively involved in a growing area of computer science research.</AbstractNarration>
