    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the acquisition of a SQUID magnetometer will enable students and researchers at Northeastern University to study the physics, chemistry, and engineering of new materials and structures. The multiuser instrument from Quantum Design (model MPMS) has the capability of measuring magnetization and AC susceptibility in magnetic fields to 5 T, from 1.9 to 400 K. It has high sensitivity (10-8 emu) required for measuring small MBE-grown samples. The instrument will be used for: (i) student education in electronics courses; (ii) characterizing the synthesis of improved ferromagnetic semiconductors; (iii) investigating magnetism and superconductivity in molecules, low-D materials, magnetic oxides, semiconductors, and ferrites; and (iv) training in materials science research. Students will perform and analyze most of the measurements.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program, Northeastern University will be able to acquire a SQUID magnetometer enables students and researchers at Northeastern University to study the physics, chemistry, and engineering of new materials and structures. The multiuser instrument has the capability of measuring the magnetic properties of novel materials with high sensitivity. The instrument will be used for: (i) student education in electronics courses; (ii) studying the properties of materials for future "spintronic" and "quantum computing" applications; (iii) investigating superconductivity and magnetism in molecules and semiconductors; and (iv) training in materials science research. Students will perform and analyze most of the measurements. The intellectually challenging and technologically important projects could strengthen our knowledge base and impact future device technology</AbstractNarration>
