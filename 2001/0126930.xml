    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the acquisition of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer, we are incorporating MS techniques into our undergraduate chemistry curriculum. Over the last 20 years the ability to analyze large involatile molecules by mass spectrometry has grown to the extent that it is now a common technique. In order to introduce the use of this research tool to our students, we are adapting, implementing, and developing disciplinary and interdisciplinary projects into the General, Organic, Biochemistry and "Problems in Chemistry" laboratory courses at Mercer University. We are adapting these experiments into our discovery-based pedagogy to further enhance student learning. In addition to the laboratory courses, we are using the instrument in ongoing student-faculty research projects. The incorporation of MALDI-TOF-MS into the curriculum has permitted us to analyze involatile species, including proteins and clusters. Our students are first introduced to the MS technique during their first semester of General chemistry by studying the concepts of isotopes and average molecular mass. Students then continue their study of MALDI techniques by performing individual and group experiments in Organic chemistry and Biochemistry courses. Finally, they gain a significant laboratory experience in the application of MS in the capstone "Problems in Chemistry" laboratory sequence. In addition, students interested in organic synthesis and biochemical research continue to use the instrumentation in a number of ongoing student-faculty research projects. Our ultimate goal is to further utilize this instrument throughout our curriculum and generate laboratory exercises that demonstrate the utility of this modern technique at the undergraduate level.</AbstractNarration>
