    <AbstractNarration>0128922&lt;br/&gt;Gandolfi&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of American scientists in a U.S.-Japan seminar on arsenic in biology and medicine to be held in Honolulu, Hawaii from December 15-20, 2002. The co-organizers are Professor A. Jay Gandolfi at the University of Arizona and Professor Kazuo Suzuki of Chiba University in Japan. Arsenic is a toxicant of worldwide concern. Arsenic causes a range of toxic effect and is classed as a human carcinogen. Arsenic can be present naturally in soil and water or can be released into our environment by man's activities (e.g.mining). It appears in various oxidation states as both inorganic and organic forms. Each of these has distinct toxicological properties. Arsenic exposure can also be by ingestion (water, food) and inhalation (dust). Being an element, arsenic cannot be destroyed and must be contained to control its toxic exposures. The goals of the meeting are to: A) discuss the dose-response relationship for cancer and non-cancer endpoints for target organs of arsenic toxicity; B) determine the low-level dose-response effects for arsenic at concentrations relevant to those expected from arsenic contaminated drinking water; C) evaluate in vitro models of arsenic-induced molecular toxicity and comparison of these results with those seen in arsenic-exposed populations; and D) clarify whether there is a linear dose-response relationship for arsenic or if there is a threshold dose-response (a non-linear response). Specific topics for discussion are: 1) chronic arsenism caused by underground water; 2) chemical forms of arsenic and its metabolism; 3) mechanisms underlying the toxicity of arsenic; 4) mechanisms underlying the carcinogenicity of arsenic; 5) organ-specific toxicity of arsenic; 6) animal species-specific metabolism and toxicity of arsenic; 7) interaction of arsenic with other biological elements; 8) excretion and removal of arsenic (antidote to arsenism); 9) safety dose for chronic ingestion of arsenic; and 10) genetic polymorphism and arsenic toxicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concerns about the acceptable levels of arsenic in our environment are sweeping the world. Arsenic toxicity and carcinogenicity represent one of the big challenges for researchers in the new millennium. The recent efforts to change the drinking water standards for arsenic has stimulated numerous research investigations. Since a majority of the investigations have been performed in the United States and Japan it is very timely to convene this joint meeting to share these studies. The project advances international human resources through the participation of a postdoc and graduate students. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation. The researchers plan to publish proceedings of the seminar in a journal such as "Environmental Health Perspectives."</AbstractNarration>
