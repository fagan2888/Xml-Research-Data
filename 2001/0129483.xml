    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this workshop is to gather for the fourth time, a diverse group of leading researchers in solid state technology, devices, circuits, and system architectures to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assess the change in the knowledge base since 1999&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interact in an open discussion and free exchange of ideas across the broad spectrum of communication/information processing technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Identify areas on the research frontiers that extend communication/information processing progress into&lt;br/&gt;the 21 st Century and beyond shrink limitation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establish a communication link between researchers from around the world from different disciplines&lt;br/&gt;and backgrounds for a fruitful exchange of experiences and ideas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As the cost and performance factors of microelectronic devices improve through advances in technology,&lt;br/&gt;novel and/or improved information/communication systems are enabled. Conversely, new concepts for&lt;br/&gt;information/communications applications often create a demand for more advanced microelectronics&lt;br/&gt;technologies that offer unique capabilities. As an example, the need for mobility has driven the creation of&lt;br/&gt;high performance, low power, microelectronic devices used in portable electronic assistants with&lt;br/&gt;communication capabilities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the 4th IWFIPT is to examine the push and pull between microelectronics technology and&lt;br/&gt;emerging application areas to obtain a sense of future technology trends and capabilities. Leading&lt;br/&gt;contributors will describe their views on hardware performance and functionalities needed in the&lt;br/&gt;information society of the future. These projections will be juxtaposed with anticipated trends in&lt;br/&gt;microelectronics and with potential ioradical technologiesli arising from advances in carbon-based materials,&lt;br/&gt;quantum physics, molecular nanotechnology and other areas. A synthesis of views is planned to identify&lt;br/&gt;trend feeding, trend fighting and trend setting microelectronic technologies that are likely to emerge over&lt;br/&gt;the next few decades.</AbstractNarration>
