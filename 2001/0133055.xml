    <AbstractNarration>Metcalfe's law states that the "value" of a network increases with the square of the number of users.&lt;br/&gt;However, for most applications, as the number of participants increases, performance degrades, and&lt;br/&gt;so too does the value of application to the user. Centralized service and application architectures&lt;br/&gt;are most at risk for not maintaining performance with an increasing user base. Centralized sites can&lt;br/&gt;represent a processing bottleneck, a single point of failure, or single point ofattack. Furthermore,&lt;br/&gt;a single server cannot mitigate for client's poor network conditions in third-party domains. Repli-&lt;br/&gt;cating and distributing servers is one solution for solving the problems of centralized architectures.&lt;br/&gt; Peer-to-peer services take distribution even further by using collaborative clients who are pre-&lt;br/&gt;pared and expected to perform some or all the functions of servers. As new clients bring new load&lt;br/&gt;to the systems, they also bring new resources. Thus, peer-to-peer, collaborative services can be a&lt;br/&gt;powerful paradigm: if on average clients bring enough or more than enough resources to balance&lt;br/&gt;the load and cost they incur, then peer-to-peer services can increase in value and performance with&lt;br/&gt;the number of participants.&lt;br/&gt; The primary purpose of this proposal is to make fundamental advances in the understanding and&lt;br/&gt;design of applications and services that make use of replication and collaboration in a peer-to-peer&lt;br/&gt;environment. Opportunities for the application of peer-to-peer techniques in new disciplines seem&lt;br/&gt;limitless. I propose to examine several applications that are only possible, or achieve their best&lt;br/&gt;performance, using peer-to-peer architectures and not centralized architectures. These include the&lt;br/&gt;novel peer-to-peer applications of anonymity, secure ad-hoc routing, mobility-based transport for&lt;br/&gt;wearable computers, cheat-proof serverless gaming, and distributed information retrieval.&lt;br/&gt; There are commonalities to all the numerous peer-to-peer applications we will study: the ex-&lt;br/&gt;istence of heterogeneous peer resources, redundancy of offered services at peers, and replication of&lt;br/&gt;application data and content. By addressing these issues, the researcher will make important advances in discovery and understanding of peer-to-peer networking and by applying those results to a diverse set&lt;br/&gt;of problem areas, the researcher's work will make a broader impact in in fields as diverse as security (privacy, availability, and secure routing), mobile computing, wearable computing, multimedia and gaming,&lt;br/&gt;and distributed information retrieval.&lt;br/&gt; The major theme of the researcher's proposed educational activities is the involvement of undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;in original research. The goal of the educational proposal is to prepare undergraduate students&lt;br/&gt;for graduate school by providing them with an early opportunity toperform research. It consists&lt;br/&gt;of an integrated plan of publishable undergraduate research projects, new course curriculum, the&lt;br/&gt;development of practical lab exercises in networking and network security, distance learning, and&lt;br/&gt;minority outreach.&lt;br/&gt; By focusing the research of undergraduates on the themes of this proposal, the researcher is ensuring a&lt;br/&gt;number of benefits. First, that the impact of this educational component is tightly integrated with&lt;br/&gt;my research objectives. Second, by coordinating efforts with the director of the Northeast Alliance&lt;br/&gt;for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NEAGEP), the researcher will improve minority outreach in&lt;br/&gt;the department by preparing and encouraging under-represented minority students to continue on&lt;br/&gt;for doctoral programs at UMass and other universities. Third, the researcher will advance the department's&lt;br/&gt;teaching mission by providing a new three-course curriculum of networking and security. Fourth,&lt;br/&gt;the researcher will produce a standard set of practical laboratory exercises in networking and network security to be used at any university. Finally, the availability ofmy curriculum and practical exercises, as&lt;br/&gt;well as UMass's existing Video Instruction Program and MANIC distance learning programs, will&lt;br/&gt;increase the external impact of the curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
