    <AbstractNarration>0115884&lt;br/&gt;Melchiorre&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant, made through the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, provides partial support to purchase a Finnigan MAT DELTAplus stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer with GasBench II. This equipment will be a key part of our Environmental, Hydrology, and Geochemistry program for both undergraduate research and the research of the P.I. Instrumentation will be housed within the newly renovated $32 million Julian Science and Mathematics Building at Depauw University. The requested equipment will serve growing student interest in environmental geochemistry as well as ongoing collaborative research on acid mine drainage and basin hydrology with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). The P.I., his students, and colleagues will also utilize the spectrometer for research on deep basin groundwater and formation fluid migration. Ongoing projects with significant student involvement includes studies of contaminant transport from acid mine drainage sites within Indiana (with IDNR and IGS), studies of surface water/groundwater interactions in the Wolf-Red (Wisconsin) and Tippecanoe-Wabash (Indiana) watersheds, isotopic studies of groundwater systems in fracture-flow and karst environments in southern Indiana, and studies of tectonic-driven formation fluid migration in California. Faculty at DePauw University with separate funding will make significant use of the laboratory to examine fluvial sediment transport and systematics and to participate in the Indiana Riverwatch Program. As a member of both the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES) and the Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), the P.I. is firmly committed to promoting student participation for those groups traditionally underrepresented in the Earth Sciences. This commitment is echoed and supported by DePauw University, and efforts are underway to link the environmental stable isotope laboratory with DePauw's Women in Science Program and to participate in projects with Native American Tribal Colleges in evaluating the isotope hydrology of the Red-Wolf river basin of Wisconsin. This environmental stable isotope facility will be open to in house use as well as outside students and colleagues.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
