    <AbstractNarration>We propose to organize yearly, intensive six-week research workshops&lt;br/&gt;at Johns Hopkins University, focusing on Language Engineering,&lt;br/&gt;including the mutually related areas of automatic speech recognition&lt;br/&gt;and synthesis, natural language processing, machine translation,&lt;br/&gt;information extraction and summarization. Applications of language&lt;br/&gt;engineering techniques to other domains such as language instruction&lt;br/&gt;or bioinformatics will also be appropriate workshop topics. These&lt;br/&gt;workshops will bring together teams of leading professionals and&lt;br/&gt;graduate and undergraduate students in a cooperative effort to&lt;br/&gt;advance the state of the art. The first goal of the proposed workshop&lt;br/&gt;series is to establish new research directions in Language Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;The second goal is to attract students to the field and to offer&lt;br/&gt;them an intensive hands-on mentored research education. The third&lt;br/&gt;is to engender extensive cross-fertilization between researchers&lt;br/&gt;distributed across industrial, academic and government institutions,&lt;br/&gt;forging intensive links in the 6-week summer period and offering&lt;br/&gt;a shared research environment for follow-on collaborative work.&lt;br/&gt;To ensure that the projects address current problems in the state&lt;br/&gt;of the art, each year an open call for workshop project proposals&lt;br/&gt;will be issued to researchers in the worldwide language engineering&lt;br/&gt;community. The proposals received will be evaluated competitively&lt;br/&gt;at planning meetings held each year. The meetings will draw together&lt;br/&gt;project proponents, government representatives, and experts from&lt;br/&gt;related fields to assess the viability and promise of the proposals&lt;br/&gt;and to identify three candidate projects for the summer workshop.&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this process of soliciting proposals and recruiting&lt;br/&gt;the personnel to carry them out, we will make a diligent attempt&lt;br/&gt;to include researchers from underrepresented institutions and&lt;br/&gt;communities.</AbstractNarration>
