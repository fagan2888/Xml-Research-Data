    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS-0104163&lt;br/&gt;PI: Richard M. Schoen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Schoen is proposing to study the existence of an extremal metric&lt;br/&gt;which defines the Bartnik quasilocal mass for a domain in a spacetime of&lt;br/&gt;general relativity. This would yield an existence theorem for&lt;br/&gt;asymptotically flat solutions of the static vacuum Einstein equations with&lt;br/&gt;suitable boundary conditions. It is part of a variational approach for&lt;br/&gt;constructing three dimensional geometries. Schoen's second project&lt;br/&gt;involves the construction of special lagrangian, and more generally&lt;br/&gt;minimal lagrangian, submanifolds in Calabi-Yau and Kaehler-Einstein&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The approach is to construct hamiltonian stationary&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds by direct volume minimization among lagrangian submanifolds,&lt;br/&gt;and to obtain sufficient regularity to show that they are minimal&lt;br/&gt;lagrangian. Schoen's third project is to further develop the harmonic map&lt;br/&gt;approach to prove the rigidity of smooth actions of lattices in semisimple&lt;br/&gt;Lie groups on compact manifolds. Professor Mutao Wang proposes to study&lt;br/&gt;the mean curvature flow for special classes of submanifolds of&lt;br/&gt;codimension greater than one. The major thrust is to obtain stability and&lt;br/&gt;regularity properties of the flow. Dr. Baozhang Yang will study singular&lt;br/&gt;behavior of Yang-Mills connections in arbitrary dimension. This study will&lt;br/&gt;include an investigation into the structure of blow-up sets and asymptotic&lt;br/&gt;behavior near singularities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project concerns the study of geometric shapes which&lt;br/&gt;optimize certain physical and geometric energies. For curved spacetimes in&lt;br/&gt;general relativity, there is no natural mass-energy density which can be&lt;br/&gt;assigned to the gravitational field, so Bartnik proposed to measure the&lt;br/&gt;gravitational mass of a region in a spacetime by minimizing the total mass&lt;br/&gt;of all physical spacetimes which contain this region as a subset. This&lt;br/&gt;minimal mass spacetime, if it can be shown to exist, will be a static&lt;br/&gt;solution of Einstein's equations. One of the goals of this project is to&lt;br/&gt;find a way to construct such static solutions, and to use them to study&lt;br/&gt;three dimensional geometry. It is expected that three dimensional spaces&lt;br/&gt;have natural geometries on them which are uniquely characterized by their&lt;br/&gt;curvature properties. Another goal of this project is to construct certain&lt;br/&gt;special surfaces in Calabi-Yau manifolds, the spaces of string&lt;br/&gt;theory. These (three dimensional) surfaces, called special lagrangian&lt;br/&gt;submanifolds, are analogous to soap films in that they are surfaces of &lt;br/&gt;least possible area. Finally, it is proposed to study the evolution&lt;br/&gt;problem for surfaces which is called the mean curvature evolution. This is&lt;br/&gt;an evolution problem which moves a surface in space in such a way that its&lt;br/&gt;area is decreased most rapidly. Understanding the behavior of this&lt;br/&gt;evolution is important for simplifying and smoothing complicated surfaces&lt;br/&gt;in an optimal way. Mathematically this is a difficult problem because the&lt;br/&gt;surfaces may develop singularities such as cone points and tears which&lt;br/&gt;must be accounted for.</AbstractNarration>
