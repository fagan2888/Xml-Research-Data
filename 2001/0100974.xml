    <AbstractNarration>This project requests travel support for 10 student participants from U.S.&lt;br/&gt;universities in the Student Paper Competition at the 2001 International Topical Meeting&lt;br/&gt;on Microwave Photonics (MWP).&lt;br/&gt;The International Topical Meeting on Microwave Photonics (MWP) is the major&lt;br/&gt;international meeting on microwave photonic devices, systems and applications. The&lt;br/&gt;MWP'01 is co-sponsored by the Microwave Theory and Techniques Society (MTT-S) and the Lasers and Electro-Optics Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics&lt;br/&gt;Engineers (IEEE). It will be held in Long Beach, CA on October 7-10, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;Each year, the IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society and IEEE Lasers&lt;br/&gt;and Electro-Optics Society promote student education in microwave and photonics&lt;br/&gt;engineering through a number of mechanisms. The Best Student Paper Program at the&lt;br/&gt;MWP is one of the student outreach programs to promote the interactions among&lt;br/&gt;students, faculty and industrial participants, and helps to develop the students' technical&lt;br/&gt;acumen as well as their communication skills. It also introduces them to the international&lt;br/&gt;technical community and helps to build a community of students who will lead the next&lt;br/&gt;generation of microwave photonics engineers.&lt;br/&gt;The MWP provides financial support of various forms to student presenters but&lt;br/&gt;does not reimburse travel expenses. Travel support from NSF will ensure that the&lt;br/&gt;program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S. universities.</AbstractNarration>
