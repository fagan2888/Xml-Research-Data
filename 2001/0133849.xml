    <AbstractNarration>This Career Development Plan involves an integrated collection of research and &lt;br/&gt;educational activities focused on algorithms for high-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;geometric problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric computing with high-dimensional data is of crucial importance to &lt;br/&gt;many areas of computer science, including machine learning, data mining, &lt;br/&gt;databases and information retrieval, computer vision and computational biology.&lt;br/&gt;Example problems in this area are: nearest neighbor search, many variants of &lt;br/&gt;data clustering, and discovering linear structure of the data (e.g. via &lt;br/&gt;Principal Component Analysis (PCA)). &lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, the classical geometric algorithms for many of these problems &lt;br/&gt;do not scale well with the dimension. For example, the running times of the &lt;br/&gt;classical algorithms for the nearest neighbor search depend exponentially &lt;br/&gt;on the dimension, which makes them inefficient for dimension higher than, &lt;br/&gt;say, 20. This is unfortunate, since many applications involve number of &lt;br/&gt;dimensions anywhere from a few hundred to a few million.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, new, powerful techniques for solving these&lt;br/&gt;problems have been discovered, most notably dimensionality reduction and &lt;br/&gt;random sampling in geometric spaces. The algorithms obtained using those &lt;br/&gt;techniques enjoy very low (at most linear) dependence on the dimension, &lt;br/&gt;at the cost of providing approximate answers. The problems amenable to &lt;br/&gt;these techniques include nearest neighbor search, clustering and PCA.&lt;br/&gt;However, the algorithmic solutions to these problems still possess &lt;br/&gt;(sometimes quite severe) limitations. Our goal is to identify methods for &lt;br/&gt;circumventing these limitations and making the algorithms efficient, both &lt;br/&gt;in theory and in practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The techniques which led to the development of the aforementioned &lt;br/&gt;algorithms are new and still not widely known. &lt;br/&gt;They include many tools which have been developed during 70s and 80s &lt;br/&gt;in the field of mathematics called functional analysis. &lt;br/&gt;However, computer scientists became aware of those methods only very recently,&lt;br/&gt;and many of the fundamental results are still not widely known or used.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore, it is important to make these results accessible to large computer &lt;br/&gt;science audience so that they can be successfully used, investigated and &lt;br/&gt;developed. In the Education Plan section we outline a plan on how to make &lt;br/&gt;them more accessible to students as well as computer scientists.</AbstractNarration>
