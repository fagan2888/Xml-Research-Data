    <AbstractNarration>NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0103954&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Collaborative Research: Capillary &lt;br/&gt;Interfaces&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0103954&lt;br/&gt;Finn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses behavior of solutions to the &lt;br/&gt;mathematical equations of capillarity theory. The &lt;br/&gt;equations will be studied in their full nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;generality, using procedures deriving from the intrinsic &lt;br/&gt;structure of the physical problems. These procedures &lt;br/&gt;have turned out to interact in a natural way with newly &lt;br/&gt;developed methods of geometric measure theory, which were &lt;br/&gt;developed initially for the special case of minimal &lt;br/&gt;surfaces in other contexts. In a number of cases of &lt;br/&gt;interest, striking and unusual behavior of solutions was &lt;br/&gt;uncovered in this way. Our investigations will continue &lt;br/&gt;in directions that have already led to discoveries of &lt;br/&gt;discontinuous dependence on boundary data, symmetry &lt;br/&gt;breaking, failure of existence under physical conditions, &lt;br/&gt;failure of uniqueness under conditions for which &lt;br/&gt;solutions exist, and discontinuous reversal of comparison &lt;br/&gt;relations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Capillary interfaces play an important role in many &lt;br/&gt;practical situations, notably in reduced gravity or in &lt;br/&gt;configurations for which physical length scales are very &lt;br/&gt;small. Capillarity is an essential concept for &lt;br/&gt;describing situations in which substances are in contact &lt;br/&gt;at surface interfaces and do not mix. A precise &lt;br/&gt;understanding of the mathematical properties of solutions &lt;br/&gt;of the capillarity equations will provide valuable &lt;br/&gt;insight for resolving such matters as how to design fuel &lt;br/&gt;tanks on an orbiting spacecraft so that the fuel will be &lt;br/&gt;accessibly located, predicting where oil or water resides &lt;br/&gt;in underground pore spaces of rocks, or determining the &lt;br/&gt;manner in which the faces of microelectronic components &lt;br/&gt;will become partially covered when they are dipped in a &lt;br/&gt;coating bath. The work under consideration is of &lt;br/&gt;particular relevance for predicting unexpected behavior &lt;br/&gt;of liquids in these and in other applications.</AbstractNarration>
