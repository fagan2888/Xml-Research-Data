    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop compact, all-solid-state, pulsed drivers coupled with solid-state protection circuitry for powering laser diodes/diode arrays and increasing their reliability and lifetime. New high-current semiconductor switch technology will be coupled with proprietary new diode protection circuits featuring fault-mode detection and high-speed current limiting to extend laser diode lifetime tenfold. This leads directly to a tenfold reduction in annual laser operating cost. Recent breakthroughs in high power semiconductor technology, namely the &lt;br/&gt;Gate Commutated Thyristor (GCT) switch, also offer significant improvement in speed, power, and compact size over existing commercial devices. Phase II will develop advanced, compact pulsed power modules based on these technologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GCT technology, coupled with a proprietary fast protection circuitry, offers a significant decrease in diode laser system size and weight and a tenfold decrease in laser cost-of-ownership made possible by increased diode lifetime. New commercial applications for the diode-pumped solid-state lasers are expected to include powering diodes for optical telecommunications and ultraviolet and X-ray point sources for Next Generation Lithography in the semiconductor industry, as well as in laser cutting and welding. Medical uses for this new fault-protected, solid-state driver technology will include oncology and gene therapy.</AbstractNarration>
