    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Exercise physiology is fundamental for researchers and majors in health fitness, athletic training,&lt;br/&gt;physical education, and health education. Not unlike other sciences, exercise physiology&lt;br/&gt;instruction that provides students with iihands-onl. laboratory experiences creates the most&lt;br/&gt;positive learning climate, leads to a more complete understanding of basic physiological&lt;br/&gt;processes, and increases comprehension of scientific principles, concepts and methods.&lt;br/&gt;Currently, due to lack of metabolic analyzing equipment, the instruction of many exercise&lt;br/&gt;physiology laboratory activities has been done via more traditional demonstration methods than&lt;br/&gt;full and active student participation in the exercises themselves. The acquisition of key&lt;br/&gt;instructional equipment (metabolic analyzer and treadmill) will expand and strengthen the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student's experience in exercise physiology and help foster a direct problem-&lt;br/&gt;solving approach to the learning process in scheduled laboratory sessions, independent research&lt;br/&gt;or other out-of-class projects. The objectives of this project are two-fold: a) to provide expired&lt;br/&gt;gas analyzing instrumentation to enable students to study several fundamental exercise&lt;br/&gt;physiology principles that cannot be investigated with the current equipment and b) to promote&lt;br/&gt;and encourage active learning and student research opportunities. The improved learning and&lt;br/&gt;research resulting from the integration of the requested equipment into the curriculum will&lt;br/&gt;advance the college's commitment to undergraduate research throughout the academic program.</AbstractNarration>
