    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21). This proof-of-concept project is creating a Web-based set of instructional materials consisting of a database of interactive mathematical curves, a "National Curve Bank," together with exercises related to the characteristics of these curves. Three mathematical areas are under development: Precalculus, Calculus, and the History of Mathematics; and within each of these areas, links to specific topics allow students to access and make use of a wide variety of curves. Accompanying exercises ask the student to manipulate the curves or investigate their attributes. A prototype for this project has been investigated, featuring animation and interactive components. Such a "National Curve Bank" expects to provide students with immediate feedback and permit faculty to add an active learning component to various courses.</AbstractNarration>
