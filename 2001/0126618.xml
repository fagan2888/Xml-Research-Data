    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project adapts successful models from CSU Hayward and James Madison University to facilitate the incorporation of DNA sequencing technology into both the undergraduate curriculum and independent student research at CSU Chico. We are creating a modern automated DNA sequencing facility and integrating sequencing into a wide variety of undergraduate courses (microbiology, plant and animal molecular biology, systematics and ecology) helping to unify our diverse disciplines. Undergraduate students are introduced to modern gene-based biology by incorporating hands-on sequencing and database exploration. The project has two objectives: (1) to improve undergraduate laboratory course experiences, and (2) to stimulate independent student research. We are quantifying class outcomes as students' individual and class projects, and independent research by student presentations and publications. We are also evaluating how well this project helps students prepare for further education or biology-related careers.</AbstractNarration>
