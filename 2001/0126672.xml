    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;An introductory course in "Supply Chain Management and Lean Design" is being developed. Lean design is a systematic approach to identifying and eliminating waste - through continuous improvement by flowing the product at the pull of the customer. Lean ideas have transformed process design. The challenge now is to make use of Internet-enabled information to link processes across global organizations. Lean design is guided by general principles, which are translated into practice using tactics such as creating manufacturing cells. The primary objective is to develop students' ability to apply lean design principles in global, multi-stage processes. The design process is complicated because in reality not all waste can be eliminated. To be effective designers, students need to understand how variability affects process dynamics and to combine this knowledge with analysis of process data. To accomplish our objective, we are developing this introductory course, which uses hands-on activities to assist students in discovering theory. It is followed by experiments in later courses that expand on and reinforce this theory. A variety of existing manufacturing and supply chain simulations are being adapted, as well as physical experiments in quality and variability, to the lean design framework. One contribution of this implementation is the integration of these activities into a more holistic experience, starting early in an undergraduate career. The plans are being guided by significant industry interaction and support faculty development in active-learning pedagogical methods.</AbstractNarration>
