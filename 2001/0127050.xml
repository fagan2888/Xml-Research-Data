    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13) The main project goal is to deliver more effective introductory science instruction to University of Central Florida's growing, diverse student population. It is well known that the majority of introductory physics students learn significantly more from carefully constructed activities than from traditional lectures. The Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment University Programs (SCALE-UP) project developed at North Carolina State University offers UCF a way to teach large studio classes where the emphasis is on learning by inquiry instead of learning by listening. The SCALE-UP approach is a complete revision of the standard lecture/laboratory. The students work in groups of 3-4 with computers and lab equipment for 4-6 hours each week in a large technology-rich laboratory designed to promote collaborative learning. Evaluations of NC State classes show that this approach is well matched to UCF's objectives of improving students' conceptual understanding, problem solving ability, and overall experience with introductory science classes. This project is developing curriculum materials and purchasing equipment for SCALE-UP physics and chemistry courses in an 80-student studio classroom. In addition to adopting activities developed at NC State, the UCF physics and chemistry education research groups are also developing new activities and instructor materials, particularly in chemistry where work is just starting. Curriculum development and evaluation are conducted in close collaboration with the SCALE-UP developers. This project should demonstrate that other schools can successfully adopt the SCALU-UP approach, which may lead to widespread changes in undergraduate math and science classes across the country.</AbstractNarration>
