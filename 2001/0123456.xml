    <AbstractNarration>0123456&lt;br/&gt;Raghavan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will support Dr. Madhavan Raghavan of the University of Iowa to make a planning visit to work in collaboration with Dr. Erasmo S. da Silva from the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil. This planning visit will permit the researchers to perform pilot studies and plan a collaborative research proposal. The overall objectives of the proposed research are: (1) To study the biomechanical properties of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using specimens obtained during autopsies performed at Sao Paulo University School of Medicine and (2) To evaluate the practicalities of the long-term collaboration. The structure of the planning visit takes into account the intellectual and physical assets of both participating investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal is to comprehensively study the biomechanical properties of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Both of the participants in the study, and their associates, will learn much about the science and the technique practiced by their counterparts. If the follow up were successful, the results would be of significant benefit worldwide.</AbstractNarration>
