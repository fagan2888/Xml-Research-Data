    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Paul A. Garris at Illinois State University&lt;br/&gt;to develop a new instrument for wireless monitoring of neural activity in&lt;br/&gt;the brain of awake, unrestrained animals. The new instrument, called&lt;br/&gt;real-time animal telemetry (RAT), will combine two powerful technologies;&lt;br/&gt;microsensors for spatially and temporally resolved measurements, and digital&lt;br/&gt;telemetry for remote data transmission and system control with high speed&lt;br/&gt;and high fidelity. The primary advantage of RAT will be sub-second&lt;br/&gt;characterization of brain function with minimal perturbation of behavior. &lt;br/&gt;The proposed RAT instrument holds great promise for advancing the study &lt;br/&gt;of brain-behavior relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RAT will be a modular and multifunctional instrument, a design that advances&lt;br/&gt;development and affords flexibility to its application. Several types of&lt;br/&gt;measurement techniques will be incorporated into RAT: Voltammetry which &lt;br/&gt;monitors the chemistry of the brain and electrophysiology which&lt;br/&gt;measures brain bioelectrical activity. Combined, the techniques assess the&lt;br/&gt;release of a neurotransmitter and its postsynaptic effect to obtain a more&lt;br/&gt;integrative view of brain function. Although great strides have recently been made &lt;br/&gt;applying real-time voltammetry and electrophysiology to awake animals, &lt;br/&gt;the connection between sensor and recording equipment is made by a cable tether. Unfortunately, the hard connection affects behavior and hinders or even prevents &lt;br/&gt;investigation of important paradigms such as those involving social interactions &lt;br/&gt;and complex environments. To overcome this problem, the new instrument will &lt;br/&gt;use a wireless link. Moreover, because real-time voltammetric and electrophysiological measurements are very susceptible to transmission artifacts, RAT will use high fidelity digital telemetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultimately, RAT should be commercially viable instrumentation in the support of&lt;br/&gt;biological research. The incorporation of well-established techniques will&lt;br/&gt;make the proposed RAT instrument attractive to large number of users working&lt;br/&gt;in the neuroscience fields. With further development, there is enormous&lt;br/&gt;potential for RAT to support other existing real-time microsensors. RAT can&lt;br/&gt;also evolve to accommodate sensor technologies that emerge in the future.</AbstractNarration>
