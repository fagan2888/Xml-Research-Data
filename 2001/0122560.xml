    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;This project brings fosters computer science education research by providing educators the opportunity to conduct principled, large-scale teaching and learning research, to bring them together and build upon expertise in research theory, design, and methods, and to support practioners when they engage in high-quality computer science education research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project comprises a set of integrated activities leading to a practioner designed experiment kit consisting of the detailed design of a piece of research, from methodology to analysis, which is situated within a theoretical framework. Practioners develop their kit during a week-long workshop in the first year, implement it with support during the academic year and re-convene to discuss results and plan for dissemination in the following summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to the improvement of the computer science education research community by developing educators skills and by exposing them to the relevant theory and methods of educational research.</AbstractNarration>
