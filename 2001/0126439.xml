    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13) The Open-Source Physics Education, OPEN, project is a synergy of curriculum development, computational physics, and physics education research based on the Principal Investigator's current WebPhysics project. Material from the OPEN project is being incorporated into three new texts: Gould, Tobochnik, and Christian's Computer Simulation Methods, the Principal Investigator's Open-Source Physics, and a topical Physlets workbook that can be used with a variety of standard texts. The OPEN project makes a large number of Java simulations available for physics education using the GNU Open-Source model for the source code. In addition, it entails the creation and maintenance of a website for the distribution of compiled applets and examples of interactive curricular material. The OPEN project plans two one-week summer workshops and full- and half-day workshops at national and regional professional meetings. A formal assessment of students' cognitive gains is being undertaken. The OPEN project impacts science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education nationwide through the distribution of a wide variety of class-tested interactive computer-based materials using both commercial and non-commercial distribution. The OPEN project is studying the conditions under which these materials can increase student learning. This assessment is of interest to all researchers studying the effectiveness of animation and simulation in teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>
