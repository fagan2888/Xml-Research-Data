    <AbstractNarration>We investigate four major unsolved problems in or bordering on harmonic&lt;br/&gt;analysis. These are the Kakeya problem, the Lipschitz differentiation&lt;br/&gt;problem, the restriction problem, and global solvability for the&lt;br/&gt;Navier Stokes equation. For the Kakeya problem, we continue our&lt;br/&gt;work with Tao on improving exponents in the sums-differences approach.&lt;br/&gt;For the problem of differentiation by Lipschitz vector fields, we try&lt;br/&gt;to apply our work on maximal functions in arbitrary directions to&lt;br/&gt;understand what are the limitations on a counterexample and hopefully&lt;br/&gt;that none can exist. For the restriction problem, we try to apply&lt;br/&gt;the new results on Kakeya and to better understand Bourgain's&lt;br/&gt;machine for converting Kakeya results to ones about restriction.&lt;br/&gt;For Navier Stokes, we first discretize everything in the&lt;br/&gt;form of a kind of generalized wavelet coefficients. In work with&lt;br/&gt;Pavlovic, this has already produced a generalization of&lt;br/&gt;the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg theorem to the case of hyperdissipation.&lt;br/&gt;We hope from this point of view to discover a sort of local dispersion&lt;br/&gt;property for the cascading effect from the nonlinear term. Then we&lt;br/&gt;hope to tie in the Clay problem with a dyadic model in which this&lt;br/&gt;dispersion is a given. As might be imagined, we are unlikely to solve&lt;br/&gt;all these problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis concerns the proof of estimates on interesting systems by&lt;br/&gt;examing the contributions of all their parts. One such system is&lt;br/&gt;the Navier Stokes equation which governs the behaviour of incompressible&lt;br/&gt;viscous fluids. An important open problem is whether this equation&lt;br/&gt;starting with smooth initial data can develop singularities without&lt;br/&gt;a forcing term. This would akin to a cyclone beginning spontaneously&lt;br/&gt;in one's bathtub. It seems rather unlikely but the tools of analysis&lt;br/&gt;are not yet strong enough to rule it out. Our approach is to&lt;br/&gt;discretize the problem, that is to try to approximate the problem&lt;br/&gt;by one about a finite number of objects and investigate possible&lt;br/&gt;interactions of those objects by means of combinatorics. Most&lt;br/&gt;physically arising mathematics can be looked at this way because matter&lt;br/&gt;is not continuous but rather composed of particles. We will work&lt;br/&gt;on the above problem and some other important problems which may be&lt;br/&gt;approached with the same point of view.</AbstractNarration>
