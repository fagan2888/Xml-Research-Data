    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is adapting course and curriculum modification from several engineering schools at Lake Superior State University. It involves the development of a new integrated Energy Conversion Laboratory that will support instruction in electro-mechanical conversion systems, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and modern industrial control. The laboratory is supporting seven courses in the EE and ME programs. Undergraduate students and senior design teams are working to integrate and implement the new laboratory. Project evaluation involves an assessment model that includes measurable educational objectives and department level review of each course. The investigators plan to disseminate results of the evaluation process along with detailed descriptions of the new trainers/interfaces and the data acquisition equipment by postings on the University's web site and presentations at engineering education conferences.</AbstractNarration>
