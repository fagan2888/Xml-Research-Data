    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for GRAPH-THEORETIC APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS (NSF #0105548)&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ramamoorthi Ravi, Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing size of communication and information networks has motivated&lt;br/&gt;several new problems in the design of networks with low cost and high&lt;br/&gt;resilience; Many of these problems are known to be prohibitively expensive&lt;br/&gt;in terms of computing power to solve to full accuracy. Yet these problem&lt;br/&gt;abstractions capture models from a variety of application areas such as&lt;br/&gt;communication network routing, multicasting messages in large&lt;br/&gt;networks, VLSI layout, and transportation networks with economies of scale.&lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal aims to advance our fundamental knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;the structure of good solutions to such inherently intractable computational&lt;br/&gt;problems involving networks. The investigators will develop approximation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for these problems -- these are heuristic methods that trade off&lt;br/&gt;some accuracy in the solution in return for lowered computational resources,&lt;br/&gt;in a quantifiable way. The research will involve the application of and new&lt;br/&gt;discovery of results in the theory of graphs to guide the design of these&lt;br/&gt;heuristic solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the investigators will design polynomial-time approximation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms with improved performance ratios for many basic graph-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;problems including the problem of augmenting a tree to make it&lt;br/&gt;two-connected, buy-at-bulk network design problems and the minimum $k$-cut&lt;br/&gt;problem. The investigators will continue their ongoing study of bicriteria&lt;br/&gt;network design problems (problems that involve two objective functions to be&lt;br/&gt;optimized simultaneously) to design improved bicriteria approximation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for many spanning tree problems arising in practice; These&lt;br/&gt;problems involve a combination of commonly studied objectives such as the&lt;br/&gt;maximum node degree, diameter and total cost of the tree. The research&lt;br/&gt;effort will focus on the theme of studying natural mathematical programming&lt;br/&gt;formulations for these NP-hard problems and attempt to derive improved&lt;br/&gt;approximation guarantees via rounding algorithms that will also establish&lt;br/&gt;the integrality gap of these basic formulations.</AbstractNarration>
