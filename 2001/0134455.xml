    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;The nonlinear vibrations and aeroelastic stability of two-dimensional gyroscopic systems such as high-speed rotating disks and translating webs are investigated using computational, analytical, and experimental techniques together with state-of-the-art models of nonlinear flexible rotating disks and thin translating webs interacting with three-dimensional shear flows. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research aims to identify regions in parameter space where aeroelastic flutter occurs, and investigate the complex post-flutter nonlinear modal interactions of this category of two-dimensional gyroscopic systems. The results will lead directly to a fundamental understanding of the factors (i) limiting rotation or transport speeds and (ii) causing flutter instabilities and will be critical for the future design of information storage and synthetic material processing technologies such as magnetic hard disk drives, optical drives, data storage tapes, printing, and paper, textile, plastics, and metal foil processing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The education plan focuses on the PI's current activities in five key areas for integrating research, education, and industrial outreach, including, amongst others (i) leveraging the PI's research in collaboration with Purdue's Minority in Engineering and Women in Engineering Programs for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups and women in engineering, and (ii) enhancing the undergraduate curriculum through the creation of a novel, hands-on "Mechanics Laboratory".</AbstractNarration>
