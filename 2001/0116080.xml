    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal # 0116080&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A grant has been awarded to Dr. Petrino at Barry University to acquire a Digital Image Documentation Station and a High-Speed Refrigerated Centrifuge for the Core Molecular Biology Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt; The scientific objective of this proposal is to comprehend the basic molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte differentiation and embryonic development using two well-established neuroendocrine model systems: the killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) and the zebrafish (Danio rerio). The project using the killifish focuses on understanding the relationship between the pituitary gland and the ovary in controlling cyclic reproduction. The long-term goal of the zebrafish project is to evaluate the role of genes involved in embryonic development. &lt;br/&gt; The first part of the project will involve gene cloning techniques for which the High-Speed Refrigerated Centrifuge is crucial. Once the genes of interest are cloned, they will be used in a variety of molecular procedures in order to determine the spatial and temporal expression of these genes during egg and early embryo development, for which the Digital Image Documentation System will be used to analyze the results. Results from this study may provide new insights for understanding not only the basic reproductive process but are also expected to further clarify the regulation of gene expression in early embryonic development. Furthermore, since the loss of some of these genes has been linked to various cancers, the results are expected to lead to further studies that may help in understanding mechanisms involved in the development of cancer. &lt;br/&gt; In addition to the proposed research, the instruments requested will be used for summer research training activities through workshops providing "hands-on" experience to minority undergraduates, high school science students and high school science teachers from Miami Dade and Broward counties. Some of the techniques learned by high school teachers are then incorporated into the curriculum thus exposing more high school students to modern biotechnology techniques. These equipments will also be available to new faculty members, including underrepresented female faculty, who are currently establishing their own research. Therefore, these two pieces of equipment will very much enhance the ability of this minority institution to provide an up to date research/learning environment for both, faculty and its diverse student body.</AbstractNarration>
