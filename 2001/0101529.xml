    <AbstractNarration>Viscous conservation laws arise in a wide variety of physical &lt;br/&gt;applications, including fluid dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics,&lt;br/&gt;and materials science. Of particular importance are solutions&lt;br/&gt;of such equations that are stable and hence typically &lt;br/&gt;correspond with observable phenomena. Unfortunately, establishing&lt;br/&gt;the stability of these solutions has proven to be a quite&lt;br/&gt;difficult problem. The pointwise Green's function approach,&lt;br/&gt;however, initiated by Liu and developed by Liu and his &lt;br/&gt;collaborators, has proven quite robust: in applications to &lt;br/&gt;viscous shock waves arising in single conservation laws of&lt;br/&gt;arbitrary order, viscous shock waves arising in systems &lt;br/&gt;with second order diffusion, planar viscous shock waves, &lt;br/&gt;degenerate viscous shock waves, and rarefaction waves. &lt;br/&gt;We propose to continue and extend this promising line of&lt;br/&gt;research in three directions. First, new techniques &lt;br/&gt;recently developed by Howard and Zumbrun appear suitable&lt;br/&gt;for extension to (i) systems of viscous conservation &lt;br/&gt;laws admitting degenerate viscous shock waves, and (ii)&lt;br/&gt;systems of viscous conservation laws with high order&lt;br/&gt;viscosity. Second, we propose to develop further &lt;br/&gt;techniques that will extend the pointwise Green's &lt;br/&gt;function approach to the case of viscous rarefaction &lt;br/&gt;waves. Finally, we would like to incorporate new techniques&lt;br/&gt;recently developed in the context of perturbation theory&lt;br/&gt;for completely integrable systems into the study of &lt;br/&gt;the necessarily oscillatory dynamics that arise in &lt;br/&gt;viscous conservation laws of order higher than two.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conservation of such fundamental properties as energy and&lt;br/&gt;momentum often leads to partial differential equations&lt;br/&gt;that model some underlying physical process. For example,&lt;br/&gt;the Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics and &lt;br/&gt;the Maxwell equations of electromagnetism follow this &lt;br/&gt;paradigm. Of primary concern are stable phenomena: those&lt;br/&gt;whose principal structure is robust to minor environmental&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations. We propose to continue and extend a &lt;br/&gt;promising line of research that has been extraordinarily &lt;br/&gt;successful in establishing a clear criterion for such&lt;br/&gt;stability. A direct consequence of the approach is a &lt;br/&gt;detailed understanding of certain fundamental partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations.</AbstractNarration>
