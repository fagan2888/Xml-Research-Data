    <AbstractNarration>0125703&lt;br/&gt;Wagner &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Case Western Reserve University (Lead Institution) to support the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners in the proposed effort include: Case Western Reserve University (Lead Institution), Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Inc., KAL Equity Capital Fund, Metro Health Medical Center, Nortech-Northeast Ohio Technology Coalition, Ohio Innovation Fund, Seven Roien Funds, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Edison Biotechnology, Inc., CID Equity Partners, Enterprise Development Inc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Activities&lt;br/&gt;The award has the following activities: (1) internships for local high school students to work at Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Bio Technology Park, (2) academic degree programs for undergraduate students to take one semester of bioengineering and management and internships for post graduates as part of the master's degree, (3) research activities in bioengineering or biomedical design where students design a product plus a business plan for its commercialization, (4) technology transfer with the use of a new incubator activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Innovation&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the effort is to change the culture in Northeast Ohio to promote vibrant entrepreneurship by attracting young people to biotechnology, creating new biomedical undergraduate and graduate entrepreneur track degree programs that combine engineering and management studies, funding for biology-related entrepreneurs for early evaluation of product concepts and commercialization, and mentoring for entrepreneurs by successful business partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The award will allow the Northeast Ohio region to apply its considerable academic research and education strengths to entrepreneurial endeavors that will generate economic development. The goal is for the region to become one of the top ten regions for biomedical industry employment by the year 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Societal Impact&lt;br/&gt;Young people will be recruited for careers in biotechnology and be given education in both engineering and management to prepare them to become entrepreneurs to lead the new biotechnology economy that will be one of the top ten in the nation by 2010. The emphasis on recruit and education of under-represented minorities is a major societal benefit.</AbstractNarration>
