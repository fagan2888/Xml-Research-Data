    <AbstractNarration>As a grass genome model, the Sorghum genome (~760 Mb) is the most logical complement to that of rice (~420 Mb), a distant relative that will be the first grass genome to be completely sequenced. Sorghum is an important bridge to closely-related large-genome crops in its own tribe (Andropogoneae) such as maize (~2500 Mb) and sugarcane (~2500-4200 Mb). Analysis of the levels and patterns of genomic diversity within and between sorghum, sugarcane, rice, and maize (and others) promises to advance understanding of the biology and evolution of Poaceae grain and biomass crops, and create new opportunities for their improvement. Data and tools from rice will aid in completion of a robust sorghum physical map and also serve as an important point of comparison to identify, and gain insights into, the basis of genomic diversity. Comparative tools will foster the extension of these results to neglected crops such as Bermuda grass and millet, and to noxious weeds such as 'Johnson grass.' Deliverables include a sorghum physical map that will support individual gene isolation and/or complete sequencing in sorghum and other genomes aligned to sorghum by comparative data. The physical map will also integrate genetic, comparative, cyto-molecular and diversity data into a rich Web-accessible resource to identify and study the 'footprints' of selection associated with plant evolution and crop improvement. A sorghum-sugarcane EST comparison is of far-reaching importance, shedding light on genes that differentiate grain and biomass crops that sustain humanity. Research is closely-tied to strong training and outreach programs with a successful history of engaging groups under-represented in the sciences, as well as K-12 students and undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
