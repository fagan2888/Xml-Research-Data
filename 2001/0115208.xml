    <AbstractNarration>SES 0115208&lt;br/&gt;Amy Slaton, Drexel University&lt;br/&gt;Minority Engineering Education in the United States, 1945 to the Present&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite ongoing governmental and institutional attempts at diversification, African&lt;br/&gt;Americans and other minorities remain severely underrepresented among university&lt;br/&gt;graduates in engineering fields. Many quantitative studies have measured this inequity&lt;br/&gt;and the impacts of individual educational reforms, but few scholars have explored&lt;br/&gt;historical or epistemological patterns behind the successes and failures of diversification&lt;br/&gt;efforts. Using archives, artifacts, and approximately 35 interviews with engineering&lt;br/&gt;instructors and graduates, this project compares engineering education in American&lt;br/&gt;universities attended primarily by black students and white students since 1945 to&lt;br/&gt;establish such an overview.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on four pairs of schools, representing each of four states and four historical&lt;br/&gt;eras, this study describes the broad political conditions in which these universities&lt;br/&gt;functioned, and provides detailed accounts of practices within their engineering&lt;br/&gt;classrooms and laboratories. The cases of Lincoln University (Missouri) and the&lt;br/&gt;University of Missouri will illustrate conditions during the science and engineering&lt;br/&gt;"manpower" crisis immediately following World War II. Technical programs at&lt;br/&gt;Maryland State College and the University of Maryland will illustrate the impacts of&lt;br/&gt;integration as separate-but-equal doctrines fell away in the 1950s. The histories of two&lt;br/&gt;urban schools, the Kennedy-King College and Illinois Institute of Technology in&lt;br/&gt;Chicago, will reflect the coalescence of civil rights activism and legislation in the 1960s&lt;br/&gt;and 1970s; and comparisons of Prairie View and Texas A&amp;M Universities will document&lt;br/&gt;the ascendance of political conservatism and a "post-industrial" economy in the 1980s&lt;br/&gt;and 1990s. Engineering curricula and course materials varied greatly among these&lt;br/&gt;settings, and this project treats post-secondary technical education since 1945 as both a&lt;br/&gt;reflection of prevailing social ideologies about race and a shaping force of those values.&lt;br/&gt;It explores, overall, the uncertain connection between technical and social modernity in&lt;br/&gt;contemporary America.</AbstractNarration>
