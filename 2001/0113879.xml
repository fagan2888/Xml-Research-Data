    <AbstractNarration>This award to New York University is for the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope for DNA nanotechnology research and education. The features of the AFM include tapping mode, lithography mode and automatic high-resolution scanning. DNA technology is an area of materials science developed at NYU over the past two decades. It is based on the combination of stable branched DNA motifs and their specific associations as directed biotechnological technique, DNA sticky-ended cohesion. Early projects in this area involved the assembly of geometrical objects, such as a DNA cube and a DNA truncated octahedron that could be characterized by gel electrophoresis. The species made at NYU are novel materials that are expected to have applications in nanoelectronics, nanorobotics, information storage, and structural biophysics. Experiments are underway to organize nanoelectronic components in 2D arrays by attaching them to DNA arrays. The incorporation of the sequence-activated device into an array will lead to the large numbers of structurally distinct states that characterize nanorobotics. Mechanical and chemical modification of arrays can lead to information storage systems. This instrumentation will accelerate significantly the development of this field. The award will contribute to the training and education of graduate students and postdocs in this new area of materials research.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award to New York University is for the acquisition of an Atomic Force Microscope for DNA nanotechnology research and education.
