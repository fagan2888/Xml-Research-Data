    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates DNA microarray technology and the application of bioinformatic data analysis as a core technology in the undergraduate Biology, Biochemistry and Bioinformatics curricula at USP. Microarray technology is an important biotechnology tool for the study of gene expression and in molecular diagnostics and has launched a paradigm shift in the way pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries approach drug discovery and development. An entire industry of microarray instrument, reagent and bioinformatic companies have developed to meet the current and future needs of the biological science community. Recently, instrumentation has been developed for making microarrays ("gridders") and microarray readers ("scanners") that are marketed and priced for the small laboratory environment. Students who graduate with a Life Science degree in the 21st century need to know the scientific principles and practical technological skills of microarray technology. Our cross-disciplinary curriculum program adapts microarray technology and develops microarray specific exercises in three courses, Molecular Biology (BI-290), Genetics (BS-466), Bioinformatics (BI-450) and supports undergraduate research in our Directed Research program (BS-499 and CH-450). This program is part of the educational foundation for our new Bachelor of Science degree in Bioinformatics and gives students in the Biology and Biochemistry programs the opportunity to experience microarray technology in their 2nd , 3rd or 4th years of study. Students carry out gene expression and DNA diagnostic experiments, and work with the bioinformatic software that is used to organize and mine microarray data. Successful implementation of this proposal is leading to the expansion of DNA microarray exercises to other courses and programs (eg. Microbiology). This project is providing a curricular template that leads to protocols and data sets for other undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
