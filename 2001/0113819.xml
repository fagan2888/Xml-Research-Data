    <AbstractNarration>This project relieves the shortage of qualified information assurance personnel by providing generous financial support for at least 23 masters level students in the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Information Assurance Educational program. Several interdisciplinary degrees are offered in the program that allow students to specialize in their particular interest area within the field. There are a growing number of Information Assurance and Computer Security faculty and researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, and the students have outstanding opportunities to work in world-class on-campus entities such as the Software Engineering Institute and the CERT Coordination Center. Through classroom instruction, project work, and supplemental curricular activities such as an Information Technology lecture series, the student participants become leaders in the information security area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The university is also focused on the development and success of other programs in this area. To that end, Carnegie Mellon University plans to host an annual intensive seminar for current and/or prospective CAE/IAE institution faculty. The seminars will consist of a three-day instructional dialog offering approximately 30 faculty members access to existing CAE/IAE program curricula and methodologies.</AbstractNarration>
