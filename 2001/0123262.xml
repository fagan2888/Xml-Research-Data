    <AbstractNarration>McBay &lt;br/&gt;OIA-0123262&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network, a non-profit organization, has been instrumental in improving the education of under-represented groups that have been historically undeserved by the nation's educational system. A successor to the Quality Education for Minorities Project based at MIT, QEM continues to develop effective strategies of SMET education for minorities, and focuses on issues and barriers that prevent minorities for receiving a high quality education. In order for minority serving institutions to offer competitive research and research training programs in the sciences, faculty and students must have access to state-of-the-art instrumentation to enable them to conduct high quality research. This award to QEM will make it possible to provide technical assistance to minority -serving institutions; equipping faculty with the essential tools needed develop competitive instrumentation proposals to NSF's equipment programs, including the Major Research Instrumentation Program. As a result all US institutions will have opportunity to secure funds needed to facilitate their efforts in the quest to unravel the challenges presented by the universe.</AbstractNarration>
