    <AbstractNarration>Oglala Lakota College (OLC) is a tribally controlled and community governed four-year&lt;br/&gt;academic institution with 1300 students located in ten college centers across the&lt;br/&gt;Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota (SD). The student base is approximately 90%&lt;br/&gt;American Indian. As one of six NSF-designated Model Institutions for Excellence &lt;br/&gt;(MIE), OLC has developed the infrastructure to offer Science, Engineering, Math and&lt;br/&gt;Technology (SMET) degrees and increase the number of Native Americans continuing &lt;br/&gt;on to graduate school. We currently have general collaboration agreements with the &lt;br/&gt;SD School of Mines &amp; Technology (SDSM&amp;T) and SD State University. Since 1995, the &lt;br/&gt;MIE Program at OLC has developed five new accredited degrees in the SMET areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presently the Oglala Lakota Nation is forced to outsource all analytical work to off-&lt;br/&gt;reservation labs due to the lack of qualified facilities and expertise. Our long-term &lt;br/&gt;goal is to train a pool of highly skilled scientists and lab technicians who will serve&lt;br/&gt;their communities as self-employed entrepreneurs or hired employees. Also, one of &lt;br/&gt;the major shortcomings of our SMET programs is the lack of lab facilities with modern &lt;br/&gt;analytical equipment. This creates a disadvantage for our students at every level of &lt;br/&gt;their career.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose a multifaceted approach to develop the technological infrastructure of our&lt;br/&gt;institution and the reservation as a whole. We will build a research center housing &lt;br/&gt;several federal and state certified labs that will provide us with the capacity to conduct&lt;br/&gt;research and routine analytical work in the areas of chemistry, environmental science, and &lt;br/&gt;biology. Collaboration agreements with three faculty members at SDSM&amp;T and Black Hills&lt;br/&gt;State University in these areas are procured for this proposal. We will actively seek &lt;br/&gt;partnerships with tribal agencies to provide research and analytic services. This insures&lt;br/&gt;that a significant portion of the funding allocated by tribal agencies would be re-infused&lt;br/&gt;into the reservation economy. This would also sustain the project beyond NSF funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our faculty and students will be trained on the equipment by the collaborators and&lt;br/&gt;through industrial short courses, workshops and seminars. Both collaborators and &lt;br/&gt;faculty will initiate research projects involving our students utilizing the new equipment. &lt;br/&gt;We will strengthen our curriculum by developing new analytical lab classes and by&lt;br/&gt;enhancing existing sciencecourses. Finally, students and faculty will reach out to &lt;br/&gt;reservation communities to help them address their concerns about economic &lt;br/&gt;development and the environment. Students and faculty will also teach SMET&lt;br/&gt;classes at reservation schools and will open up the labs for teachers and students &lt;br/&gt;to stimulate scientific knowledge and curiosity .</AbstractNarration>
