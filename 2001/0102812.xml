    <AbstractNarration>Tougaloo College seeks to increase the number of majors in science, math, and &lt;br/&gt;computer science who ar successful in their courses, who complete undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;studies with honors, and who attend graduate school in the sciences and technology.&lt;br/&gt; The college has an excellent track record for placing students in medical and health&lt;br/&gt; professional schools, and has also recently been cited as among the top five &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate sources of African-American doctorates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program has three strategies. The first is to improve student success in&lt;br/&gt;introductory courses in biology, chemistry and mathematics. To our tutorial drop-in&lt;br/&gt;center we are adding three people (two supported by this grant) to provide weekly&lt;br/&gt;supplemental instruction sessions for the first two years of of instruction in &lt;br/&gt;these disciplines. In addition test practice sessions will be held to familiarize &lt;br/&gt;students with standardized test questions from examinations such as the &lt;br/&gt;Graduate Record Examination and the Medical College Admissions Test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will also build the enrollment in our physics, pre-engineering, and computer &lt;br/&gt;science programs. We will sponsor a six-week summer program to introduce &lt;br/&gt;students to both fields, along with reading and English skills. We will offer a &lt;br/&gt;number of scholarships to talented students in computer science or physics &lt;br/&gt;who maintain a 3.3 science GPA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally we plan to stimulate interest in science and in graduate school by &lt;br/&gt;supporting research as an integral part of of the life of both faculty and student &lt;br/&gt;scientists. Contrary to its past tradition, the college will provide time for older &lt;br/&gt;faculty and new faculty to set up a viable on-campus research program, through &lt;br/&gt;either released time or sabbatical leaves. This program will continue to be &lt;br/&gt;supported by the College after the grant, as faculty acquire outside funding.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These initiatives will provide a rich, stimulating environment for students which&lt;br/&gt; will provide a unique window on the reasons why people become scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1</AbstractNarration>
