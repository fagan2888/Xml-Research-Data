    <AbstractNarration>This project is adapting and implementing the processes developed by the NSF funded ATE Center - Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC). MATEC has developed competency based multimedia modules to educate instructors of semiconductor manufacturing technology programs in specific processes and equipment of the semiconductor industry. Embedded in the MATEC model is a learner focus. This project uses the MATEC model to develop Web based experiential laboratory exercises for students in an Associate of Applied Science in Controls Technology and Manufacturing Technology programs. These simulations or experiential modules replace the traditional laboratory exercises of a site based Manufacturing, Instrumentation or Controls Technology curriculum, and instead do them in a Web environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory components of the curriculum are already commercially available in a digital format and have been satisfactorily tested for past the 5 years at San Juan College. The missing and critical component for effective delivery of the curriculum via distant education is the experiential or hands on laboratory exercise in a format suitable for effective learning in a Web environment. The rapid growth of web-based education and the rapid rate of technology changes in industry and society have created a need for a revised methodology in educational curriculum and delivery. This refocus must facilitate lifelong learning and have a learner driven process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is creating 16 virtual laboratory or experiential modules for two different classes over the two-year life of the project. It is developing a distance education competency based experiential model that can be used to implement the curricular objectives of the traditional 'hands on' or laboratory exercises in the virtual world of a web based program.</AbstractNarration>
