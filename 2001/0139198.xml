    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for an REU Site in anthropology in West Central Highland Guatemala. The topic for the Site is culture change and continuity in Guatemala. Twelve undergraduate students will participate in the 12-week summer program. The students will be recruited from Brigham Young University, University of Illinois-Chicago, University of Texas-Pan American, and Southwest Texas State University. The goal of the Site is to prepare a diversified pool of talented undergraduates, especially those from underrepresented groups, for full participation in the professional community of social science by experiencing all the stages of research, including problem conceptualization, independent field research, analysis, write up, oral presentation at academic fora, and scholarly publication. While in the field, students will conduct ethnographic field research and also attend a weekly methods and ethics seminar. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
