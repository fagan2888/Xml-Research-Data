    <AbstractNarration>0138475&lt;br/&gt;Gosnold&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is for support of a cooperative project by Professor William Gosnold, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, North Dakota and Dr. Abdallah Al-Zoubi of the Geophysics Department of the Natural Resources Authority, Amman, Jordan. They plan to conduct exploratory research in Jordan by making geothermal measurements in existing boreholes, made for purposes such as mining and oil drilling. These data would then be used to determine the terrestrial heat flux from the crust, and to reconstruct the ground surface temperature history for the past 500-1000 years. Subsurface temperature bears importance to our understanding of the climate history at the Earth's surface and the tectono-thermal structure and evolution of the lithosphere. Understanding the terrestrial heat flux at various places in Jordan has the potential to shed light on the tectonic development of the Dead Sea Rift, as a part of the larger Red Sea rift system. The paleoclimate of the area over the past millennium may help explain the spatial transition from Mediterranean climate to desert climate in this region. The scientists will assess data quality to determine the feasibility of making extensive data collection through a full-scale collaborative research project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: In this project the collaborators plan to combine their expertise to explore the soundness of using existing boreholes to make paleoclimatology and heat flow measurements. The two scientists have complementary expertise. The US PI is experienced in borehole measurements and in paleoclimatology. The Jordanian scientist has experience with the field research area and has produced strong publications on that area. The US PI will include a graduate student from U. North Dakota in the field research thus giving him experience in an international research setting. The project meets INT criteria for support of cooperative projects that are mutually beneficial.</AbstractNarration>
