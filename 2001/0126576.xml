    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;The College is involved in an effort to transform regular classrooms into "Learning College" classrooms across the institution. As part of this institutional effort, the Chemistry Department is transforming course material to contextual formats. In this project, the faculty in chemistry are working together with Forensic Scientists from a regional crime laboratory to incorporate GC/MS experiments across the two-year college chemistry curriculum, including Organic Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry, College Chemistry, and General Chemistry courses. The objectives of the proposal are to: 1. adapt, adopt, and pilot test laboratory experiments in organic, forensic, general, and college chemistry courses; 2. provide faculty development on the use, calibration, and maintenance of the GC/MS; and 3. expand outreach to high school chemistry teachers and students through a Sinclair program called the Friday Visitation Program. The project is meeting the needs of high school and two-year college students for GC/MS experience as they matriculate to universities and enter the workforce as technicians. The results of the project will be disseminated through presentations at professional conferences and articles in journals.</AbstractNarration>
