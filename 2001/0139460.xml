    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to Duke University for a five-year REU Site Program for Increasing Diversity at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering, under the direction of Ms. Martha Absher. This nine-week summer program will provide in-depth research opportunities for 8 women, underrepresented minorities, and disabled undergraduate students in projects covering a wide range of topics including diagnostics and biomaterials, medical imaging, cochlear implants and drug transport in solid tumors. The REU Fellows will work closely with a Pratt researcher and/or graduate studentmentor on individual research projects especially designed for them in laboratories on the Duke campus.</AbstractNarration>
