    <AbstractNarration>Computer architecture research is based on experimental evaluation of application behavior.&lt;br/&gt;One critical issue in the architecture of high-end enterprise servers is the design of the memory&lt;br/&gt;hierarchy, which must be designed to support current and future data-intensive applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Few evaluations of the memory behavior of large commercial applications exist, especially in the&lt;br/&gt;public domain. The research proposed here is based on a collaboration between IBM and USC to&lt;br/&gt;take advantage of the IBM Watson Server Performance Laboratory to explore the memory&lt;br/&gt;behavior of high-end commercial applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, it is proposed to use the IBM MemorIES board to collect bus activity&lt;br/&gt;traces from a modern server machine running large, finely tuned OLTP, DSS and Web workloads.&lt;br/&gt;Because of the sheer size of the traces, samples of transaction records will be collected only &lt;br/&gt;in selected time intervals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides obtaining traces, the goal of this project is to characterize the memory&lt;br/&gt;behavior of these applications, to evaluate alternative memory hierarchies for future&lt;br/&gt;high-end commercial servers, and to explore new multiprocessor architectures for&lt;br/&gt;commercial systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The experimental environment provided by the IBM Watson Server Performance Laboratory&lt;br/&gt;cost millions of dollars and years of effort to setup. This proposed research will leverage these&lt;br/&gt;efforts. It is a unique opportunity to collect and disseminate traces and experimental data&lt;br/&gt;which would be practically impossible to obtain under any reasonable research budget.</AbstractNarration>
