    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0104026&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Michael W. Davis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a proposal for research in geometric group theory&lt;br/&gt;focusing on Coxeter groups, Artin groups, and mapping class&lt;br/&gt;groups of surfaces. The main problems to be addressed are the&lt;br/&gt;following.&lt;br/&gt;(1) For which Coxeter groups is the Coxeter diagram uniquely&lt;br/&gt;determined by the group? For which Coxeter groups is the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental generating set uniquely determined (up to&lt;br/&gt;conjugation) by the group? For which Coxeter groups is the outer&lt;br/&gt;automorphism group finite?&lt;br/&gt;(2) Are all Artin groups linear groups? &lt;br/&gt;(3) Find a formula for the cohomology with compact supports of a&lt;br/&gt;building. Likewise for the Salvetti complex of an Artin group.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Determine the l^2 Betti numbers of cubical manifolds&lt;br/&gt;associated to right-angled Coxeter groups. Do they vanish outside&lt;br/&gt;the middle dimension? This would imply the Flag Complex&lt;br/&gt;Conjecture concerning triangulations of odd-dimensional spheres&lt;br/&gt;and has implications for graph embeddings.&lt;br/&gt;(5) Develop a theory of mock reflection groups. This is a class of&lt;br/&gt;groups similar to Coxeter groups which arise as transformations&lt;br/&gt;of blow-ups of hyperplane arrangements.&lt;br/&gt;(6) Is the Torelli subgroup of the mapping class groups of a&lt;br/&gt;surface of genus at least three finitely generated?&lt;br/&gt;(7) Can a word hyperbolic group be the fundamental group of a&lt;br/&gt;surface by surface bundle? Must all finitely presented non word&lt;br/&gt;hyperbolic groups contain a Baumslag-Solitar group or an abelian&lt;br/&gt;group of rank two?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Group theory arises from the study of symmetries of an&lt;br/&gt;object. When this object has an interesting geometric structure,&lt;br/&gt;one can use geometric techniques to better understand the group&lt;br/&gt;of symmetries. This project involves the study of certain&lt;br/&gt;families of groups which arise in a broad range of mathematical&lt;br/&gt;and physical contexts, such as the study of crystal structures&lt;br/&gt;and the intertwining of DNA. These groups are associated to rich&lt;br/&gt;and beautiful geometric structures which lend themselves to the&lt;br/&gt;techniques of geometric group theory.</AbstractNarration>
