    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bernard Shiffman will continue his research on the statistics of random&lt;br/&gt;polynomials in several complex variables and more generally of random&lt;br/&gt;sections of powers of positive line bundles on compact complex manifolds and&lt;br/&gt;on almost complex symplectic manifolds. He will investigate the "scaling&lt;br/&gt;limit" statistics as the degree of the polynomial or the power of the line&lt;br/&gt;bundle goes to infinity when distances are rescaled so that densities are&lt;br/&gt;normalized. He will study spacing of zeros, hole probabilities, pair&lt;br/&gt;correlations for local maxima, and other topics. He will also study&lt;br/&gt;correlations of critical points of spherical harmonics. In another&lt;br/&gt;direction, he will study the compact singularities of equidimensional&lt;br/&gt;meromorphic mappings into compact complex manifolds. He will also look for&lt;br/&gt;new examples of Kobayashi hyperbolic hypersurfaces in complex projective&lt;br/&gt;3-space. Kobayashi hyperbolic spaces do not carry any entire holomorphic&lt;br/&gt;curves; simple examples are the Cartesian squares of curves of genus greater&lt;br/&gt;than 1 and symmetric squares of generic curves of genus greater than 2. He&lt;br/&gt;will look for low-degree hyperbolic birational images of these surfaces in&lt;br/&gt;complex projective 3-space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project is motivated by a need to understand complex quantum&lt;br/&gt;mechanical systems. Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory that&lt;br/&gt;describes the behavior of atoms and molecules and their component&lt;br/&gt;particles--protons, neutrons, and electrons. These particles are described&lt;br/&gt;by wave functions, which are solutions of Schrodinger's equation. The zeros&lt;br/&gt;and local maxima of wave functions give important information on states of&lt;br/&gt;atoms and molecules; the zeros are known in quantum chemistry and physics as&lt;br/&gt;nodal lines. The behavior of random polynomials provide an elementary model&lt;br/&gt;similar to complex quantum systems. Polynomials in several variables&lt;br/&gt;correspond to systems with several degrees of freedom, and those polynomials&lt;br/&gt;of high degree correspond to wave functions for highly excited states. The&lt;br/&gt;project includes statistics on symplectic manifolds, which serve as the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for the states of quantum systems. Another component of&lt;br/&gt;the research involves understanding the geometry of complex algebraic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, which play an important role in quantum field theory and provide&lt;br/&gt;models for diverse physical phenomena.</AbstractNarration>
