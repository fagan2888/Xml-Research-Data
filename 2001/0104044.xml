    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0104044&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposal the research will study the geometry, &lt;br/&gt;asymptotic behavior, conformal structure and topology &lt;br/&gt;of properly embedded minimal surfaces in R3 . &lt;br/&gt;One of the main goals of the proposal is to classify &lt;br/&gt;all properly embedded minimal surfaces of genus zero &lt;br/&gt;and to describe the asymptotic geometry of all finite genus examples. &lt;br/&gt;Related theoretical techniques concerning compactness, &lt;br/&gt;regularity and convergence of minimal surfaces of &lt;br/&gt;locally bounded genus will be investigated as well. &lt;br/&gt;One hoped for application of this research is &lt;br/&gt;to classify all smooth finite group actions on S3 . &lt;br/&gt;Finally the research proposes to prove that Bryant surfaces &lt;br/&gt;in hyperbolic three-space are unknotted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Classical minimal surface theory has its roots in 18th and 19th century mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and gives one of the first important examples in what is called the &lt;br/&gt;calculus of variations, first described by Euler. &lt;br/&gt;Physically minimal surfaces can be modeled locally as soap films on wires &lt;br/&gt;or by surfaces of least-area relative to local boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;These surfaces play an important role as a tool in the study of&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional topology and Riemannian geometry. &lt;br/&gt;The research in this proposal concerns global properties &lt;br/&gt;of these surfaces and possible applications &lt;br/&gt;to basic research in three-dimensional topology and geometry.</AbstractNarration>
