    <AbstractNarration>0139692 &lt;br/&gt;Hillery&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information is a new field that studies the representation and &lt;br/&gt;processing of information by quantum mechanical systems. Present computers, &lt;br/&gt;which are classical devices, represent information by bits, which can be &lt;br/&gt;either 0 or 1. A quantum computer represents information by qubits, which &lt;br/&gt;have the potential to be 0 and 1 simultaneously. This leads to profound &lt;br/&gt;differences in what can be done with classical and quantum information. In &lt;br/&gt;this project we will study programmable quantum information processing logic &lt;br/&gt;circuits. Most of the quantum circuits that have been proposed so far &lt;br/&gt;perform a single task. It is essential to go beyond this and to be able to &lt;br/&gt;design circuits with two inputs, one the data to be acted upon and the &lt;br/&gt;second, the program, that encodes the operation be performed. Both the data &lt;br/&gt;and the program are quantum states. These circuits can be either &lt;br/&gt;deterministic, succeeding in performing the desired operation all of the &lt;br/&gt;time, or probabilistic, performing the operation only some of the time. &lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic circuits can perform a much larger class of operations than can &lt;br/&gt;deterministic ones. We want to study how one can design circuits to perform &lt;br/&gt;specific sets of operations, how these operations are to best be encoded into &lt;br/&gt;quantum states, and how to optimize the probability of successfully &lt;br/&gt;performing the desired operation in a probabilistic processor.</AbstractNarration>
