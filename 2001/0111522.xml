    <AbstractNarration>Professor Amy Howell in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Connecticut is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for her research into the synthesis and reactivity of 2,3-dimethylenoxetanes and 1,5-dioxaspiro[3.2]hexanes. The conversion of 2,3-dimethylenoxetanes into highly functionalized ketones and enynols will be studied and these key intermediates will be used in syntheses of rubifolide, a furan cembrane, and a new approach to enediynes. The 1,5-dioxaspiro[3.2]hexanes will be utilized as intermediates in the preparation of nucleoside analogs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Program, Professor Howell is developing novel methods by which certain highly strained organic compounds can be further converted to nucleoside analogs and other natural products. The nucleoside analogs may have potential applications as new chemotherapeutic agents.</AbstractNarration>
