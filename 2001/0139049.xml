    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the Polytechnic University of New York for the support of a three-year, REU Site in Information Systems for Undergraduates, under the direction of Dr. Frank A. Cassara. This eleven-week summer program will involve twelve students annually in an intensive research experience on various projects in the area of information systems and electrophysics. Each student will be closely mentored by an individual faculty mentor who will plan work and review progress throughout the program. The students will benefit not only from extensive interactions with participating faculty, but also with graduate students. Participants will have informative tours of the institution's research laboratories and there will be two or three seminar presentations to the group by leaders from industry, universities or government agencies. The program will conclude with a research review during which each student will make a formal presentation and respond to questions. A formal final written report of professional quality will be required of all participants.</AbstractNarration>
