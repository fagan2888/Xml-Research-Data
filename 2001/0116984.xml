    <AbstractNarration>Optimal design, optimal control, and parameter estimation of systems governed by partial differen-tial&lt;br/&gt;equations give rise to a class of problems known as PDE-constrained optimization. The size and&lt;br/&gt;complexity of the discretized PDE constraints often pose significant challenges for contemporary&lt;br/&gt;optimization methods. Recent advances in algorithms, software, and high performance computing&lt;br/&gt;systems have resulted in PDE simulations that can often scale to millions of variables, thousands&lt;br/&gt;of processors, and multiple physics interactions. As PDE solvers mature, there is increasing in-dustrial&lt;br/&gt;and scientific interest in solving optimization problems governed by such large-scale PDE&lt;br/&gt;simulations.&lt;br/&gt;To address the challenges of these problems the investigators have organized a workshop on PDE-constrained&lt;br/&gt;optimization on April 4-6,2001, in Santa Fe, NM. The goals of the workshop are to identify the needs&lt;br/&gt;and opportunities for PDE-constrained optimization in industry and the national labs, to assess the state of the art in PDE-constrained optimization, to identify barriers to PDE-constrained optimization presented by&lt;br/&gt;modern simulation codes, and to discuss promising algorithmic and software approaches for overcoming these barriers.&lt;br/&gt;Sandia National Laboratories will sponsor the workshop itself. to expose a new generation of researchers to this rapidly growing area of research, the investigators will use this grant to support students attending&lt;br/&gt;and participating in the workshop.</AbstractNarration>
