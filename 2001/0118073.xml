    <AbstractNarration>This work is proposed as a starter grant to support a follow-on effort to PFSIVIETE fellowship&lt;br/&gt;grant number 9896381, "A Longitudinal Study of Eight Engineering Colleges using the&lt;br/&gt;SUCCEED Longitudinal Database." The primary goal of the original fellowship was to prioritize&lt;br/&gt;factors that contribute to engineering student success by studying programs designed to help&lt;br/&gt;engineering students at nine institutions. The breadth of data required to conduct such an analysis&lt;br/&gt;could not be collected within the fellowship tenure, so this greater goal remains a subject for&lt;br/&gt;continuing research. During the fellowship tenure, a number of individual studies were&lt;br/&gt;completed, and results from these have been published or are being developed in collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with the investigators who originally designed and implemented the programs under study. This&lt;br/&gt;request asks for support necessary to complete the study of data already collected and to collect&lt;br/&gt;additional data needed to begin to address the more aggressive goal of characterizing factors that&lt;br/&gt;contribute to engineering student success. The Southeastern University and College Coalition for&lt;br/&gt;Engineering Education (SUCCEED) will continue to significantly leverage this work.</AbstractNarration>
