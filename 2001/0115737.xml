    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides the American Mathematical Society with funds to be used over three years to support mathematically talented U.S. undergraduates for a semester of study at the MATH in MOSCOW program of&lt;br/&gt;the Independent University of Moscow. Funds will be used to underwrite approximately half of the typical cost for a semester of study in the program for ten undergraduate students per (academic) year. The Independent University of Moscow (IUM) is a small, elite institution of higher learning focusing primarily on mathematics. It was founded in 1991 at the initiative of a group of well-known Russian research mathematicians, who now comprise the Academic Council of the University. The faculty of the IUM has well-established connections with the research community in the U.S. and Europe. The costs to administer&lt;br/&gt;this program are being fully absorbed by the AMS, and all the funds provide will be used to support the students.</AbstractNarration>
