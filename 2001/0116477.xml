    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Drs. Lee and Underwood at California State&lt;br/&gt;University Long Beach to acquire an imaging system comprised of a fluorescence&lt;br/&gt;-capable microscope with motorized stage, CCD camera, computer, and software. &lt;br/&gt;This system will provide unbiased stereology capabilities, as well as the ability to &lt;br/&gt;1) visualize immunofluorescent labeled samples; 2) produce 3-dimensional (3-D)&lt;br/&gt;reconstructions; and 3) establish image databases accessible via the internet.&lt;br/&gt; The goal of Dr. Lee's research is to understand the effects of memory&lt;br/&gt;formation and hormones on neurogenesis in the zebra finch hippocampus. The&lt;br/&gt;hippocampus of adult birds and mammals retains the capacity for substantial&lt;br/&gt;plasticity including the birth of new cells (cytogenesis) and neurons&lt;br/&gt;(neurogenesis) in response to a number of environmental influences including&lt;br/&gt;learning and memory formation. Dr. Lee recently found that hippocampal cells&lt;br/&gt;are also born as a result of injury and collect around the damaged site in the&lt;br/&gt;zebra finch brain. Injured brain areas become rich in aromatase as well, an&lt;br/&gt;enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogen. Estrogens, in turn, are known&lt;br/&gt;to promote differentiation and survival of neurons. These intriguing results&lt;br/&gt;are being used to investigate factors influencing cytogenesis and&lt;br/&gt;differentiation of new cells into neurons and glia. The aim then is to exploit&lt;br/&gt;the ability of the avian hippocampus to respond to environmental influences by&lt;br/&gt;training birds on learning tasks, lesioning the hippocampus, injecting them&lt;br/&gt;with BrdU (a mitotic marker), and assessing the patterns of cell proliferation,&lt;br/&gt;migration, and/or differentiation through the use of immunohistochemical&lt;br/&gt;techniques. New BrdU-positive cells will be visualized and counted using the&lt;br/&gt;MicroBrightField StereoInvestigator imaging system; double labeling procedures&lt;br/&gt;will be used to determine whether new cells are neurons or glia.&lt;br/&gt; The goal of Dr. Underwood's research is to understand the relationship&lt;br/&gt;between chromosomal abnormalities, a biased sex ratio, and the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;"excess" males in the madrone butterfly. Dr. Underwood's research led to the&lt;br/&gt;discovery of abnormalities in chromosome pairing during germ cell formation in&lt;br/&gt;the madrone butterfly. One subspecies shows a normal complement of 26&lt;br/&gt;bivalents; however, another subspecies shows extreme variations from cell to&lt;br/&gt;cell within the same individual. The primary sex ratio of the abnormal&lt;br/&gt;subspecies is 75% male while the normal subspecies appears to have a normal sex&lt;br/&gt;ratio of 50% males. Butterflies have chromosomal sex determination.&lt;br/&gt;Spermatogenesis is extremely abnormal with multivalent chromosomal associations&lt;br/&gt;and lagging chromosomes formed during metaphase and anaphase, and the&lt;br/&gt;production of micronuclei associated with sperm nuclei.&lt;br/&gt; NSF funding will also make it possible to digitize samples obtained from a&lt;br/&gt;variety of research projects. This will result in public databases to be used&lt;br/&gt;by interested scientists with access to the internet and thus offers an&lt;br/&gt;unparalleled opportunity to share information both locally and globally.&lt;br/&gt;Individuals from multiple labs will perform procedures remotely thus broadening&lt;br/&gt;the scope of research and increasing the opportunity for publication and&lt;br/&gt;dissemination of results, while minimizing labor and the number of animals.&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the immediate research applications, instructors and their students will&lt;br/&gt;be empowered through accessibility to data previously reserved for only a&lt;br/&gt;select few. Image databases, accessed as classroom exercises, will expose&lt;br/&gt;students to topical and exciting new research as well as train them in the use&lt;br/&gt;of 21st century technology thus advancing science and giving them a competitive&lt;br/&gt;edge.</AbstractNarration>
