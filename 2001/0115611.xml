    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #0115611&lt;br/&gt;Wang, Paul S.&lt;br/&gt;Kent State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Following the NSF sponsored IAMC'99 Workshop and reinforcing an emerging research trend in making mathematical computation and data accessible on the Internet, the workshop provides a timely forum for researchers to further exchange ideas and discuss standards. The workshop will have invited talks, contributed papers, panel discussions, and system demonstrations. The results will be made available on the Web. An article overviewing the state of the art and future developments will be prepared for wide dissemination (e.g. publication in the magazine Science or Scientific American). An IAMC working group will be organized to foster research collaboration after the workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The IAMC workshop is being organized by Angel Diaz of IBM, Norbert Kajler of Ecole des Mines de Paris, and Paul S. Wang (the PI) of Kent State University as a pre-conference activity of ISSAC'01. The requested budget of $4,200 covers travel reimbursements and honoraria for invited speakers. With this support, the workshop will charge no registration fee for attendees. The workshop and this proposal have strong support from ISSAC'2001 organizers.</AbstractNarration>
