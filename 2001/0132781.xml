    <AbstractNarration>This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, supports a three-day workshop for about twenty graduate students and postdoctoral students that aims to prepare them to initiate careers at the college and university level. Professor Jespersen from Saint John's University and faculty from diverse institutions will host this workshop at the Fall 2001 Eastern Analytical Symposium meeting in New Jersey. Similar workshops will be offered in 2002 and 2003 with the goal of establishing the workshop as a traditional, self-sustaining component of the Eastern Analytical Symposium. The objective of this project is to make future college and university teachers more fully aware of the opportunities and responsibilities that will accompany this career choice so that they will be more successful. Of particular interest will be attracting women and minorities to academic careers and increasing their retention rates in the teaching profession.</AbstractNarration>
