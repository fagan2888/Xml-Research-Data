    <AbstractNarration>Bioluminescence the emission of light by living organisms is a fascinating phenomenon that&lt;br/&gt;has enchanted children and challenged those who have tried to fully understand it. Fireflies are&lt;br/&gt;examples of bioluminescent beetles capable of emitting light of various colors from green to red.&lt;br/&gt;The basic biochemistry of the firefly light emission process has many practical applications&lt;br/&gt;including drug development, clinical trials and food testing. This project will investigate the key&lt;br/&gt;firefly protein called luciferase that is responsible for the extraordinary biochemical light&lt;br/&gt;process. The research is designed to identify important components of firefly luciferase and to&lt;br/&gt;determine how specific amino acids work together to efficiently produce light of varying color.&lt;br/&gt;Molecular biology techniques will be used to create and evaluate new luciferase proteins. The&lt;br/&gt;results should contribute to a better understanding of firefly bioluminescence and the&lt;br/&gt;fundamental process by which living organisms convert chemical energy into light. The&lt;br/&gt;elucidation of the light-emitting process of firefly luciferase is important to the continued&lt;br/&gt;development of significant useful applications. Additionally, a better understanding of the firefly&lt;br/&gt;luciferase structure-function properties is important to fundamental biochemical processes with&lt;br/&gt;significant practical applications extending beyond the realm of bioluminescence. This project&lt;br/&gt;will be carried out at Connecticut College, a liberal arts college with a strong commitment to&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate research experiences. Previous bioluminescence work directed by the principal&lt;br/&gt;investigator for approximately 25 years has been highly appealing to undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;Professional and students participants in this project will be involved in modern mainstream&lt;br/&gt;biochemical and molecular biology research. It is expected that student participants will become&lt;br/&gt;scientists well prepared for entry into graduate programs and professional scientific careers.</AbstractNarration>
