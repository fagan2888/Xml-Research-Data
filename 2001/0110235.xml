    <AbstractNarration>This biennial conference focuses on the frontiers of science, and some of the resulting technology, in the field of thin films of organic materials. The principal themes of this year's conference are Single molecule phenomena, Thin film properties, Self-assembled surfaces, Patterned surfaces, Polyelectrolyte surfaces, Electroactive organic materials, Photonic band gap and reflective polymers, Colloidal crystals and Biological thin films. There is a definite emphasis on developing and exploiting the ability to build in a rich array of functionality and to control inter-particle and inter-surface potentials using organic materials. Advances in the science of thin films or organic materials opening up new areas of biomolecular science and biomimetic materials, creating new ways of displaying and communication information and developing new routes to functional materials.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;The structure of the conference will allow substantial time for discussion in that approximately 22 speakers have been invited, based on a plan to have 5 speakers per day Monday - Thursday, with 2 speakers in the opening session on Sunday evening. There will also be a poster session, given particular attention during the regular meeting time (currently planned for Tuesday morning), so that these important contributions get undivided attention early in the week to allow for substantial follow-up. A final novel feature will be a free-form discussion of key research challenges in organic thin film research, animated by a group of leaders in the field. There will also be 7 invited discussion leaders, in addition to the chair and vice chair, who will stimulate discussion at each of the sessions. The expectation is that at least 25% of the group of 29 invited speakers and discussion leaders, will be women or under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
