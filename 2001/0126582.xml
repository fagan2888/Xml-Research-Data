    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is addressing national and statewide needs to improve the mathematics skills of undergraduate students, particularly for 'at risk' members of 'special populations'. The project goal is to increase the retention and successful completion rates of community college algebra students by developing a collaborative, research-based approach to the improvement of teaching and learning mathematics. Project partners, Mesa, American River and West Valley Colleges are supported by both professional state mathematical organizations and the Center for Student Success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project objectives include adapting, pilot testing and evaluating three recommended approaches to increasing student success:&lt;br/&gt;1) adapting/refining a specialized mathematics study skills course developed at Manatee and Valencia Community Colleges in Florida;&lt;br/&gt;2) adapting/refining a teacher specific peer tutoring approach, Beacon; and&lt;br/&gt;3) supplementing the course with computer-aided instruction using ALEKS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is designed to adapt, implement, investigate and determine which of these strategies are effective with specific groups of 'at risk' community college students. Project objectives also include the development of a virtual resource center, regular partner meetings and a summer institute that is facilitating contact, communication and exchange of information among mathematics faculty members. The Project Resource Center is also being used as a clearinghouse for information regarding current research, available curriculum, instructional resources, and best practices for teaching Elementary Algebra. Project-produced educational materials, evaluation instruments, pilot test results and lessons learned are being disseminated.</AbstractNarration>
