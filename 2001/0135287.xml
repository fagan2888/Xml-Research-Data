    <AbstractNarration>This conference award to the University of Arizona is made by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division, the Electronic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research, and the Electronic and Communications System in the Engineering Directorate in support of the International Conference on Organic Nonlinear Optics VI (ICONO VI). The symposium in non-linear optics of organic and polymeric materials will provide a forum for discussion of recent developments and fundamental studies, and their applications in photonic technologies, devices and architectures. Previous ICONO meetings in different countries were widely attended, and brought together internationally distinguished researchers for discussion and interactions. These conferences have been very well received by participants, both national and international scientists, and are always oversubscribed. The planned conference is expected to provide a forum for discussion of ongoing and emerging areas of research and education among scientists with common interests in organic and polymeric materials with non-linear optical properties, and to promote dialog between industry, government and academic scientists from around the globe. Funds from NSF will be used to cover registration fees and some local expenses for attendees from historically black and minority institutions. Attempts also will be made by the organizers of the conference to encourage participation from other under-represented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Conference on organic Nonlinear Optics VI will provide a forum conducive to the development of ideas, help bridge gaps among the materials chemistry constituencies in academia, industry and government laboratories from around the globe, lead to new collaborations and define the frontiers of photonic materials based on polymers.</AbstractNarration>
