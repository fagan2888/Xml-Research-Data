    <AbstractNarration>SGER: The evolutionary genetics of avian choice behavior&lt;br/&gt;David W. Stephens&lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lay Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the feasibility of genetic studies of avian choice behavior. The project has two key goals. First, it will develop a system for testing the choice behavior of Coturnix quail that will allow the investigators to efficiently assay several aspects of choice behavior, such as how quickly food preferences develop, and how sensitive preferences are to differences in the timing and amount of food reward. The second goal of this project is to make preliminary estimates of the heritability of, and correlations between preference traits. These estimates will be made by comparing the measured "preference traits" of related individuals. In this study we will test half-sib families, that is, family groups in which a given pair of quail has the same father, but different mothers. This method allows us to exclude possible maternal effects. The resulting genetic estimates will allow us to make predictions about how choice behavior should respond to natural or artificial selection. Genetic correlations between traits provide information about the extent to which the different aspects of choice behavior are influenced by the same genes.</AbstractNarration>
