    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;There is a well-documented national need for development of curricula in bioinformatics, especially at the upper-division undergraduate level. This project is establishing a foundation course in bioinformatics for third-year undergraduates, articulated with the biological science major, and available as an elective course for chemistry, computer science, and physics majors interested in bioinformatics. Materials available through the California State University Program in Education and Research in Biotechnology (CSUPERB) Bioinformatics Consortium and the National Center for Biotechnology Information are being adapted for use in the course. The project also addresses the need to identify students having inadequate preparation for bioinformatics instruction and to provide just-in-time review materials. The objectives are: 1) to assemble, implement and field test a computer-based module for diagnostic pretesting and remediation for enrolling students, 2) to develop a set of problem-based instructional units to be used in a discussion/laboratory format with laptop computers and web browsers 3) to implement and evaluate an introductory course in bioinformatics using these materials, and 4) to share the results with faculty at other undergraduate institutions. The objectives are being accomplished using a systems approach to design, create and test materials appropriate for undergraduate bioinformatics. These materials are used with problem-based learning, enabling students to apply the strategies and tools of bioinformatics to topical problems drawn from current academic and commercial research. Basic computation, chemistry, biology, analytical and problem-solving skills are emphasized. The project involves several campuses of the California State University (CSU) system with the support from the CSU Program in Education and Research in Biotechnolgy (CSUPERB)Bioinformatics Consortium, which is committed to integration of technology and faculty development in the area of bioinformatics education.</AbstractNarration>
