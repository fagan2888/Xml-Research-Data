    <AbstractNarration>This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. The goal of the research is to explore the potential application of carbon nanotubes for greatly enhancing the efficiency of existing microarray devices in biological/biomedical research. The proposed work will synthesize arrays of well-aligned carbon nanotubes that can be used to transfer biomolecules from the tips of the nanotubes for creating microarrays at a level of packing density not achievable by current techniques. Carbon nanotubes are uniquely suited for this application owing to their extremely high elastic modulus and strength as well as exceptional capability in sustaining large nonlinear elastic deformation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a preliminary feasibility study of a novel idea in nanoscience and engineering with focuses on nanoscale devices and systems architecture, and modeling and simulation at the nanoscale. The effort is likely to catalyze rapid advances in biological/biomedical research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of this exploratory research are to (a) better understand the growth of aligned carbon nanotubes for achieving optimal control of their length, diameter, and packing density &lt;br/&gt;in microarrays, (b) better understand the structures and performance of individual nanotubes &lt;br/&gt;as well as microarrays through microscopic and mechanical characterizations, (c) initiate computational mechanics effort at both the continuum and atomistic levels for modeling the &lt;br/&gt;nano-structure, chirality, and mechanical behavior of nanotubes, (d) develop the tools and criteria for assessing the performance of this novel microarray device for biological/biomedical research, and (e) evaluate the feasibility of the nanotube-based microarray devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that this project will advance microarray technology to enable more rapid study by biological and biomedical investigators in areas of genetic research. Ultimately,this technology may result in advancements in the study and treatment of human disease. Fundamentalinvestigations on synthesis, characterization, and property modeling of carbon nanotubes will benefit the technology of nanotube synthesis and engineering. Better understanding of nanotube growth mechanisms will enable improved synthesis and control of the nanotube structure. Development of structure/property models for mechanical behavior of carbon nanotubes, along with synthesis/structure relationships, will ultimately provide a tool for engineering their mechanical properties.</AbstractNarration>
