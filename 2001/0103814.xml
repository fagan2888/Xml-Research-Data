    <AbstractNarration>STOCHASTIC MODELS FOR QUEUEING AND FINANCE&lt;br/&gt;NSF Proposal: DMS-0103814&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Steven E. Shreve&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Work is proposed in two areas. The first is the analysis of queueing&lt;br/&gt;systems with deadlines under heavy traffic conditions. Consider a&lt;br/&gt;queueing system with renewal process arrival streams. Suppose that&lt;br/&gt;upon arrival, each customer is assigned a lead time, the amount of time&lt;br/&gt;until the customer's deadline for service elapses. One can model the lead&lt;br/&gt;times of the customers in queue at a station as a counting measure on the&lt;br/&gt;real line, the location of the point masses corresponding to customer lead&lt;br/&gt;times. Research will address the convergence of these measure-valued&lt;br/&gt;processes under heavy-traffic scaling. Research will also be directed to&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models for finance. On such model is for an option on a&lt;br/&gt;traded account. For the simplest of these, an account trading one&lt;br/&gt;underlying geometric Brownian motion and a constant-interest-rate money&lt;br/&gt;market, there is a strikingly simple optimal rule: hold the geometric&lt;br/&gt;Brownian motion long when the account value is negative and short when&lt;br/&gt;the account value is positive. For an option on two geometric Brownian&lt;br/&gt;motions, there is a conjectured optimal rule, which is supported by&lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis. The proof appears to require the development of new&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. A second mathematical finance problem concerns the&lt;br/&gt;development of a unifying model for risk-neutral pricing of credit&lt;br/&gt;derivatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has two parts. The subject of the first part, queueing&lt;br/&gt;systems with deadlines, arise in communication networks, especially&lt;br/&gt;networks used to transmit digitized video or audio signals. Data which&lt;br/&gt;are too long delayed can cause unacceptable disruption of the signal.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide a basis for performance analysis of&lt;br/&gt;heavily-loaded communication networks which take deadlines into account.&lt;br/&gt;The subject of the second part, mathematical models for finance, builds on&lt;br/&gt;the revolution in finance begun by the Black-Scholes option pricing &lt;br/&gt;formula. The particular work proposed here is concerned with proper&lt;br/&gt;pricing and usage of financial instruments whose purpose is to insure&lt;br/&gt;against loss, either due to drastic reduction in market value (options on&lt;br/&gt;a traded account) or default (credit derivatives).</AbstractNarration>
