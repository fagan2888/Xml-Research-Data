    <AbstractNarration>Project Title: Competitive Analysis of Online Algorithms for Computer &lt;br/&gt;Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on algorithms that work&lt;br/&gt;with limited information. Each topic is motivated by an application&lt;br/&gt;in on-line resource allocation in computer systems and is studied&lt;br/&gt;using theoretical analysis as well as empirical evaluation.&lt;br/&gt;The first topic is focuses on&lt;br/&gt;designing protocols for power management.&lt;br/&gt;The second topic of this research addresses problems&lt;br/&gt;that arise in scheduling and load balancing for multimedia servers.&lt;br/&gt;The third topic focuses on the problem of balancing the use of&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth and storage in caching continuous multi-media objects&lt;br/&gt;for Web proxy servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the power management topic, the question addressed is when to move&lt;br/&gt;an idle device to a lower power consumption state so as to&lt;br/&gt;conserve power usage while minimizing the latency experienced by the&lt;br/&gt;user. The investigator expands upon previous work on power management by&lt;br/&gt;introducing the notion of latency and by studying systems with multiple&lt;br/&gt;levels of power usage. The work on multimedia scheduling and load&lt;br/&gt;balancing focuses on two problems. The first is scheduling transmission&lt;br/&gt;of data that must be viewed continuously when clients have large&lt;br/&gt;buffers that can store data transmitted ahead of time.&lt;br/&gt;The second problem is to perform load balancing in assigning&lt;br/&gt;tasks to servers when there are multiple resource requirements&lt;br/&gt;that need to be balanced. For the topic of caching continuous&lt;br/&gt;multi-media objects for Web proxy servers, the challenge&lt;br/&gt;is that continuous data must be transmitted to the client in a&lt;br/&gt;continuous sequential stream. To support the real time requirements&lt;br/&gt;of streaming, web caches need to reserve bandwidth as well as space&lt;br/&gt;for each request for a continuous data object.&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates algorithms for balancing these&lt;br/&gt;two resources.</AbstractNarration>
