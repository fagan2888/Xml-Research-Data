    <AbstractNarration>In this Career project, the investigator creates a software&lt;br/&gt;platform (called NLApack) for Numerical Algebraic Geometry,&lt;br/&gt;trains students in the development and application of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical software, and broadens the graduate education of&lt;br/&gt;students in the areas of mathematics, computational science, and&lt;br/&gt;engineering. In a first stage, the algorithms for the numerical&lt;br/&gt;irreducible decomposition of the solution set of a polynomial&lt;br/&gt;system are refined and combined into a blackbox program. Besides&lt;br/&gt;software, another outcome of this stage is the development of a&lt;br/&gt;textbook for a course introducing students to symbolic and&lt;br/&gt;scientific computing. The second stage of the project focuses on&lt;br/&gt;three specific topics: pole placement, overconstrained linkages,&lt;br/&gt;and multi-body dynamics. A result of this stage is a collection&lt;br/&gt;of software tools specialized for those application fields, case&lt;br/&gt;studies, and benchmarks. Throughout, students are trained in&lt;br/&gt;mathematics and computing and in important applications areas.&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator, his collaborators, and his&lt;br/&gt;graduate students are working in the areas of numerical analysis&lt;br/&gt;and computer algebra. While computer algebra solves mathematical&lt;br/&gt;problems in an exact symbolic fashion, as one would by hand,&lt;br/&gt;numerical analysis calculates with limited precision on input&lt;br/&gt;data often only approximately known. The software developed in&lt;br/&gt;this project combines the symbolic and numeric approach. Most&lt;br/&gt;scientists seek insight (not just numbers) in the form of&lt;br/&gt;equations to reveal new relations between the important&lt;br/&gt;parameters in their models. But these models contain approximate&lt;br/&gt;data that cannot be handled directly by current symbolic methods.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator develops symbolic-numeric methods that will&lt;br/&gt;make computer algebra more relevant to scientific computing, and&lt;br/&gt;trains students who will adept at both numeric and symbolic&lt;br/&gt;computation, with significant payoffs for disciplines that depend&lt;br/&gt;on large-scale scientific computing.</AbstractNarration>
