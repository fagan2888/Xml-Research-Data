    <AbstractNarration>This research program concerns questions at the intersection of&lt;br/&gt;commutative algebra, integer programming, and discrete geometry. The&lt;br/&gt;link between these fields is made via toric ideals and their Groebner&lt;br/&gt;bases. The first set of questions concern the characterization and&lt;br/&gt;construction of toric initial ideals without embedded primes. Answers&lt;br/&gt;to these questions will provide new structural results in the theory&lt;br/&gt;of integer programming via the classical technique of group&lt;br/&gt;relaxations due to Gomory and will extend recent work in this area by&lt;br/&gt;Serkan Hosten and the proposer. The second set of questions concern &lt;br/&gt;the toric Hilbert scheme, a parameter space for all polynomial ideals&lt;br/&gt;with the same multi-graded Hilbert function as a given toric ideal. A&lt;br/&gt;central open question about these schemes is whether they are&lt;br/&gt;connected. The proposer will work with Diane Maclagan on this &lt;br/&gt;connectivity question, building on their recent construction of a&lt;br/&gt;graph on the monomial ideals of the scheme which is connected if and&lt;br/&gt;only if the scheme is connected. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade, the proposer has contributed to the development&lt;br/&gt;of several new theories in discrete optimization using algebraic&lt;br/&gt;techniques and has worked on the application of the resulting,&lt;br/&gt;non-traditional algorithms to practical problems. The research that&lt;br/&gt;has contributed to these theories brings tools from algebra,&lt;br/&gt;combinatorics, optimization and discrete geometry to bear on problems&lt;br/&gt;from all of these fields. The application of algebraic techniques has&lt;br/&gt;led to new understanding in the field of integer programming, a branch&lt;br/&gt;of discrete optimization, but tools and ideas from optimization have&lt;br/&gt;also led to new results in algebra. This interplay of ideas and&lt;br/&gt;techniques has shed light on questions from each of these areas and&lt;br/&gt;promises to lead to greater insight and advancement. The proposer&lt;br/&gt;works with students on some of the computational aspects of the&lt;br/&gt;research and plans to involve students in the development of software&lt;br/&gt;that implements these algorithms. The proposer is also interested in&lt;br/&gt;curriculum development in subject areas related to this research at&lt;br/&gt;the University of Washington.</AbstractNarration>
