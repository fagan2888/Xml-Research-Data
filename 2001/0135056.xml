    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: PECASE: The Utilization of Complex Molecule Synthesis to Drive the Development of New Reaction Methods that Promote New Directions in Synthesis. A 'Teufelskreis' of Opportunity.&lt;br/&gt;Institution: California Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of this research is to develop new synthetic methodology in the context of complex molecule synthesis. Projects involving palladium-catalyzed oxidative [4+2] cycloaddition reactions and tandem Bamford-Stevens/Claisen rearrangements will be carried out and a concise, stereoselective route to the hypoglycemogenic diterpenoid, saudin will be developed. In the educational realm, courses on synthesis and pharmaceutical chemistry are being developed and outreach activities enabling students to interact with the broader local community are in place.&lt;br/&gt;With this PECASE award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational efforts of Dr. Brian Stoltz of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology. Professor Stoltz will focus his research on the development of new synthetic methodology within the framework of natural product total synthesis. The illustrative target molecule, saudin, has interesting biological properties of interest to the pharmaceutical industry. The education activities will stress outreach to local middle schools and high schools and will also focus on course development at the undergraduate and graduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project was originally funded as a CAREER award, and was converted to a Presidential Early Career Award for Engineers and Scientists (PECASE) award in May 2004.</AbstractNarration>
