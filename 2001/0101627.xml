    <AbstractNarration>A consortium of seven community colleges in Texas, lead by the College of the Mainland, along with their local high schools and industries are planning to address the development of a workforce with skills and knowledge in e-business. The necessary skills and competencies for jobs in e-business are assessed using the DACUM process and curricula are developed to provide a common technical core with four exit options - technical support, programming, graphic arts and security. The planning establishes a statewide industry/education partnership that possesses a broad grasp of the Internet economy. A partnership memorandum of understanding assures that each derives benefit. Presentations are made to strengthen public awareness and gain support.</AbstractNarration>
