    <AbstractNarration>0118046 Talley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce a printed and an online atlas of the Indian Ocean WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) Hydrographic Program (WHP) data. The goals of the Indian Ocean WHP were similar to those for the other basins -to obtain basic hydrographic and chemical tracer data to allow basin-wide estimates of transports. Specific goals included obtaining as much information as possible about Indian Ocean overturning and quantifying the throughput of near-surface water from the Pacific to the Atlantic. The project requires acquiring and processing the Indian Ocean WHP data sets from the WHP Office (WHPO), assisting the WHPO if needed in completing these data sets, gridding, plotting each of the WHP parameters, providing online access to the preliminary graphics for interaction with the individual investigators, final drafting of the plots, and forwarding to the International WOCE Project Office in Southampton for printing. Online atlas development will proceed in parallel with that for the Pacific, Southern Ocean and Atlantic. The printed WHP atlases will likely also contain maps showing the mean flow and statistics from the Lagrangian float and drifter measurements. If included, the mapped values will be provided by the float and drifter groups.</AbstractNarration>
