    <AbstractNarration>Children live in complex economic environments. They make choices about what&lt;br/&gt;to consume and they earn money. Children save, exchange goods, make&lt;br/&gt;decisions under uncertainty, and they share and bargain among themselves and&lt;br/&gt;with their parents and other adults. There are two main reasons why it is&lt;br/&gt;important to improve our understanding of these sorts of economic behavior&lt;br/&gt;in children. First, a better understanding of the development of children's&lt;br/&gt;economic behavior will lead to a better understanding of economic behavior&lt;br/&gt;in adults. Many economic norms, habits, and preferences are acquired in&lt;br/&gt;childhood and this study will improve our understanding of how these&lt;br/&gt;develop. Second, many of the decisions children make have consequences for&lt;br/&gt;the rest of their lives. We believe that an understanding of children's&lt;br/&gt;behavior based on economics will make it possible for society to help&lt;br/&gt;children make better decisions as children.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first goal of our research is to determine whether economic models are&lt;br/&gt;applicable to children. If so, at what age does economics become useful for&lt;br/&gt;understanding which different aspects of children's behavior? Second, we&lt;br/&gt;will use computer based economic experiments to construct a panel data set&lt;br/&gt;that will provide basic information on how children's economic behaviors,&lt;br/&gt;such as rationality, altruism, risk behaviors, and bargaining, develop with&lt;br/&gt;age. Our third objective is to develop an understanding of how demographic&lt;br/&gt;variables and family policies influence children's preferences and economic&lt;br/&gt;skills. A very practical and important benefit of this research will be a&lt;br/&gt;better understanding of how parents, schools, and society can better prepare&lt;br/&gt;children for the complex economic environment they will face as adults.&lt;br/&gt;Currently there is almost no research on how children acquire economic&lt;br/&gt;skills. Parents rely on information from folklore, their own experience, and&lt;br/&gt;advice from unscientific studies and reports. Schools do not explicitly&lt;br/&gt;teach what we, as economists, would regard as some of the most important&lt;br/&gt;economic skills. Children are left to acquire basic economic decision making&lt;br/&gt;skills haphazardly. This research will provide some of the basic descriptive&lt;br/&gt;information needed to improve this situation.</AbstractNarration>
