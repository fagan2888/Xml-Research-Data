    <AbstractNarration>The Investigator studies intersection theory on and the&lt;br/&gt;cohomological field theory arising from the moduli of algebraic&lt;br/&gt;spin curves and stable spin maps. Especially important in this&lt;br/&gt;study is the exploration of the plethora of similarities between&lt;br/&gt;Gromov-Witten theory and cohomological field arising from higher&lt;br/&gt;spin curves and spin maps. Also important in this research is the&lt;br/&gt;study of the many relations between these cohomological field&lt;br/&gt;theories and integrable hierarchies, including significant recent&lt;br/&gt;progress toward proving some remarkable conjectures like the&lt;br/&gt;W-algebra conjecture and Generalized Witten Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research in this project is concerned with connections between&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry and physics, and it has implications for both&lt;br/&gt;subjects. Algebraic geometry, which is the study of solutions to&lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations, and especially the sub-discipline of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic curves, which is one of the main foci of this research,&lt;br/&gt;have many applications. The most notable of these applications&lt;br/&gt;are in secure electronic communications (cryptography and error&lt;br/&gt;correcting codes). Recent research has shown that algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry also has significant ties to high-energy physics and&lt;br/&gt;plays an important role in helping us understand the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;nature of the universe. Conversely, physics has helped us better&lt;br/&gt;understand some important aspects of algebraic geometry and its&lt;br/&gt;applications. This research is focused on studying and further&lt;br/&gt;developing some of these important links.</AbstractNarration>
