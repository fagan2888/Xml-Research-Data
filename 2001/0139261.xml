    <AbstractNarration>Fundamental problems are addressed in wavelet theory, non-uniform&lt;br/&gt;sampling, frames, and the theory of spectral-tile duality. These&lt;br/&gt;problems are inextricably interwoven by concept and&lt;br/&gt;technique. Operator theory provides the major unifying framework,&lt;br/&gt;combined with an integration of ideas from a diverse spectrum of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics including classical Fourier analysis, noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;harmonic analysis, representation theory, operator algebras,&lt;br/&gt;approximation theory, and signal processing. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;construction, implementation, and ensuing theory of single dyadic&lt;br/&gt;orthonormal wavelets in Euclidean space requires significant input&lt;br/&gt;from all of these disciplines as well as deep spectral-tile &lt;br/&gt;results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is intrinsic mathematical importance in the aforementioned &lt;br/&gt;problems, and the solutions to be formulated have broad and &lt;br/&gt;creative implications, both for mathematics and for applications &lt;br/&gt;in engineering and physics. The topics of this project have &lt;br/&gt;direct bearing on fast acquisition and motion problems in MRI, &lt;br/&gt;as well as in formulating algorithms for compression and noise &lt;br/&gt;reduction by means of proper cochlear modelling. There are further&lt;br/&gt;applications in quantum computing and image processing, and the &lt;br/&gt;development of non-uniform sampling strategies by this project &lt;br/&gt;play a role in state of the art A/D conversion methods used in &lt;br/&gt;multifunction RF systems. These interdisciplinary applications &lt;br/&gt;depending on modern mathematical analysis have educational &lt;br/&gt;implications in terms of cross-fertilization of ideas and research&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
