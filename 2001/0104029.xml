    <AbstractNarration>This project is dedicated to the study of uniqueness and stability in&lt;br/&gt;some important inverse problems, in particular to identification of diffusion coefficients&lt;br/&gt;and the speed of propagation for scalar partial differential equations and (Maxwell and&lt;br/&gt;elasticity)systems. Tools will be new Carleman type estimates and&lt;br/&gt;interaction between control theory and inverse problems. Also potential&lt;br/&gt;theory is to be utilized in the further study of inverse gravimetry and&lt;br/&gt;vorticity problems. In case of many boundary measurements the effort will be&lt;br/&gt;made to resolve the fundamental uniqueness question in the inverse&lt;br/&gt;conductivity problem with the data on a part of the boundary by using&lt;br/&gt;localized solutions of elliptic equations recently constructed by Greenleaf&lt;br/&gt;and Uhlmann. The PI will try to find cases of increased stability in inverse&lt;br/&gt;problems, in particular obtaining Lipschitz conditional stability estimates for&lt;br/&gt;recovery of nonlinear (space independent) elliptic and parabolic equations&lt;br/&gt;from boundary measurements and quantifying increased stability in&lt;br/&gt;prospecting by stationary waves with higher frequency.&lt;br/&gt; Applications of theoretical results will be in identification of volatility in options markets. We expect to develop a very efficient and reliable algorithm based on the modeling of volatility. This problem is of fundamental importance for prediction of options markets and evaluation of economical stability from current market data. Another expected application is recovery of the fundamental physical relations (in chemical equations, heat conduction) from experimental data. This problem is of growing importance for contemporary engineering due to the discovery of new materials and the use of high temperatures.&lt;br/&gt;The theory of inverse gravimetry combined with available models of vorticity is expected to achieve progress in evaluation of turbulence (e.g. past aircrafts) from distant measurements of pressure. This problem has important implications for increasing capability of large airports. The project will involve graduate students and stimulate their interest in mathematical problems of practical importance.</AbstractNarration>
