    <AbstractNarration>ITR/\(PE+SY\): Responsive Virtual Human Technology Research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Responsive virtual human technology (RVHT) is used in diverse fields (computer generated forces, manufacturing, medicine, theater), but not for interaction skills training. Yet interaction skills are usually critical. Specific situations identified where improved interaction skills would be important include: &lt;br/&gt;Medical practitioners taking patient histories or interacting with children;&lt;br/&gt;Law officers handling crisis situations involving mental illness, trauma, or violence; and Military officers interviewing refugees or settling stressed civilians.&lt;br/&gt;This project will address multiple research issues relevant for RVHT to reach the sophistication required for robust interaction skills training. Important questions to be answered include:&lt;br/&gt; How is behavior modeled under normal conditions (i.e., a calm adult) and derivative conditions (e.g., anger, schizophrenia, pain, and childhood)?&lt;br/&gt; What expressions, gestures, movement, and other behaviors will users interpret as serene, angry, schizophrenic, pained, or childlike?&lt;br/&gt;What skills can be acquired, practiced, and validated using RVHT? What is involved in providing a convincing simulation of human interaction where acquired skills transfer to a live environment?&lt;br/&gt;The research results will expose a range of additional training and educational opportunities, such as interviewing risky behavior and presenting rare, traumatic events. Combinations of RVHT-based training and instructor-led training offer significantly reduced training development and delivery costs, and increased student throughput, while maintaining training effectiveness and consistency.</AbstractNarration>
