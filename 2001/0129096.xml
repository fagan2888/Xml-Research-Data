    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal 0129096&lt;br/&gt;David J. Lovell&lt;br/&gt;University of Maryland College Park&lt;br/&gt;SGER - 3-D Sight Distance Computation&lt;br/&gt;August 1, 2001&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes exploratory research aimed at solving a perpetual transportation design problem - the automated and efficient measurement of available sight distance for three-dimensional highway alignments. This is an important problem in its own right because of the growing need to automate design feasibility test and evaluation for highways due to workforce reductions. Automation is thwarted by the computational complexity of the problems. If successful, research the results will be a more efficient algorithmic to the sight distance problem and improved highway design evaluation, selection and safety. This will have a significant impact on the transportation community, including universities, public and private agencies such as roadway construction and maintenance, traffic operations, safety. Additionally the mathematical framework required to solve the problem can support a number of other investigations, such as clear zone widths, passing lane demarcations, etc.</AbstractNarration>
