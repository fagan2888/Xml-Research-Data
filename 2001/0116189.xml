    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Holly Boettger-Tong at Wesleyan College, an undergraduate liberal arts college for women, to acquire an imaging workstation. The specific components of this imaging workstation include an imaging research microscope with digital camera, combined with imaging software capable of high resolution image acquisition and morphologic analysis capabilities. A scanning laser densitometer, with software capable of quantifying stained electrophoresis gels, blotting membranes and autoradiographs is also an integral component of this workstation. Acquisition of this equipment is vital to the research activities of the Biology faculty, and represents a significant improvement in our ongoing efforts to integrate education and research by introducing students to modern technologies which they will use to develop independent research projects. In collaboration with faculty, students will explore the role of cytoskeletal signaling in spermatogenesis, fertilization and early development. In addition, students will examine the regulation of gene expression in epithelial tissues during differentiation. This instrumentation will greatly enhance the research training opportunities available at Wesleyan College and will directly translate into more opportunities for scientific discovery by both faculty and undergraduate researchers. &lt;br/&gt; At Wesleyan College, the Biology department curriculum is student-centered, with specific emphasis on student-directed research experiences. Students gain these experiences working as research assistants with department faculty, and through independent research projects in upper division Biology courses. Basic research applications of the equipment will include use of the Axioplan II and imaging software for molecular and immunohistochemical studies to analyze the expression pattern of select cytoskeletal proteins in the reproductive tract and during early development. In addition, the scanning densitometry equipment and software will be used for quantitation of mRNA expression by Northern blotting, as well as the comparison of levels of mRNA expression with protein expression by densitometry of Western blots. This equipment will also serve to modernize courses in Histology, Developmental Biology, Genetics, Cell and Molecular Biology and DNA Technology. &lt;br/&gt; Acquisition of this image analysis workstation will assist the Biology faculty at Wesleyan College in their goal of successfully providing women with excellent research opportunities using modern scientific methods. As a culturally diverse (35% minority) College, Wesleyan recognizes that it has a unique opportunity to favorably impact the recruitment of minority women into the sciences. This equipment will make a direct impact on the preparation of young women for careers in the sciences and will greatly enhance their competitiveness for admission at quality postgraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
