    <AbstractNarration>During the summers of 2002-2004 the Department of Biology at Marquette University will sponsor a ten-week NSF-REU site program. Twelve undergraduate students, who have completed their sophomore or junior year, will be selected to work with individual faculty in the areas of microbiology, molecular and cellular biology, developmental biology, neurobiology and vertebrate physiology. The program is designed to provide a hands-on research experience that will enhance the students' appreciation of experimental science and increase their ability to work independently in a research environment. This program is also intended to encourage students to pursue careers in science and research and to foster the participation of women, members of underrepresented minority groups and persons with disabilities. Each participant will help design and carry out a research project during the summer and, at the end of the program, prepare a report and present research findings at an undergraduate research symposium. In addition to their research activities, students will participate in a variety of program-sponsored activities including a journal club, seminars by visiting speakers and workshops on contemporary ethical issues in biology and medicine. The program will thus provide its participants with a unique experience that will enhance their insight into the scientific process, facilitate their career decisions and, ultimately, positively impact their contributions to science and society. Further information on the program and application procedures is available at the department website (http://mendel.biol.mu.edu) or by contacting the Program Director, Dr. Stephen H. Munroe (telephone 414-288-1485; e-mail stephen.munroe@marquette.edu).</AbstractNarration>
