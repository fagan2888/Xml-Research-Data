    <AbstractNarration>The purpose of this proposal is to enhance the partnership between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the graduate community by creating a new mechanism for ongoing and substantive communications between senior administrators at our universities providing graduate education and the NSF. Based on the model of the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) Dean in Residence Program, we propose to establish a NSF/CGS Dean in Residence. Selected through a national competition developed and administered by the Council of Graduate Schools, the NSF-CGS Dean in Residence, would interact with program officers in the Division of Graduate Education (DGE) and in other divisions of the Directorate for Eduction and Human Resources, with program officers and managers in the research directorates at NSF, as well as with senior officials at the National Science Foundation. Working though CGS the dean would, in turn, share with the graduate dean community and with the broader science and engineering faculty NSF's perspective on graduate education, particularly but not exclusively those aspects of graduate education that NSF is attempting to strengthen or redirect through its portfolio. The program will serve as a national model that could be adopted by other federal agencies in the future.</AbstractNarration>
