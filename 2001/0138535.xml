    <AbstractNarration>This Chemistry Division award supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Furman University. Timothy Hanks is the site's Program Director and Moses Lee is the Co-Program Director. Twelve faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Over the award period (2002-2004), ten students will be supported each summer in a ten-week program. Of these students, 4-6 will be from regional institutions with limited research opportunities and at least 50% will be from NSF-targeted demographic groups. Another feature of the program is that a faculty member will accompany up to three of the visiting students and will serve as research mentors. The research focus of the program will be on nanoscience projects in one of three special interest groups: Monolayers and Surfaces, Supramolecuar Structures and DNA Complexes. All participants (students and research mentors) will provide a written evaluation of the program at its conclusion. In addition, the program will monitor the number of their REU students that pursue graduate degrees and the number of student co-authored publications in professional and peer reviewed journals.</AbstractNarration>
