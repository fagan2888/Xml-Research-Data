    <AbstractNarration>Web-based three-tier diagnostic tests to assess misconceptions held by undergraduate biology students are being developed. Misconceptions hinder students' understanding of complex, abstract scientific concepts, yet many faculty and students themselves are unaware of these misconceptions. This project is producing a web-based assessment tool for general biology courses to provide rapid diagnosis and individualize feedback, which can be easily adaptable for other institutions.&lt;br/&gt;As a result, science education is being improved in two ways. Identification of&lt;br/&gt;misconceptions is the first step in evoking conceptual change. Diagnosing misconceptions is critical in helping students develop more scientifically accurate conceptual understanding, which ultimately improves performance in undergraduate science courses and reduces attrition. Second, results from this diagnostic instrument help faculty to recognize the types of misconceptions that students hold, thereby helping faculty to tailor instruction and laboratory activities to confront the misconceptions. Assessment results are driving curricular change.</AbstractNarration>
