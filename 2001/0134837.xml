    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER project at CUNY City College will experimentally explore the region of applicability of kinetic theory applied to idealized and industrially relevant granular materials. Granular systems are collections of particles that typically dissipate energy in collisions. A fundamental understanding of these materials, comparable to our current understanding of fluids and solids, does not exist today but would have far reaching impacts across many industries, such as energy production, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. The assumptions used to derive granular continuum equations for mass, momentum, and energy balance, by analogy to normal fluids but including energy dissipation, are clearly violated for some of these granular systems. The goal of the experiments is to determine the conditions under which these equations produce quantitatively accurate results and to modify the assumptions to encompass a broader range of situations. The simple visual nature of these experiments creates an ideal opportunity to incorporate research into the undergraduate and graduate science curriculum through a combination of individual focused research opportunities, an advanced research methods course, and a granular materials course. The students and post-docs involved in the project will receive training in cutting edge research methods and will be well prepared for careers in academe, industry and government&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER development at CUNY City College project will experimentally determine the region of applicability of competing theories of granular materials for both idealized and industrially relevant systems and will incorporate this research experience into the science curriculum. Granular materials are collections of small particles, such sand in an hourglass or grains in a silo. A fundamental understanding of granular systems, comparable to our current understanding of fluids and solids, does not exist today but would have far reaching impacts across many industries, such as energy production, food processing, and pharmaceuticals. The basic assumptions used to derive current theories of granular flow are similar to those of normal fluids but are clearly violated for some granular systems. The goal of these experiments is to determine the conditions under which these theories can be used to calculate accurate results and to extend the theories to encompass a broader range of situations. The simple visual nature of these experiments creates an ideal opportunity to incorporate research into the undergraduate and graduate science curriculum through a combination of individual focused research opportunities, an advanced research methods course, and a granular materials course.
