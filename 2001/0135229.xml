    <AbstractNarration>Nehrir, M. Hashem&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to explore modeling and control of multi-source wind/photovoltaic (PV)/fuel cell distributed generation systems to evaluate and improve their performance. Proper dynamic models of different generation devices (i.e., wind generator, PV arrays, storage batteries and fuel cells) involved will be developed. Special attention will be put on studying the electrical characteristics of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells for applications such as electric motor starting, load switching and/or rejection to explore their dynamic behavior and design controllers to enhance their response and efficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamic model of different generation devices will be integrated to form a multi-sourced distributed generation model whose dynamic performance will also be explored. Based on this dynamic response, a transient classifier will be designed to manage power flows from different generation sources with the objective of increasing the overall system efficiency and reliability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economic benefits of both single-source and multi-source systems will also be evaluated.</AbstractNarration>
