    <AbstractNarration>This award supports international collaboration on electrospinning of novel polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers. Research into the electrospinning of polymer nanofibers and their applications in composites is currently being conducted by the investigator at the University of Nebraska. This collaboration with researchers at the Institute of Polymer Science at the University of Stellenbosh in South Africa brings complimentary expertise in the synthesis, modification and characterization of these PAN nanofibers. In addition, modeling and theoretical optimization of nanofiber assemblies for improved thermal stability and reduced residual stresses will be performed at the University of Natal-Durban, South Africa. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active participation between the research groups includes graduate student participation and student exchanges. It is expected that this will lead to advances in nanotechnology and to extended collaborations as this research moves forward.</AbstractNarration>
