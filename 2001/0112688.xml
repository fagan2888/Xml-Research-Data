    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information Technology Research (ITR)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small Proposal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Id: EIA-0112688&lt;br/&gt;Investigator: Denis Lee&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Suffolk University&lt;br/&gt;Title: ITR/PE: Knowledge Acquisition and Effective Development of Information Technologies/Systems Workers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a 3-year research study to examine the changing knowledge and skill requirements for different types of Information Technology (IT) /Information Systems (IS) work. It will investigate how IT/IS workers acquire the knowledge and information they need for their work and how they coordinate their work effort with colleagues. It will analyze various important mechanisms that might facilitate or inhibit these processes. Finally it will also relate these work-based learning behaviors of IT/IS workers to their demographic and educational background as well as to performances, professional development and turnover.</AbstractNarration>
