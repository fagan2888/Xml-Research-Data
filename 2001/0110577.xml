    <AbstractNarration>0110577&lt;br/&gt;Riley&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the Gordon Research Conference on Nuclear&lt;br/&gt;Chemistry is to provide the international community of nuclear&lt;br/&gt;scientists with a unique forum in which the newest developments at the&lt;br/&gt;forefront of this science can be presented and subjected to detailed and&lt;br/&gt;extended discussions and criticism. The purpose of the conference is to&lt;br/&gt;encourage communication and the discussions to be conducted in an&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere conducive to open interactions between the scientists,&lt;br/&gt;provoking new and even speculative ideas for future research. To&lt;br/&gt;accomplish these goals requires the participation in all of the&lt;br/&gt;conference activities of a significant number of leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;However, a science as rapidly developing as nuclear chemistry invites&lt;br/&gt;and needs cooperative efforts on all levels, including efforts both&lt;br/&gt;national and worldwide in scope. The participation of younger&lt;br/&gt;scientists is essential to address the future manpower needs of this&lt;br/&gt;rapidly changing field. Therefore, bright and promising postdoctoral&lt;br/&gt;researchers and graduate students have been specially selected for&lt;br/&gt;participation in this conference and encouraged to present their ideas. &lt;br/&gt;Their participation in this conference provides them with unique and&lt;br/&gt;extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to new&lt;br/&gt;research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the&lt;br/&gt;leadership roles they will assume in the future. This award will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate participation from these junior scientists.</AbstractNarration>
