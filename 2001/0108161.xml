    <AbstractNarration>Specimen data about mammals exist in a large number of institutions. Until now, there has been no integrated approach so that a researcher might move through various collections for research. Here, seventeen natural history institutions have come together to build and support a part of biodiversity informatics in an open, collaborative manner. The system will facilitate open access to the data from a web browser, which will enhance the value of the collections and also conserve curatorial resources. The design paradigm can be extended and modified by other groups interested in other species sets. The networked information system will permit the participating institutions to support the global use of collection data in research, education, and informed decision making. This factual information about the earth's biodiversity will be readily available to help maintain and wisely manage the earth's natural resources. The distributed database for mammal collections will represent the first time that many of these data are available online, together. The simplicity of the design will provide a low-cost opportunity for any institution to participate.</AbstractNarration>
