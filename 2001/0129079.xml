    <AbstractNarration>0129079&lt;br/&gt;Morris&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This three-year award for US-France collaboration in chemical and transport systems involves researchers and students at Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Florida, University of Marseilles, and the Ecole Polytechnique. The US investigators, Jeffrey F. Morris and Jason E. Butler, and the French investigators, Elisabeth Guazzelli and Paul Manneville, will collaborate on theoretical and experimental studies of fluid transport and suspension of solid particles in pipes (tubes). The suspension mechanical perspective - in which particles impact the flow processes - and the role of inertia will be studied. Particle fraction and velocity distributions in pipes, flow structures and stability, bulk stresses in particle-laden liquids are emphasized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The collaboration merges experimental and theoretical expertise of the US and French research teams. Both types of expertise reside in the US and French groups. Jeffrey Morris is known for his quantitative theories. This is complemented by the French investigator's experimental expertise. The collaboration provides access to some unique French experimental facilities equipped with a functioning experimental loop for pipe flow suspensions. This collaboration advances understanding of engineering problems related to particulate transport. These problems are important in numerous industrial and geotechnical areas and processes, including fluvial and oceanic sediment transport and deposition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award represents the US side of parallel proposals to the NSF and the CNRS. NSF will cover travel funds and living expenses for the US investigator and students. The CNRS will support visits by French researchers and students to the United States.</AbstractNarration>
