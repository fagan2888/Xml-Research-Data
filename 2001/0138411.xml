    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0138411&lt;br/&gt;Rida T. Farouki&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though motivated by practical engineering considerations, &lt;br/&gt;surface intersection problems have deep roots in diverse &lt;br/&gt;areas of mathematics, including algebra, geometry, topology, &lt;br/&gt;analysis, and numerical methods. The proposed project will &lt;br/&gt;bring the diverse expertise and renewed commitment of an inter-disciplinary team of mathematicians, computer&lt;br/&gt;scientists, and engineers to bear on this critical problem. &lt;br/&gt;Since successful solutions will require radically new &lt;br/&gt;approaches and paradigms, rather than incremental advances, &lt;br/&gt;special emphasis will be placed on re-visiting the problem &lt;br/&gt;from first principles, seeking new insights through &lt;br/&gt;synergistic dialog among participants with diverse areas of&lt;br/&gt;expertise, and use of exploratory software implementations &lt;br/&gt;as research tools. A central theme of the proposed research &lt;br/&gt;is the ab initio incorporation of topological information &lt;br/&gt;into the formulation and verification of intersection algorithms. Although failure to guarantee topological consistency is &lt;br/&gt;the main deficiency of existing algorithms, this remains a &lt;br/&gt;poorly explored domain. Our initial line of enquiry will&lt;br/&gt;focus on using the homotopy or "embedding" method to track &lt;br/&gt;topological changes in implicitly-defined algebraic curves, &lt;br/&gt;as they evolve from "simple" initial configurations into a &lt;br/&gt;prescribed intersection locus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The accuracy, efficiency, and reliability of modern &lt;br/&gt;computer-aided design (CAD) systems has been severely &lt;br/&gt;compromised by the persistent lack of rigorous algorithms &lt;br/&gt;for topologically-consistent representations of surface &lt;br/&gt;intersections and trimmed surfaces. The solution to this&lt;br/&gt;fundamental problem can have tremendous economic impact, &lt;br/&gt;in terms of eliminating the laborious "geometry preparation &lt;br/&gt;and repair" task that currently precedes the use of CAD &lt;br/&gt;data in analysis, manufacturing, and inspection applications, &lt;br/&gt;and in resolving data-exchange incompatibilities among &lt;br/&gt;different CAD systems. The ensuing productivity benefits, &lt;br/&gt;manifested in accelerated design cycles and greater reliance &lt;br/&gt;on "virtual prototyping" for design verification, are crucial &lt;br/&gt;to the maintenance of technological leadership.</AbstractNarration>
