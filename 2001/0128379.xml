    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project concerns R&amp;D aimed at assessing the feasibility of applying statistical Machine Translation (MT) techniques to the problem of improving the productivity of human translators. Currently, human translators use translation memory tools, i.e., software packages that provide access to databases of previously translated sentences. Unfortunately, these tools do not provide significant help in translating previously unseen sentences and do not improve over time (with the exception of providing access to increasingly larger databases of previously translated material). Because automatic translation systems produce low quality translations that are not tailored to their genre and domain of interest, human translators refuse to use automatic translation systems. In this program, a prototype hybrid translation system and computer interface that will permit humans to translate text by exploiting both a translation memory and an automatic, statistical-based MT system will be built and &lt;br/&gt;the increase in text translation productivity that is enabled by the use of the hybrid tool will be measured.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A hybrid translation tool such as that proposed here has the potential to reduce significantly the costs associated with human translation, and increase translation productivity.</AbstractNarration>
