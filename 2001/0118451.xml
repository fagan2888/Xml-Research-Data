    <AbstractNarration>This award provides continued support of the Foundation's long-term commitment for the American National Election Studies (ANES) as a major data gathering and archiving resource. The major purpose of ANES is to sustain and enhance the diversified database that supports basic research on voting, public opinion, and political participation in the United States. The importance of the project derives from the significance of these topics. Voting, public opinion, and participation are essential elements in the grand and complex story of politics and citizenship. Over the last twenty-five years, ANES has successfully provided the empirical and conceptual foundations for research that has deepened an understanding of the part that Americans play in this process. Thousands of scholars have used the ANES database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves a continuation of the American National Election Studies. The investigators carry out a 2004 study of a national probability sample of 1200 individuals interviewed in the pre-presidential election period. Approximately eighty five percent of those respondents are re-interviewed in the post-election period. Both interviews last 50 minutes each on average and all are carried out face-to-face. All data are made available quickly via a Web site and via the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. A Board of Overseers, consisting of outstanding scholars from the electoral research community, advises the principal investigators and serves as representatives of the larger community of users of the ANES data. There are opportunities for the diverse national social science community to participate directly in the design and execution of ANES studies. There are resources for improving the quality of the core ANES time-series data and for testing innovations in theory, measurement, and data collection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research constitutes the most important database for the study of American politics and American political behavior.</AbstractNarration>
