    <AbstractNarration>Intrusion detection is a critical component of the defense-in-depth&lt;br/&gt;network security mechanisms. Current intrusion detection systems&lt;br/&gt;(IDSs) are ineffective against new and sophisticated attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key objective of this research project is to develop the&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, tools, and system architecture for adaptive IDSs. An&lt;br/&gt;adaptive IDS needs to detect new attacks and adjust to changes in&lt;br/&gt;normal operations. Towards this end, an information-theoretic based&lt;br/&gt;anomaly detection framework is investigated. The approach is to first&lt;br/&gt;compute the regularity of normal data using information-theoretic&lt;br/&gt;measures, then select features and construct a detection model&lt;br/&gt;according to the regularity measures. An adaptive IDS needs to also&lt;br/&gt;self-monitor its run-time workload and performance, and dynamically&lt;br/&gt;reconfigure its components to provide the best detection capability&lt;br/&gt;given the limited resources. Towards this end, performance monitoring,&lt;br/&gt;load-shedding, attack scenario analysis, and cost-benefit analysis&lt;br/&gt;techniques are investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the publications and algorithms and tools from this research,&lt;br/&gt;researchers and practitioners can learn the benefits and techniques of&lt;br/&gt;adaptive IDSs. This research also makes important contributions to&lt;br/&gt;related fields, e.g., survivable network systems and smart&lt;br/&gt;auditing. Ultimately, the society will benefit from the more effective&lt;br/&gt;and robust security mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>
