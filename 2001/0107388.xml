    <AbstractNarration>Mogilner&lt;br/&gt;0107388&lt;br/&gt; Mathematical and theoretical biology is a vital and rapidly&lt;br/&gt;growing subject that complements empirical work and provides&lt;br/&gt;model systems for study and manipulation. Such model systems can&lt;br/&gt;sometime suggest shortcuts when the experimetal work is&lt;br/&gt;difficult. More often, the models provide novel tools to disect&lt;br/&gt;complex biological phenomena in addition to traditional&lt;br/&gt;techniques. The current challenge in the field is to make&lt;br/&gt;quantitative modeling, on the one hand, a part of the process of&lt;br/&gt;fundamental biological discovery, and, on the other hand,&lt;br/&gt;applicable in biomedical and biotechnological situations. This&lt;br/&gt;requires researchers with biological skills and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;insight and facility. At this time such individuals are rare.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator and his colleagues organize an International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Mathematical and Theoretical Biology at Hilo,&lt;br/&gt;Hawaii on July 15--19, 2001. The goals of the meeting are to&lt;br/&gt;highlight current top-level research, to provide a perspective on&lt;br/&gt;future research areas, to provide opportunities for career&lt;br/&gt;development to junior researchers and underrepresented categories&lt;br/&gt;of researchers, to foster interactions between established&lt;br/&gt;researchers and junior researchers and between theorists and&lt;br/&gt;experimentalists. The meeting highlights exciting traditional&lt;br/&gt;and new areas of rapid growth in mathematical biology, such as&lt;br/&gt;theoretical ecology and evolution, quantitative cell biology,&lt;br/&gt;proteomics, mathematical modeling in medicine and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;physiology and immunology. Plenary speakers both give a broad&lt;br/&gt;overview of their field and focus on areas for future research.&lt;br/&gt;Additional contributed and poster sessions are organized to give&lt;br/&gt;junior researchers the chance to be heard.&lt;br/&gt; Mathematical and theoretical biology is a young&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary field of science that provides quantitative&lt;br/&gt;models in biology. These models provide novel tools to disect&lt;br/&gt;complex biological phenomena. The current challenge in the field&lt;br/&gt;is to train researchers with biological skills and mathematical&lt;br/&gt;insight and facility. The conference helps to highlight current&lt;br/&gt;top-level research and provides opportunities for career&lt;br/&gt;development to junior researchers and underrepresented categories&lt;br/&gt;of researchers.</AbstractNarration>
