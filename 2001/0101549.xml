    <AbstractNarration>To date, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has certified aircraft technicians under its Federal Aviation Regulations. These regulations dictate curriculum and testing procedures for schools that prepare Airframe (aircraft structure) and Powerplant (engines) Technicians. Advancements in aircraft systems, structures and engines without regulatory updates and the current shortage of technicians, demand aggressive measures to improve and expand the current system of preparing aircraft technicians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is serving as a catalyst for systemic change in the preparation of aircraft technicians by bringing together many organizations that have the capacity to influence change on a national basis. As a major step to involve partners, the project is organizing a national conference whose focus is to develop a plan for aircraft technician reform, addressing the basic mathematics and science requirements as well as the specific skills and curriculum for avionics, airframe, and other related aviation specialties. In particular, the topics to be considered include certification standards and procedures, curricula including both core and technical courses, internship programs, access to instructional technology, student recruitment, and faculty development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A second goal of this project is the development and testing of three courses -- electrical connectors, communication, and navigation. The initial testing of these courses is with incumbent technicians. After the initial trouble shooting, the courses are being introduced as credit courses setting the foundation for new aircraft electronics certification programs.</AbstractNarration>
