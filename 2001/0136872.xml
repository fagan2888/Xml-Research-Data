    <AbstractNarration>Seismologists have predicted that a severe earthquake in the&lt;br/&gt;Istanbul region is highly likely in the next 30 years. This&lt;br/&gt;forecast has drawn much attention in the media and raises&lt;br/&gt;challenges as to how potential losses may be reduced by&lt;br/&gt;protective measures. Decisions made by private individuals,&lt;br/&gt;by officials, and by engineers and builders are all relevant&lt;br/&gt;to this question. The principles underlying protective decision&lt;br/&gt;making need to be better understood, for the sake of this and&lt;br/&gt;many other applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We investigate how people determine whether to purchase insurance&lt;br/&gt;and/or invest in loss-reduction measures against risks from fire, theft,&lt;br/&gt;accidents or natural disasters. We examine the effects of different&lt;br/&gt;ways in which risks can be communicated and different frames in which&lt;br/&gt;information and choices can be presented; we also examine how&lt;br/&gt;protective decisions are affected by instructional modules that aid&lt;br/&gt;understanding of probability and that suggest useful general strategies&lt;br/&gt;for framing decisions. To estimate these effects, controlled laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiments, field surveys and interviews will be conducted both in&lt;br/&gt;the United States and in Turkey.</AbstractNarration>
