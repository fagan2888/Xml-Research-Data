    <AbstractNarration>This Focused Research Group is composed of pure&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, computational mathematicians, and&lt;br/&gt;neuroscientists. They develop implementations of discrete&lt;br/&gt;conformal mapping for multidisciplinary use, both within&lt;br/&gt;mathematics itself where complex analysis is being reinvigorated&lt;br/&gt;by new discrete techniques, and in the larger scientific context&lt;br/&gt;with visualization and analysis of scientific data. The Riemann&lt;br/&gt;Mapping Theorem guarantees unique conformal maps between any pair&lt;br/&gt;of conformal 2-discs (or conformal 2-spheres); the conformal&lt;br/&gt;geometry preserved by such maps carries valuable mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structure. Such surfaces arise naturally in many scientific&lt;br/&gt;contexts as piecewise flat (from data) or smoothly embedded (from&lt;br/&gt;theory) surfaces in 3-space. Recently the new computational&lt;br/&gt;technique of circle packing has allowed computational&lt;br/&gt;approximations to these conformal maps. Implementing such&lt;br/&gt;approximations for large scientific datasets faces both&lt;br/&gt;theoretical and computational challenges. The investigator and&lt;br/&gt;his colleagues work on three related topics: theoretical&lt;br/&gt;superstructure of the circle packing technique, refinement and&lt;br/&gt;parallelization of the circle packing algorithm for use on large&lt;br/&gt;datasets, and the application of these conformal maps to&lt;br/&gt;visualization and analysis of scientific data. The main&lt;br/&gt;application focuses on conformal flattening of human brain&lt;br/&gt;cortical surfaces. The investigators use uniqueness of conformal&lt;br/&gt;maps to install surface-based coordinate systems on these&lt;br/&gt;surfaces; these coordinate systems allow localization of&lt;br/&gt;activation foci in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and&lt;br/&gt;functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) brain scans.&lt;br/&gt;Conformal flattening has wider applicability as a visualization&lt;br/&gt;and graph embedding technique, and these connections inform the&lt;br/&gt;research.&lt;br/&gt; This Focused Research Group develops algorithms to bring a&lt;br/&gt;classical mathematics theorem (the Riemann Mapping Theorem, 1854)&lt;br/&gt;to bear on problems of visualization of data. The Riemann Mapping&lt;br/&gt;Theorem guarantees the existence of unique conformal&lt;br/&gt;(angle-preserving) maps between surfaces, but does say how to&lt;br/&gt;compute these maps. Modern computers and new algorithms have&lt;br/&gt;changed all that, because our new computational ability can&lt;br/&gt;breathe life into classical existence theorems of mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;turning theory into computational tools. This project develops&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to implement the computation of conformal maps on&lt;br/&gt;complex spatial surfaces. The main application is the flat&lt;br/&gt;mapping of human brain cortical surfaces. The brain surface is&lt;br/&gt;highly convoluted and folded in space, and most of the brain&lt;br/&gt;surface is folded up and hidden from view. If one flattens the&lt;br/&gt;surface, one can simultaneously see down into all the folds. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematically unique conformal maps produced by the algorithms&lt;br/&gt;allow surface-based coordinate systems to be computed on the&lt;br/&gt;brain surface so that surface positions can be precisely&lt;br/&gt;determined. Moreover, if one puts foci of functional activation&lt;br/&gt;onto the flattened surface, one can then visualize and measure&lt;br/&gt;the relationship between brain function and brain anatomy. These&lt;br/&gt;new surface-mapping techniques and their application to the brain&lt;br/&gt;surface permit biomedical researchers and clinicians to rapidly&lt;br/&gt;and accurately map and compare the locations of physiological and&lt;br/&gt;pathological "events" in the brains of research subjects and of&lt;br/&gt;patients with a variety of neurological and psychiatric&lt;br/&gt;disorders. The project is supported by the Computational&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Geometric Analysis programs&lt;br/&gt;and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in MPS and by the&lt;br/&gt;Computational Neuroscience program in BIO.</AbstractNarration>
