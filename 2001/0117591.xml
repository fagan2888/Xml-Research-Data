    <AbstractNarration>The Summer School for Chemical Engineering faculty is organized by the Chemical Engineering Division of the American Society for Engineering Education and is currently held every five years. The 2002 Summer School will be the thirteenth in the series begun in 1931 and will be held on the campus of the University of Colorado in Boulder from July 27 through August 2. This Summer School is unique amongst the various engineering disciplines as it strives to promote development of primarily new faculty with the assistance of established faculty, representatives from governmental agencies such as NSF and EPA, and industrial participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main purpose of the Summer School for Chemical Engineering Faculty is to disseminate innovative and effective teaching methods to a wide spectrum of primarily new chemical engineering faculty who will be teaching courses and laboratories in undergraduate programs. Additionally, the Summer School will introduce new faculty to a number of promising research areas from which concepts, principles, problems, and laboratory experiments can be incorporated into undergraduate course work. The Summer School also brings new faculty together with mid- career and senior faculty to discuss educational methods and educational delivery and to provide tested educational materials directly to new faculty for use in a variety of courses. Workshops are planned in many areas that receive NSF and EPA research support, including molecular modeling, nanoparticle technology, bioengineering, green chemical engineering, and effective use of computers and educational technology. The educational techniques and extensive course and laboratory materials produced will be distributed widely via CD-ROMs and the Internet to the entire chemical engineering educational community. It is the objective of the upcoming Summer School to have an impact on every single B.S. graduate in chemical engineering as early as the spring of 2003, as well as all those graduates who will follow.</AbstractNarration>
