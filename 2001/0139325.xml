    <AbstractNarration>The program aims to help improve articulation between high school mathematics and science courses and between middle and high school science courses. It capitalizes on existing programs and partnerships between the schools and Boston University and the technology already present but underutilized in the schools. The fellow-teacher teams are combining virtual models and existing software (such as Biologica or MathSoft Study Works) with hands on data collection to enhance student understanding of concepts in the state science standards. The Fellows' understanding of classroom practice is enhanced through participation in a teacher enhancement summer workshop that precedes their work with their teacher team members and their classroom experience, and participation during the year in a GK-12 seminar series and specifically designed education courses. The project includes work with Fellow faculty advisors to help them understand the potential benefits to their students and specific efforts by the evaluation team to explore ways to ensure sustainability of the project. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences</AbstractNarration>
