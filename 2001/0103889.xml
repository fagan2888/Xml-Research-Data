    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0103889&lt;br/&gt;William M. Goldman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project continues the PI's investigation of locally &lt;br/&gt;homogeneous geometric structures on manifolds, their moduli &lt;br/&gt;spaces and their symmetries. The holonomy correspondence &lt;br/&gt;relates moduli of geometric structures to the representation &lt;br/&gt;theory of the fundamental group. The primary geometric &lt;br/&gt;structures of this investigation include conformally flat &lt;br/&gt;Lorentz and Riemannian structures, real projective and affine structures, and real and complex hyperbolic structures. &lt;br/&gt;Dynamical questions concerning both the action of the &lt;br/&gt;fundamental group, various flows (including and generalizing&lt;br/&gt;the geodesic, horocycle and frame flows) and the automorphisms &lt;br/&gt;of the moduli space will be studied. The close interaction &lt;br/&gt;between the dynamics of the mapping class group and the &lt;br/&gt;global topology of the moduli space is especially notable. &lt;br/&gt;The moduli spaces often possess symplectic structures which &lt;br/&gt;lead to important and mysterious algebraic constructions, &lt;br/&gt;such as the Lie algebra based on curves in a smooth surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objects play an increasingly important role both &lt;br/&gt;in mathematics and physics. Lorentzian manifolds arise as &lt;br/&gt;cosmological models in relativity. Moduli spaces have become &lt;br/&gt;central in quantum physics, and mapping class group actions &lt;br/&gt;and Teichmuller space have become prominent in 2-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;quantum gravity. This study lies in the interface between geometry/topology, dynamical systems, analysis and algebra. &lt;br/&gt;Despite their complicated nature, the examples studied are&lt;br/&gt;extremely explicit. Thus one can profitably investigate &lt;br/&gt;them experimentally. Our current computer technology is &lt;br/&gt;appropriate for such projects. With Dr. Richard Schwartz &lt;br/&gt;and the support of the University of Maryland Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;Department, the Experimental Geometry Lab has been operating &lt;br/&gt;for over a year. This lab has included software projects &lt;br/&gt;performed by postgraduates, graduate students, and especially undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>
