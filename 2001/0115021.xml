    <AbstractNarration>0115021&lt;br/&gt;Gulseren&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project is to support a cooperative research project by Dr. Oguz Gulseren, Materials Science and Engineering Department, Dr. John Fischer, Physics Department, both at the University of Pennsylvania, and Dr. Selim Ciraci, Department of Physics, Bilkent University, Ankara, Turkey. They plan to use advanced techniques to study the electronic and structural properties of carbon nanotubes and their functionalized derivatives. In particular they will investigate the phase behavior of the carbon nanotubes under external pressure and strain, and their interactions with hydrogen and various transition metals. The work will involve first principles calculations by groups from the Universities of Pennsylvania and Bilkent, as well as neutron scattering measurements performed by scientists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: Nanoscience is an emerging field with promising important applications. The results to be obtained from this project should help guide other activities focused on novel technological applications such as nanodevices and hydrogen storage etc. The scientific methods to be used by the University of Pennsylvania and by Bilkent University are complementary in terms of material synthesis, measurement capabilities, and theoretical expertise. The American PIs have excellent track records in NSF-supported research in carbon nanotubes. Dr. Ciraci has participated in a previous NSF international program that had good results in terms of scientific progress and publications. The collaboration between American and Turkish groups will result in synergistic enhancements of the research. This project meets INT criteria for supporting meritorious collaborative research of mutual benefit to the US and the foreign country.</AbstractNarration>
