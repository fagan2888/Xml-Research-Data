    <AbstractNarration>The major objective of the ten week Summer Undergraduate Research Focus (SURF)-Anthropogenic Impacts on the Environment program is to provide research experiences and education for ten undergraduate students, particularly female and minority students. Recruitment efforts focus on students who are not likely to have research opportunities at their home institutions, for example students at community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;The common focus of the research activities is an investigation of the effects of human activities on the environment, particularly the coastal environment. Research projects will be mentored by faculty members of the Department of Physical &amp; Life Science Department at Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi. The research opportunities reflect the interdisciplinary nature of this department. Hands-on laboratory and field experiences will be provided by faculty members representing the disciplines of biology, chemistry, environmental science, geosciences, and mariculture. The goals of the program are to improve the critical thinking ability and communication skills of the students, and to prepare them for a professional career in the sciences. The intended impact is to provide hands-on science experiences to foster life-long science learning and to increase the number of minority students pursuing advanced degrees in science.&lt;br/&gt;Following an initial one-week orientation, the standard weekly schedule includes four days of laboratory/field research, a half day excursion and another half day of group meetings. The group meetings include a debriefing session to assess and address student progress, problems and concerns; a journal club; professional skills activities; and an ethics in science component.&lt;br/&gt;SURF will conclude with a symposium in which the students deliver oral or poster presentations of their research. In addition to the ten-week summer program, students are funded to present their research at one regional or national conference during the regular academic year.</AbstractNarration>
