    <AbstractNarration>A major trend in distributed computing is toward environments consisting of numerous wearable, handheld and embedded devices. Rapid growth in inexpensive, short range, and low-power wireless communications and hardware, are now enabling experimentation with ubiquitous computing environments. In order for ubiquitous environments to work well, it is essential that devices be able to detect their current context, that they must be aware of relationships between the users and the devices, and handle ad-hoc groups and their communications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal plans to take an integrated hardware and software approach to developing essential services to support a wide variety of distributed applications in heterogeneous environments. The services include investigation of:&lt;br/&gt;situation-aware inter-object communications&lt;br/&gt;group management service to establish device communities&lt;br/&gt;feasibility of using cellular automata computational model to design a scalable dissemination service&lt;br/&gt;a service that will use the concept of context-sensitivity to perform trade-offs between transparent and QoS assisted adaptations.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will develop a Reconfigurable and Context-Sensitive Middleware, which will be open-source, open-schematic and open standard middleware based on top of Bluetooth standards.</AbstractNarration>
