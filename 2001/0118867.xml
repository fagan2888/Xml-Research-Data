    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OCE-0118867&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New production is that component of total phytoplankton production fueled by nitrate uptake and the fixation of N2. In a nitrogen-limited model of ocean plankton growth, new production can be used to define an upper limit for the export of organic material from the surface to deeper layers. Thus, new production is an important starting point to determine the ocean's role in the vertical flux of bio-active materials such as carbon dioxide. A second critical factor is the amount of new production that is exported to depth. Both export and new production can vary independently and both need to be understood to predict how efficiently material will be removed from surface waters. Previous time series measurements in the Cariaco Basin off northeast Venezuela recorded prodigious productivity associated with the winter upwelling period and lower (although still moderate) production in summer as well as the possible contribution of chemosynthesis at depth to the total organic export. Thus, the region is a useful example of a low-latitude eutrophic-ocean margin region in which much of the production reaches deep water. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, researchers from the Lamont-Dougherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University will study the relative contribution of nitrate uptake and N2 fixation to total particulate export and how these sources vary seasonally in the Cariaco Basin. The proposed work is a companion effort with the ongoing CARIACO Time-Series Project. While the latter core effort will provide the basic logistics, physical and chemical and productivity measurements, the work undertaken in this project will focus on the source, amount and export efficiency of new production. Direct incubation methods will be used to measure the seasonal changes in nitrate uptake and N2 fixation in surface waters using both 15 N tracer techniques for nitrate and di-nitrogen gas as well as the acetylene reduction for N2 fixation. Seasonal sampling of these rates over two years will provide a basis for estimating the relative importance of N2 fixation, a potentially important input of combined nitrogen to the ocean. In addition to sediment trap comparisons, the overall efficiency of export also will be measured with a recently developed 13C dilution method for estimating sub-surface carbon respiration. Finally, these rate measurements will be used to calibrate a model of new production and export in the region based on remotely sensed information. The model will explicitly estimate N2 fixation. This work will help to constrain the cumulative role of tropical margins in the supply of combined nitrogen to the ocean as well as in total-ocean carbon uptake.</AbstractNarration>
