    <AbstractNarration>Reed&lt;br/&gt;0109872&lt;br/&gt; Certain cells in the mammalian auditory brainstem (three&lt;br/&gt;neurons from the periphery) show exceptionally small standard&lt;br/&gt;deviations in the microsecond range of the timing of the first&lt;br/&gt;action potential response under repeated trials of the same&lt;br/&gt;sound. Moreover, the latency and its standard deviation are&lt;br/&gt;quite independent of frequency and decibel level over large&lt;br/&gt;ranges. This behavior is exceptional since the inputs to these&lt;br/&gt;cells come from octopus and other cells in the contralateral&lt;br/&gt;cochlear nucleus, a nucleus which is ennervated by auditory nerve&lt;br/&gt;fibers that have much larger standard deviations and high&lt;br/&gt;dependence on frequency and decibel level. Thus, this system is&lt;br/&gt;an example of how the brain can use relatively sloppy and&lt;br/&gt;variable devices (neurons) to perform surprisingly accurate&lt;br/&gt;calculations. Professor Michael Reed, with colleague physiologist&lt;br/&gt;Joseph Blum, investigates this system with three research&lt;br/&gt;projects: (i) They create and investigate by machine computation&lt;br/&gt;a large scale mathematical model of the whole system using known&lt;br/&gt;physiological properties of auditory nerve fibers and recently&lt;br/&gt;discovered properties of octopus cells; (ii) They use&lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis investigate of the improvement of the&lt;br/&gt;standard deviation of latency in converging networks where the&lt;br/&gt;target cells require coincident inputs within time windows in&lt;br/&gt;order to fire; (iii) They use partial differential equations to&lt;br/&gt;understand the special properties of dendritic information&lt;br/&gt;processing in octopus cells.&lt;br/&gt; Using mathematics and machine computation, Professor Michael&lt;br/&gt;Reed continues to study how groups of cells (neurons) in the&lt;br/&gt;auditory brainstem perform calculations that individual cells can&lt;br/&gt;not do by themselves. Neurons are inherently sloppy and variable&lt;br/&gt;devices that perform differently even under (apparently) the same&lt;br/&gt;conditions with the same inputs. Nevertheless, large groups of&lt;br/&gt;these neurons are able to perform together, reliably, highly&lt;br/&gt;accurate calculations. This project tries to understand this&lt;br/&gt;apparent paradox. The project sheds light on how and why human&lt;br/&gt;brains are organized the way they are and it suggests new&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms for the development of man-made thinking devices.</AbstractNarration>
