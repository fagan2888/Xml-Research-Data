    <AbstractNarration>0140179&lt;br/&gt;Hubler &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One aspect of biocomplexity is the ability of biota to self-adjust to their&lt;br/&gt;environment. Previous studies of adaptive behavior have shown that&lt;br/&gt;adaptive systems will evolve over time to states that are weakly chaotic, a&lt;br/&gt;condition known as the edge of chaos. These studies typically use a&lt;br/&gt;genetic algorithm (computer-based evolution) to implement adaptation. It&lt;br/&gt;is conjectured that most self-adjusting dynamical systems that initially&lt;br/&gt;have chaotic behavior will also adapt toward the edge of chaos. A model&lt;br/&gt;for self-adjusting dynamical systems is introduced which treats the control&lt;br/&gt;parameters as slowly varying, rather than constant. The dynamics of these&lt;br/&gt;parameters is assumed to be governed by some low-pass filtered feedback&lt;br/&gt;from the dynamical variables of the system. Under the influence of noise,&lt;br/&gt;at least in numerical models, the probability of chaotic breakout shows a&lt;br/&gt;universal scaling with the duration of the breakouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Applications of the model to biochemical oscillators as the simplest&lt;br/&gt;possible adaptive system relevent to environmental dynamics will be&lt;br/&gt;investigated. A high degree of interdisciplinarity is required, as the&lt;br/&gt;research involves expertise in dynamical systems, plant biology,&lt;br/&gt;instrumental measurements, cybernetics, enzymology, chemistry, and physics.&lt;br/&gt; The system is chosen to be "biocomplex," yet simple enough that meaningful&lt;br/&gt;measurements can be made and quantitative models can be evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We intend to experimentally demonstrate adaptation using the&lt;br/&gt;peroxidase-oxidase oscillator as an example. This system is known to&lt;br/&gt;exhibit non-linear, complex, and even chaotic behavior. We will explore if&lt;br/&gt;the in situ behavior of this enzyme provides the first experimental&lt;br/&gt;evidence for adaptation to the edge of chaos in a naturally occurring&lt;br/&gt;system. Detailed chemical models are available to guide our experiments.&lt;br/&gt;We will experimentally implement low-pass filtered feedback from the&lt;br/&gt;dynamical variables to the control parameters through:&lt;br/&gt;1. a computer based probe-actuator system, and &lt;br/&gt;2. the comparatively slow response of the metabolism of a thin section&lt;br/&gt; of horseradish root tissues suspended in a reactor, and check for&lt;br/&gt; adaptation to the edge of chaos, and critical scaling of chaotic&lt;br/&gt; outbreaks of chemical oscillations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach activities to local secondary schools will be incorporated into&lt;br/&gt;our existing collaborations with high school science teachers. If our&lt;br/&gt;initial experiments on plant peroxidases show the anticipated complexity,&lt;br/&gt;we will then explore the related complexity in the behavior of peroxidases&lt;br/&gt;and oxidases in human neutrophils, cells associated with anti-bacterial&lt;br/&gt;activity and response to systemic afronts.</AbstractNarration>
