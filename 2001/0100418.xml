    <AbstractNarration>Professor Xia proposes to continue his investigation of dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonian systems. One of the most important problems in Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems is whether orbits in typical systems are stable. The&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will address these problems, with research topics such as&lt;br/&gt;Aubry-Mather theory, Arnold diffusions, chaotic behaviors and Newtonian&lt;br/&gt;$n$-body problem. The ultimate goal is to show that typical near integrable&lt;br/&gt;Hamiltonians in higher dimensions are topologically unstable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research concerns the stability problems in Hamiltonian&lt;br/&gt;dyanmics. Hamiltonian dynamical systems model many systems arising&lt;br/&gt;from classical mechanics, celestial mechanics and physics. These&lt;br/&gt;problems has a long history, going back to Poincare and Birkhoff. A&lt;br/&gt;typical question one often asks is the following: Is our solar system&lt;br/&gt;stable? One of our goals is to find an answer to this and a large&lt;br/&gt;class of related questions. With recent progresses in the theory of&lt;br/&gt;modern dynamical systems, we understand much better the chaotic nature&lt;br/&gt;of typical systems. However, the stability problem remains open except&lt;br/&gt;in some special cases and it is one of the most important areas of&lt;br/&gt;study, from both theoretical point of view and wide applications it&lt;br/&gt;finds in various physical systems.</AbstractNarration>
