    <AbstractNarration>The Amphibians and Reptiles and Their Parasites of Mexico-A Megadiverse Country&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will inventory the diversity of amphibians and reptiles of Mexico, the country with the largest numbers of species of these two classes of vertebrates. In addition to the large number of species, Mexico is of particular biogeographical interest because it includes the transition zone between the two great faunal regions of the Western Hemisphere, the Neartic and Neotropical. An analysis of previous collecting localities revealed a large geographical collecting bias. The rugged relief of Mexico has made access into many highland areas difficult, and this is reflected in the small number of collections made in mountainous regions above 1500 meters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As specimens of amphibians and reptiles are collected, the parasites living on them also will be collected and preserved for taxonomic identification. Based on previous information, it is anticipated that parasites from at least seven different invertebrate phyla will be collected and identified. The amphibians and reptiles and their parasites (protozoans and metazoans, internal and external) will be surveyed over a three-year period, emphasizing the most poorly known mountainous regions. These regions have been selected because they are the most poorly known, and in several of them the forests are rapidly disappearing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 1100 described species of amphibians and reptiles are known from Mexico, and 62% of these species are known only from Mexico. Approximately one hundred new species of amphibians and reptiles have been described from Mexico since 1980 even without an organized survey for the country. It is anticipated that 200+ species of amphibians and reptiles, and a far larger number of parasites, remain to be discovered in Mexico. In addition to describing new taxa, a web-accessible geo-referenced database for Mexican amphibians and reptiles will be developed, and checklists, distribution maps, and identification keys will be prepared. The materials collected during this survey will be available to researchers in systematics, ecology, and conservation. Graduate students from Mexico and the U.S., and Mexican scientists will participate in all aspects of the project.</AbstractNarration>
