    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Mechanical (56)&lt;br/&gt;The importance of developing learning communities, where students interact with those outside their class, has recently been emphasized by NSF-DUE initiatives, which encourage interaction between high schools, community colleges and universities. The proposed project is designed to develop a learning community in a freshman engineering design course. The design course is being adopted from an established design curriculum, which emphasizes hands-on learning. Enhanced teamwork/communication components is being added by coordinating with a high school technology program, and a freshman engineering graphics course. Curriculums from all three courses are being coordinated, creating a learning community. Students from each course are participating in the design process at different levels. The primary design responsibility remains with the design class, however, design teams include students and facilities from the other courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objectives of the coordinated curriculum are to: &lt;br/&gt;1. Develop communication skills necessary for meaningful technical interaction between colleagues with diverse educational backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;2. Develop students' awareness that material taught in one course is related and applied in other courses.&lt;br/&gt;3. Develop communication and research skills within the design process early in students' careers.&lt;br/&gt;4. Encourage high school students to pursue careers in science or engineering by engaging them in the design process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An implementation of a unique short-term assessment process enables quick curricular changes in response to student needs. The project had generated much interest with local community colleges. Dissemination involves presentations at the regional meeting of universities and colleges, and local workshops.</AbstractNarration>
