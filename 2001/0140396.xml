    <AbstractNarration>Since 1976, plastics have been the most widely used materials in the U.S., surpassing steel, copper and aluminum combined by volume. Among the various plastics processing methods, injection molding accounts for one-third of all polymers processed. This research is aimed at developing the scientific basis for a novel co-injection molding process that combines the aesthetic and processing advantages of injection molding with the property attributes and benefits of microcellular plastics (MCPs). By integrating solid plastics with MCPs via co-injection molding, synergistic benefits, such as increased productivity, reduced energy consumption, additional design freedom in part geometry, and a means to control the microstructure and properties of the molded products, can be realized. Furthermore, this environmentally benign process is a perfect candidate for recycling of post-consumer plastics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research involves systematic analytical, experimental, and computational efforts to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of this novel process, advance the understanding of the process physics, develop computer modeling and simulation tools, and incorporate the research activities/results into the curricula to stimulates students' interest in advanced research and education. Collaboration with industrial partners in this research facilitates the sharing of expertise and resources, validation of research outcome, transfer of technology, education of the workforce, and assessment of the economic gain. Successful execution of this research will extend the applicability of MCPs and injection molding, ultimately helping the U.S. plastics industry gain competitive strength in the global marketplace.</AbstractNarration>
