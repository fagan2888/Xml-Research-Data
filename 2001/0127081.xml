    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;One of the greatest challenges facing engineering education is to provide realistic and engaging learning experiences for undergraduates that properly reflect the concerns and needs of industry. Technology in the areas of product design and manufacturing is increasing at a rapid pace and education must keep up to produce engineers capable of contributing effectively to cost-driven projects with significantly reduced cycle times. This project adapts the integrated use of modern rapid prototyping and CNC machining equipment into the curricula of three engineering departments: mechanical, aerospace, and civil. Both technologies are being used in the design sequence of mechanical engineering, similar to their use at Purdue University and MIT. Students are able to quickly fabricate design concepts and working models, reinforcing the design sequence taught in class. Aerospace engineering students are using the equipment during a course sequence to design, build, and test student created aircraft. Where current methods of production are slow and out-dated, the proposed equipment provides individual learning experiences similar to those found in industry. Civil engineering students are using the equipment for stress analysis and enhanced visualization in the classroom. This project is providing a hands-on learning environment for students, and enabling the implementation of modern engineering practices in design and manufacturing to produce future leaders in industry. Assessment involves industrial advisory panels. Educational resources, quality assessment data and machine capabilities are being shared with local and national educators.</AbstractNarration>
