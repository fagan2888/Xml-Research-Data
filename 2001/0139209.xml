    <AbstractNarration>William Evans, University of California-Irvine, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for continuing studies of the special reduction chemistry of the lanthanide metals. Specifically, he is studying "sterically induced reduction", a recently discovered reaction observed with (C5Me5)3Sm, a very crowded molecule with unusually long metal-carbon distances. Evans hopes to extend this size-related reduction to other lanthanides, which do not usually participate in reductive chemistry. The second research area involves the chemistry of TmI2, DyI2, and NdI2, highly reducing compounds that have only recently been prepared. The reactions of these divalent lanthanides with nitrogen, small molecule oxides, and hydrocarbons will be studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique properties of the lanthanide metals offer opportunities to develop new types of reductive reactivity. Since reduction is one of the basic types of chemical reactions, this can broadly impact both synthetic and catalytic chemistry. In addition, through this research, students will be trained in the chemistry of the f-elements.</AbstractNarration>
