    <AbstractNarration>0107261&lt;br/&gt;Marino&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide 24 months of support to Dr. Stephen F. Marino to work with Professor Andreas Plueckthun at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is the generation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) amenable to structural studies. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that are primary receptors responsible for olfaction, vision, taste, hormonal and neuronal action. Between 1 and 3% of the vertebrate genome is thought to code for GPCR-like sequences and they are the primary targets of up to 50% of all pharmaceuticals. Structures of other GPCRs would allow the scientific community to understand how GPCRs can bind diverse ligands such as peptides, nucleotides, amino acids, lipids, ions, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Plueckthun lab has pioneered ribosome display applications, making it the best place to conduct this research.</AbstractNarration>
