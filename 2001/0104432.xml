    <AbstractNarration>Prop: AST-0104432&lt;br/&gt;PI: Johnson, Kelsey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Johnson is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research, education, and public outreach at the University of Wisconsin and at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Socorro. Her research program focuses on the study of the earliest stages of massive star clusters. She will use panchromatic data, from the radio to the near-infrared, to study the physical properties of the star clusters as they evolve from being completely enshrouded to being dominated by stellar light. Study of these clusters provides knowledge of the conditions required for the formation of massive star clusters and their physical properties at different stages in their development. Dr. Johnson will also carry out a program of undergraduate education, community outreach, and minority participation and recruitment. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
