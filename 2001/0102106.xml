    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Molecular characterization of microbial nitrite reductase genes from a permanently ice covered Antarctic lake." Lake Bonney is a permanently ice-covered, chemically-stratified Antarctic lake that is unusual in that denitrification occurs in the deep anoxic waters of the east but not the west lobe. The goal of this project is to compare the distribution, diversity, and expression of denitrification genes (nitrite reductase) from microorganisms in the two lobes in an attempt to explain this mystery.</AbstractNarration>
