    <AbstractNarration>Hannes Jonsson of the University of Washington is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop methods for calculating transition rates in materials in combination with a plane-wave-based density functional theory (DFT) description of the energetics. Methods for finding mechanisms and transmission rates, such as the dimer method, climbing image-nudged elastic band method, and optimal hyperplanar transition state theory, will be explored and implemented. Methodologies will be applied to study diffusion and growth in semiconductors, in particular the growth of silicon/germanium surface mounds that may be useful in opto-electronic applications. Simulations that combine DFT estimates of transmission rates and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of long time dynamics will be carried out to enable careful comparisons to new experimental data. This project will also begin developing techniques to calculate excited states in condensed matter. A many-body perturbation expansion that builds in corrections to the DFT mean field description will be tested on small molecules, and then applied to study optical properties and photoinduced catalysis on titanium dioxide surfaces. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first principles prediction of technologically important material properties is a longstanding goal. The combination of efficient theoretical chemistry techniques and implementation on computer clusters or parallel computers finally can bring this elusive goal within reach. The outcomes of this research are anticipated to contribute to new knowledge of quantum dots, which have technological promise for use as optical switches. As well, studies of titanium dioxide photocatalysis are expected to improve understanding of important applications for this material that include harmful microorganism destruction, cancer cell inactivation, and oil spill cleanup.</AbstractNarration>
