    <AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Bowers will conduct research on the ion mobilities of molecules, clusters, metal ions, peptides, oligonucleotides, and other biomolecules. Specifically, work will be done on the energetics and mechanism of solvation of salt crystals, as well as on the conformations of polypeptides/proteins and DNA/RNA oligonucleotides. The energetics associated with their folding, hydration and interaction with metal ions will be investigated. These systems will be studied in the gas phase in order to avoid complications due to a solvent effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research attacks fundamental problems on the mobilities of ions and biomolecules in the gas phase. The results of these studies will be correlated with theoretical modeling. Graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral research associates will participate in this research. They will receive training in one of the forefront areas of contemporary physical chemistry and be thus prepared for advanced studies, or employment in industry, academia, or government laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
