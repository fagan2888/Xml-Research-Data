    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a small, portable, low-power amperometric biosensor to detect phenol in wastewater. A renewable, robust biosensor integrated into a microfluidic system is proposed and will be designed to specifically detect phenol in aqueous solutions based on an enzyme-based biosensor. This method will allow analysis of phenol without significant dilution or reduction in the sensitivity of the detected species. The microfluidic biosensor will use sol-gel modified, screen printed microband electrodes which will enhance the sensitivity and limit of detection of the device compared to electrodes of conventional size. The device will also use a simple pump and valve system for both electrolyte and analyte introduction into the sensor and proven electrochemical instrumentation for phenol detection. The proposed sensor will be applicable to real time, on-site monitoring of phenol concentrations in wastewater.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in industries such as pulp and paper, petroleum refining and plastic resins that need a cost effective and robust device to detect phenol in wastewater.</AbstractNarration>
