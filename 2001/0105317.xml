    <AbstractNarration>0105317&lt;br/&gt;Bierly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For years studies by government and private groups have addressed the changing research climate in the U.S. and also the changing education environment at all levels, K-12 through post-graduate. Many of these studies have had a common theme, the need for a closer integration of research and education. New opportunities using this theme continue to exist for restructuring or redirecting programs in the Earth and Space Sciences. Here, Earth and space science is defined broadly to include atmospheric sciences, geochemistry, geology, geophysics, earth sciences, hydrology, oceanography, aeronomy and space physics, and other closely allied disciplines. One of the best ways to move toward integrating research and education is to have open discussions with the leaders of departments responsible for the research and associated education. These are the Heads and Chairs of the Earth and Space Science Departments. This award supports the annual meetings of the Heads and Chairs over the next three years.</AbstractNarration>
