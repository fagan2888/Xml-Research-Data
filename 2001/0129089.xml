    <AbstractNarration>Most natural infections contain multiple viruses, and this has&lt;br/&gt;important consequences for virus evolution. On the one hand, viruses&lt;br/&gt;can swap genes during co-infection, creating variability that allows&lt;br/&gt;rapid virus evolution. On the other hand, increased competition between&lt;br/&gt;viruses can occur during co-infection, slowing the rate of virus&lt;br/&gt;evolution. This suggests a compromise where viruses evolve to restrict&lt;br/&gt;the numbers that enter a cell (to decrease competition) without reducing&lt;br/&gt;the number to one (to achieve gene exchange). Given the widespread&lt;br/&gt;occurrence of virus co-infection, it is surprising that the costs and&lt;br/&gt;benefits of this phenomenon are virtually unexplored. The focus of this&lt;br/&gt;project is to address the question using viruses that infect bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;Laboratory experiments will examine the evolution of virus traits that&lt;br/&gt;control co-infection numbers, and molecular analyses will determine the&lt;br/&gt;genetic changes responsible.&lt;br/&gt; The results of this project can be applied to several systems&lt;br/&gt;because viruses are important disease agents in animals, plants, and&lt;br/&gt;bacteria. Because the life cycle of the project virus is similar to&lt;br/&gt;that of many human viruses (such as influenza and HIV), the project data&lt;br/&gt;should contribute greatly to a better understanding of the generalized&lt;br/&gt;role of virus co-infection in human illnesses.</AbstractNarration>
