    <AbstractNarration>Much of Earth's continental crust comprises Precambrian through Cenozoic orogens,&lt;br/&gt;where preexisting rocks have been variably modified by metamorphism and deformation. Owing&lt;br/&gt;to the association between collisional tectonic events and mountain building, this long record of&lt;br/&gt;orogenesis provides the most accessible means of reconstructing paleotectonic settings and&lt;br/&gt;events that have shaped our planet. Although the Appalachian mountains are widely used to&lt;br/&gt;illustrate Earth's tectonic evolution and associated orogenesis, collisional processes and events&lt;br/&gt;that drove the Ordovician Taconian orogeny in the Quebec Maine segment of the northern&lt;br/&gt;Appalachians remain enigmatic. Deformational features in this region cannot be satisfactorily&lt;br/&gt;related to a specific convergent setting or collisional event(s) because the nature of the eastern&lt;br/&gt;(present coordinates) Laurentian margin during the early Paleozoic is poorly understood.&lt;br/&gt;Interpretations are divided as to whether the orogeny was caused by ophiolite emplacement,&lt;br/&gt;island-arc collision, or microcontinent collision. Because the Taconian orogeny initiated the&lt;br/&gt;Appalachian mountain-building cycle, understanding its architecture and evolution is essential&lt;br/&gt;for understanding the Appalachians as a whole.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to investigate structural, metamorphic, and temporal relationships among the&lt;br/&gt;rock units that make up the Chain Lakes massif and Boil Mountain ophiolite in order to test&lt;br/&gt;competing models and hypotheses for the Taconian orogeny in the northern Appalachians. Their&lt;br/&gt;multidisciplinary approach incorporates mapping, structural, microstructural, metamorphic, and&lt;br/&gt;geochronological studies. Integrating field and laboratory studies, the PI will establish: (a) the&lt;br/&gt;relative and absolute timing of metamorphic and deformational events within the Chain Lakes&lt;br/&gt;massif, (b) the crystallization age of the mafic portion of the Boil Mountain ophiolite, (c) the age&lt;br/&gt;and kinematics of ophiolite emplacement, (d) whether mafic volcanic rocks near the ophiolite&lt;br/&gt;represent a genetic part of the ophiolite, and (e) the age of possibly rift-related mafic dikes in the&lt;br/&gt;Chain Lakes massif. The geochronology portion of the project will include in-situ U-Pb analyses&lt;br/&gt;of monazite to provide high temporal resolution for metamorphic events, small-number&lt;br/&gt;multigrain U-Pb analyses of zircon or baddeleyite from gabbro to determine the crystallization&lt;br/&gt;age of the ophiolite, U-Pb analyses of zircon to establish the age of the dikes, and laser step-&lt;br/&gt;heating 40 Ar- 39 Ar analysis of muscovite to determine the minimum ophiolite emplacement age.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will compare his results with existing interpretations of the Thetford Mines ophiolite and&lt;br/&gt;overlying units in southern Quebec, the Maquereau Dome in the Gaspe Peninsula, and the&lt;br/&gt;Dashwoods Subzone in Newfoundland in order to evaluate temporal and spatial relationships&lt;br/&gt;among these potentially correlative units. Because the extents and boundaries of terranes are&lt;br/&gt;fundamental components of the tectonic models, testing the terrane relationships will test the&lt;br/&gt;models. The work will clarify the nature of the Taconian orogeny in the northern Appalachians,&lt;br/&gt;and will bear on conceptual models describing Iapetan paleogeographic reconstruction and&lt;br/&gt;collisional accretionary processes.</AbstractNarration>
