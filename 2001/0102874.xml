    <AbstractNarration>Texas Southern University (TSU) proposes a Science and Technology Enhancement &lt;br/&gt;Program (STEP) One-Year Planning Grant to the NSF Historically Black College and &lt;br/&gt;University Undergraduate Program (HBCU UP). The objective is to increase the &lt;br/&gt;recruitment, retention and graduation rates of students in undergraduate programs&lt;br/&gt; in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET) areas through quality&lt;br/&gt; enhancements of teaching and student learning at the University. The TSU STEP&lt;br/&gt; will achieve this overall objective through four (4) programmatic thrusts: &lt;br/&gt;Student recruitment and retention for academic success, Faculty development &lt;br/&gt;in teaching and scholarly achievements, Curricular reforms through use of &lt;br/&gt;technology, and Assessment and evaluation for sustainability beyond NSF funding.&lt;br/&gt; These programmatic thrusts will have measurable goals and timelines to achieve&lt;br/&gt; the overall objectives of the TSU STEP. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During this one-year planning period the TSU STEP will develop a comprehensive&lt;br/&gt; recruitment and retention plan for science and technology. Industry will become an&lt;br/&gt; integral part of the S&amp;T programs trough establishing a Corporate and Professional&lt;br/&gt; Advisory Committee for the College of Science and Technology and a discipline&lt;br/&gt; specific one for each department. Comprehensive plans to assist faculty teaching &lt;br/&gt;with technology and enhancing their research capacity will be developed. Each&lt;br/&gt; undergraduate academic program will recommend improvements in their curriculum&lt;br/&gt; to enhance the quality of the education. An assessment and evaluation plan will be&lt;br/&gt; developed such that the TSU STEP will be sustainable after NSF funding has expired.</AbstractNarration>
