    <AbstractNarration>This project is instituting a Biotechnology Technician A.A.S. degree in response to state needs. More than 116 biotechnology firms are located in Utah with 57 moving in during the last eighteen months. These firms employ individuals focused on work in genetic engineering, bioinfomatics, molecular biology, and pharmaceutical development. Partners include the community college, local industries, universities in Utah, and 5 public school districts. Prior to this program, no two-year biotechnology programs were available in Utah or neighboring states. Industry representatives are involved in outlining skills competencies, delivering instruction and facilitating instructor professional development. Outcomes for this project include: (1) establishing reciprocal partnerships with local industry; (2) identifying, adapting and implementing secondary and college curriculum; (3) preparing college and secondary instructional staff; (4) supporting industry internships for faculty and students; (5) developing a state of the art instructional laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
