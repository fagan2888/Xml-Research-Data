    <AbstractNarration>Priority effects - influences of species already present in a community on the successful colonization by later arriving species - are important during the formation of ecological communities (community assembly). Because of increasing habitat fragmentation, it is important to understand whether the influence of priority effects can be generalized across locations. The proposed research examines priority effects in a model system: insect and spider communities inhabiting creosote bush in Arizona. Experiments will be conducted in two habitat types (i.e., desert remnants and outlying desert areas) that previous research found to differ in degree of fragmentation, diversity, recovery following disturbance, and response to priority effects. Research will investigate the influence of two predatory pioneer colonists on community recovery and determine how long priority effects are detectable in community assembly. This approach to community ecology will illustrate the importance of initial conditions during species assembly that will be useful to restoration ecologists working in fragmented habitats.</AbstractNarration>
