    <AbstractNarration>The Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) conference entitled "Post-Transcriptional Control of Gene Expression: Effectors of mRNA Decay" will be held July 6-11, 2002 in Tucson, Arizona. The objective of this conference is to provide an opportunity for the cross-fertilization of ideas between workers studying mRNA decay in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. mRNA decay plays a major role in determining the level at which genes are expressed. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of mRNA degradation becomes very important to understanding how genes are regulated. Among the topics planned for this conference are: (1) A keynote overview of mRNA decay at the start of the conference by Dr. Roy Parker (University of Arizona). (2) Multicomponent bacterial nucleases. (3) Multicomponent eukaroytic nucleases. (4) How mRNA transport and localization affect mRNA decay. (5) How translational accuracy affects mRNA decay, including how the premature termination of translation elicits mRNA decay. (6) Cis-acting mRNA sequences and their associated trans-acting factors that affect mRNA decay. (7) RNA as a tool and target for drug design.</AbstractNarration>
