    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0133840 Srinidhi Varadarajan Virginia Polytechnic Institute &amp; State University CAREER: Weaving a Code Tapestry: A Compiler Directed Framework for Scalable Network Emulation &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, we propose a new scalable network emulation test-bed that supports both the simulation as well as direct code execution paradigms within a single framework. In order to represent the scale and heterogeneity of the Internet, the test-bed scales to tens to hundreds of thousands of network nodes. The first major challenge lies in developing programming models that can represent the digraph relationship of network protocol stacks within a single process, without manually modifying either the protocol stack or network applications. Secondly, the enormous scope of the test bed requires us to address problems in inter application context switch time, memory usage and parallel discrete event simulation, all of which present bottlenecks to scalability.</AbstractNarration>
