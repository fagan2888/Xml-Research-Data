    <AbstractNarration>Through funding provided by the National Science Foundation, the Nature Museum of the &lt;br/&gt;Chicago Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with El Valor and James Ward School &lt;br/&gt;will create Girls Online: GO Team! , an innovative after-school science and technology &lt;br/&gt;program that targets girls between the ages of eleven and thirteen living in &lt;br/&gt;underserved areas of Chicago. This pilot program will offer engaging science activities&lt;br/&gt;and real-world applications to teachhands-on science and technology to approximately&lt;br/&gt;450 girls over a three-year period. Each semester, between forty-five and ninety girls&lt;br/&gt; will join the GO Team! at locations in their own neighborhoods. Of the girls who excel &lt;br/&gt;in this after-school program, six will be selected every semester to return and team &lt;br/&gt;teach with Academy staff to a new group of participating girls. As the girls grow in &lt;br/&gt;competency and skills, they can attend a more advanced GO Team! the following&lt;br/&gt; semester. The participating girls will attend weekly lab sessions taught by &lt;br/&gt;educators and scientists from the Academy, have fun with their families at a &lt;br/&gt;Kick -Off celebration and a Graduation Ceremony, learn about science and technology &lt;br/&gt;careers during a job shadow day with museum staff and outside professionals, and&lt;br/&gt;learn how science and technology impact their everyday lives. Successful women &lt;br/&gt;mentors will function as teachers and role models to help build the girls' science &lt;br/&gt;knowledge, career choices, and self-esteem.</AbstractNarration>
