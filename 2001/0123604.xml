    <AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to support an expansion of the Women in Science and Engineering&lt;br/&gt;(WISE) Project in the Women's and Gender Studies (WGS) Program at North Carolina&lt;br/&gt;State University. The WISE project promotes the advancement of women and people of&lt;br/&gt;color in science and engineering through the integration of women's studies into the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate curriculum via faculty development seminars. The current&lt;br/&gt;proposal is for two years of funding to support companion seminars for interested faculty&lt;br/&gt;and graduate students. The immediate goals of the proposed seminar project are to foster&lt;br/&gt;community among the participants, address their interests in theory and research from&lt;br/&gt;women's studies, and promote informed conversation within science and engineering&lt;br/&gt;departments and classrooms. The long-term goals of the proposed seminar project are to provide an institutionally sustainable vehicle for the recruitment and retention of women and people of color as faculty and graduate students in science and engineering, promote the national dialogue about best practices in accomplishing this, and contribute new scholarship by and about women in science and engineering to&lt;br/&gt;the field of women's studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
