    <AbstractNarration>This proposal highlights the role of the Hardy-Littlewood &lt;br/&gt;(circle) method as a flexible tool that underpins progress &lt;br/&gt;in many areas of mathematics intersecting with number theory.&lt;br/&gt; The proposer intends to pursue a number of investigations &lt;br/&gt;that illustrate this intersubdisciplinary aspect of the method, &lt;br/&gt;concentrating on applications in arithmetic geometry and &lt;br/&gt;combinatorics. First, the researcher constructs a large class&lt;br/&gt; of examples of algebraic varieties, of relatively small &lt;br/&gt;dimension in terms of their degree, that may be studied by &lt;br/&gt;means of the circle method. Questions concerning the density &lt;br/&gt;of rational points and weak approximation should be accessible,&lt;br/&gt;the intention being to shed light on conjectures of Manin and&lt;br/&gt;others. In a second direction, the proposer applies results &lt;br/&gt;from the modern theory of diophantine approximation in order &lt;br/&gt;to refine Gower's recent explicit version of Szemeredi's &lt;br/&gt;theorem. In a more traditional line of enquiry, the researcher&lt;br/&gt;investigates the distribution of the number of &lt;br/&gt;representations of integers as sums of powers. The latter work &lt;br/&gt;enables higher moments than the traditional mean square to be &lt;br/&gt;considered, leading to multidimensional applications of &lt;br/&gt;previously inaccessible type.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number Theory studies the properties of integers (``whole &lt;br/&gt;numbers''). Since antiquity, the study of diophantine equations &lt;br/&gt;(equations to be solved in integers) has formed a core component &lt;br/&gt;of Number Theory, and has recently influenced the development of &lt;br/&gt;codes and cryptosystems (applied, for example, in data storage &lt;br/&gt;systems such as compact disks and DVDs, communications systems and &lt;br/&gt;banking security). The investigation of moment problems is a &lt;br/&gt;fundamental topic for Fourier analysis, which in the larger setting &lt;br/&gt;plays a crucial role in electrical engineering and communications. &lt;br/&gt;The circle method, in its modern incarnations, provides a mechanism &lt;br/&gt;for transferring technology from one of these areas to another, &lt;br/&gt;and this proposal pursues basic research that facilitates such transfers.</AbstractNarration>
