    <AbstractNarration>0140027&lt;br/&gt;Leifer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a one year planning visit between Professor Ira Leifer at the University of California at Santa Barbara and Professor Tomoaki Kunugi of Kyoto University in Japan and Professor Katsumi Tsuchiya of the University of Tokushima in Japan. The researchers will devise a plan to improve understanding of the behavior of deep-sea bubbles by intercomparing field observations with laboratory studies. Currently, few studies exist in the literature on these bubbles, and thus incorporation of appropriate parameterizations of deep-sea bubble behavior (chemico-hydrodynamic) into numerical simulations requires potentially unjustified assumptions. Research to generate more realistic parameterizations will improve the accuracy of numerical models of processes such as hydrocarbon seepage bubble-mediated gas transfer into the ocean and atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will facilitate collaboration between three groups with complementary expertise and capabilities, allowing an important technical problem to be addressed with a broad array of modern methods. Professor Leifer has expertise both in laboratory research of bubble hydrodynamics (at atmospheric pressure) and field bubble observations at depths from 20 to 540 m. Professor Tsuchiya has experience in laboratory research both at atmospheric and high pressure, and is a well-recognized theoretical expert on bubbles and bubble wake hydrodynamics. Professor Kunugi is a well-recognized expert on direct numerical simulation of two-phase flows. The project will offer a good opportunity to join efforts between the two countries. This research impacts important areas such as oceanic carbon dioxide injection to counter human emissions, studying the fate of seep oil and hydrocarbons in the environment, and the use of rising seep bubbles for location of marine petroleum resources. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.</AbstractNarration>
