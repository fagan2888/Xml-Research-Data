    <AbstractNarration>0118022&lt;br/&gt;Das &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports US-Nepal cooperative research entitled "Theoretical and Experimental Investigations on Some Current Electronic Structure Related Topics in Condensed Matter Systems and Ozone-UV Interaction." This is an initiating activity among the Theoretical Electronic Structure and Properties Research Group, University at Albany, State University of New York, the Condensed Matter and Atmospheric Physics Research Group, Tribhuvan University (TU), and the Condensed Matter and Materials Physics Experimental Research Group, University of Central Florida (UCF). This project covers five diverse areas of research that include glasses, quantum computation dealing with solar radiation and upper atmosphere chemistry, studies of hyperfine interactions of electron distributions in materials, ozone depletion and environmental impacts in Nepal, and a solar cell fabrication capability at TU. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This award launches joint activities between two US universities and the Tribhuvan University, Nepal. Topics were selected according to common interests at these institutions between theory and experimental groups in a way that complement their expertise and enhance the potential for future interactions among the three groups. Faculty and students at TU will gain expertise in experimental aspects of Moessbauer spectroscopy and characterization of electronic structures of materials. In the long-term, research on solar cell thin films and nanocrystalline particles corresponds to Nepalese national development interests. This is the first cooperative research project in physics supported under the US-Nepal Cooperative Science Program. It is jointly supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Materials Research, Condensed Matter Physics Program.</AbstractNarration>
