    <AbstractNarration>Boston Public Schools&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Boston Public School District (BPS) proposes to advance significantly the science, mathematics, and technology (SMT) education of all K-12 students through the Boston Urban Systemic Program (BUSP). The District plans to accomplish this task by building on the existing infrastructure developed by reform efforts that began in 1995. These efforts included a complete revision of the reading, Language Arts, and mathematics programs. The lessons learned from these efforts will be used to facilitate change in science and other core subjects. The foundational tenets of the extant infrastructure include a strong K-12 leadership team, a standards-based curriculum for science and mathematics based on the state's curriculum framework, an aligned assessment system, and policies specific to science and mathematics. The infrastructure also include the convergence of fiscal and intellectual resources to improve science and mathematics education, significant external support from multiple institutions of higher education, business partners, and the at-large community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BUSP goals parallel those of the USP that seeks to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Increase student achievement in science and mathematics as measured by higher scores on standards-based assessments, increasing enrollments in higher level courses, and greater articulation to institutions of higher education; &lt;br/&gt;2. Advance the implementation of standards-based, inquiry-centered science and mathematics program for all students, and employ research and assessments as effective tools in improving the teaching and learning of science and mathematics; &lt;br/&gt;3. Increase the competency and diversity of the science and mathematics instructional workforce; and &lt;br/&gt;4. Promote collaborations with colleges and universities and the engagement of the community to improve teaching and learning for all students to meet high standards.</AbstractNarration>
