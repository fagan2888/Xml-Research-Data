    <AbstractNarration>Joint Performance Optimization of Wireless Networks and Control Systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current control technology is not well suited&lt;br/&gt;to operation over a packet based network, and conversely,&lt;br/&gt;most networks are not optimized for control applications. &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, critical network performance parameters that affect control&lt;br/&gt;system performance, such as bit rates&lt;br/&gt;and delay and packet loss statistics, depend on various&lt;br/&gt;choices made in the network, such as powers allocated to wireless&lt;br/&gt;transmitters, bandwidths or time-slot fractions allocated to &lt;br/&gt;channels, and routing methods.&lt;br/&gt;So in addition to the challenge of working out how a control&lt;br/&gt;system can be made to work in a packet-based &lt;br/&gt;networked environment, we also&lt;br/&gt;have the challenge of working out how the network should be &lt;br/&gt;configured, or operated, so as to improve control system performance.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses two fundamental issues that arise.&lt;br/&gt;Neither solves the whole problem, but each addresses a critical issue.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first topic involves joint optimization of&lt;br/&gt;a controller and critical communication and network&lt;br/&gt;parameters such as transmit powers, packet routing, and&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth and time-slot allocation. &lt;br/&gt;To simplify this problem, only the affects of these&lt;br/&gt;network parameters on bit rates, hence quantization noise, is &lt;br/&gt;considered. The second topic considered is&lt;br/&gt;simultaneous routing and resource allocation for wireless&lt;br/&gt;data networks.&lt;br/&gt;This is the problem of jointly finding an optimal set&lt;br/&gt;of flows and communication resources that maximize the performance of&lt;br/&gt;the network, with respect to some objective such as optimal&lt;br/&gt;control system performance.&lt;br/&gt;Here we hope to develop algorithms to dynamically allocate&lt;br/&gt;communication resources (such as transmit powers, bandwidth)&lt;br/&gt;and simultaneously optimize routing decisions.</AbstractNarration>
