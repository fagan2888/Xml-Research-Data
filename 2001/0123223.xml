    <AbstractNarration>This program is designed to encourage talented but economically disadvantaged students to major in mathematics, computer science, and CIS at Towson University and to assist them in being successful in its completion. The program pro-actively solicits applications from districts that have significant populations of women and ethnic minority students, since those groups have not chosen these programs in large numbers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Towson University coordinates and supervises the designated cohort groups through three management committees, provides support services, and provides additional financial support from the two centers in the College of Science and Mathematics and from existing corporate partners. Regular academic support services are available to these scholars, including matriculation and admission assistance, advisement and counseling, tutoring, career advisement, securing internships or part-time employment, and assistance with job placement at graduation. In addition to these services, scholars are expected to participate in a special support community, have access to specialized tutoring assistance, and be given financial assistance for joining a student chapter of a national professional association.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though all the regular student support mechanisms on campus are available for this group, a coalition of educators, students, and local professionals serve to support them and to provide a nurturing community of scholars to assure their success.</AbstractNarration>
