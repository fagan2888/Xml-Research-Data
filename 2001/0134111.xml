    <AbstractNarration>Deformation Mechanisms at the Materials' Microstructural Length Scale&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this CAREER project is to integrate the study of the microscale materials behavior with a modern educational program in the area of the mechanical properties of materials. The proposed strategy is to develop an integrated experimental-numerical framework, which will attempt to stimulate student curiosity to explore the deformation mechanisms at these length scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is to study the evolution of the heterogeneous deformation fields and the history of hardening using a unique combination of efforts at the proper microstructure length scale. The fundamental principles are quite general and may be applied to many advanced materials systems that comprise deformation or material removal at the micro/nano scale. The research objective will be realized through: 1) development of unique and stable testing configurations for advanced materials structures; 2) development of proper experimental techniques for full-field, finite-deformation measurements to monitor the evolution of the heterogeneous deformation and hardening at the proper length scale; and 3) applications of this approach to the deformation induced crack tip toughening and the interfacial toughening of layered structures. The measurements will be the benchmark tests against which both phenomenological models and discrete dislocation dynamics will be calibrated. The provided quantitative understanding will be carried over to: 1) the mechanism-based modeling "or better informed continuum models" employing finite element analysis, and 2) the possible hierarchies of multi-scale modeling through collaborations with Ames National Lab. This will allow a significant expansion in our ability to simulate the material behavior and address its reliability at such scales. This is a fundamental requirement for achieving further technological advancement for these advanced materials' systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed educational vision integrates a modern view of mechanical properties of materials into the Iowa State University mechanics of materials curriculum, providing individuals in academia and industry with specialized knowledge in mechanical properties in small dimensions and the advanced experimental and computational techniques. Utilizing the myriad of web-based instructional research and resources, a specialized web-based experimental mechanics curriculum will be developed. In addition, a small research oriented group that facilitates interaction among honor and special-program students will be developed to give them the opportunity to express their curiosity in understanding the mechanics of materials and structure behaviors.</AbstractNarration>
