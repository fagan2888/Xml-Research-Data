    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to integrate research activities with educational efforts in two interdisciplinary fields: layered manufacturing and smart materials and structures. Currently, little has been reported on integrating these two fields, especially at the mesoscale (100 mm to 10 mm). In addition, fundamental issues for mesoscale layered manufacturing processes have not been well defined or investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program involves research on mesoscale layered manufacturing of smart structures with a special focus on thermomechanical issues at the mesoscale. The approach is to integrate laser-assisted Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) and Laser Direct Write to build, at the mesoscale, geometrically, compositionally, and functionally complex smart structures containing embedded micro sensors and actuators. Analytical models, numerical simulation, and embedded micro sensors will be used to investigate the thermomechanical phenomena. The educational plan is to improve the existing curriculum in the arena of manufacturing by developing new interdisciplinary elements that integrate the fields of layered manufacturing, micro-manufacturing, and smart materials and structures. Additionally, there will be substantial effort to mentor undergraduate and graduate students, and to expose K-12 students, teachers, and industries to novel manufacturing processes and smart devices. Strategies will be explored to attract, retain, and engage students from under-represented groups (women and especially students with disabilities) to manufacturing fields. The research program will have significant implications for industry in that mesoscale smart devices could become technologically and economically feasible for numerous applications. Emphasis on interdisciplinary materials, hands-on experience, teamwork, and high quality teaching and learning will better engineering education for next generation engineers.</AbstractNarration>
