    <AbstractNarration>There are two main approches to motivic (co-)homology appearing in&lt;br/&gt;recent years. First, one tries to construct it as cohomology groups&lt;br/&gt;of certain complexes with terms being given by explicit&lt;br/&gt;generators and relations generalizing Milnor's K-groups. Second, one&lt;br/&gt;can construct cohomology of a scheme as cohomology of a complex&lt;br/&gt;defined in terms of algebraic cycles thus generalizing the classical&lt;br/&gt;defintion of Chow groups. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Jianqiang Zhao's research will continue his work&lt;br/&gt;on understanding both approaches by using&lt;br/&gt;polylogarithms and their generalizations. &lt;br/&gt;Polylogarithms have been around for centuries in one form or&lt;br/&gt;another, but only recently has their whole theory become available. &lt;br/&gt;They have deep connections with both number theory and modern &lt;br/&gt;mathematical physics. This project should shed light on these connections. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is in the field of arithmetic algebraic geometry, &lt;br/&gt;a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic geometry and number&lt;br/&gt;theory. In its original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures &lt;br/&gt;that could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, &lt;br/&gt;namely polynomials. Number theory&lt;br/&gt;is the study of numbers that can be expressed in&lt;br/&gt;terms of whole numbers, 1, 2, 3... In the second half&lt;br/&gt;of last century these two seemingly far apart subjects have produced &lt;br/&gt;tremendous impact on each other. The field of arithmetic algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
