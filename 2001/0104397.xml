    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0104397.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will study two groups of problems related to&lt;br/&gt;physical models of topological string theory and two-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;gravity and their interaction with geometry and other branches of&lt;br/&gt;mathematics. Based on physical ideas and methods, E.Witten&lt;br/&gt;conjectured that certain topological invariants of the moduli spaces&lt;br/&gt;of Riemann surfaces with higher spin structures assemble in a&lt;br/&gt;generating function that can be determined by an infinite system of&lt;br/&gt;differential equations (the so-called Gelfand-Dickey hierarchy).&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the first part of the proposal is to study geometric and&lt;br/&gt;algebraic structures related to this conjecture by using techniques&lt;br/&gt;from the theory of Gromov-Witten invariants and quantum&lt;br/&gt;cohomology. Besides exposing deep connections between seemingly&lt;br/&gt;unrelated areas of geometry and analysis, a goal of this part of the&lt;br/&gt;project is to develop tools for analyzing more general cohomological&lt;br/&gt;field theories of spin type and the corresponding spin analogs of&lt;br/&gt;quantum cohomology and Gromov-Witten invariants. The second part of&lt;br/&gt;the proposal is related to applications and generalizations of the&lt;br/&gt;so-called chiral de Rham complex, a canonical sheaf of vertex&lt;br/&gt;algebras introduced in joint work with Malikov and Schechtman. The&lt;br/&gt;main goal here is to find a rigorous geometric foundation for the&lt;br/&gt;physical models of two-dimensional superconformal field theory on&lt;br/&gt;smooth varieties and orbifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;String theory is a proposed physical theory which attempts to unify&lt;br/&gt;all kinds of forces and, in particular, combines Einstein's theory&lt;br/&gt;of gravity with the quantum theory. Because this theory cannot yet&lt;br/&gt;be verified on experiments, physicists working in string theory are&lt;br/&gt;testing it on sophisticated mathematical models. Often the same&lt;br/&gt;physical quantity can be computed by more than one method which&lt;br/&gt;gives answers expressed in terms of very different mathematical&lt;br/&gt;structures. This suggests the existence of deep ties between various&lt;br/&gt;seemingly remote parts of mathematics and leads to formulation of&lt;br/&gt;non-trivial conjectures connecting different mathematical objects,&lt;br/&gt;usually geometric and analytical in nature. The goal of the current&lt;br/&gt;project is a mathematical study of some of these conjectures and&lt;br/&gt;interactions. Besides producing new mathematical results, it should&lt;br/&gt;give mathematical verification of some physical models and provide&lt;br/&gt;more direct links between mathematical and physical methods of&lt;br/&gt;analysis of these models.</AbstractNarration>
