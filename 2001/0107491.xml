    <AbstractNarration>In diverse world regions such as the Americas, Europe and South &lt;br/&gt;Asia, free-market policies have forced small-scale farmers to transform &lt;br/&gt;their productive strategies or face economic ruin. Peasant and &lt;br/&gt;small-farmer organizations that once were oriented almost exclusively &lt;br/&gt;toward national-level efforts to obtain local-level benefits are now &lt;br/&gt;increasingly seeking allies across national borders, attempting to affect &lt;br/&gt;global forces which impact their rural livelihoods. In some cases this has &lt;br/&gt;resulted in violent actions such as the French peasants' destruction of a &lt;br/&gt;McDonalds restaurant in a protest against "fast food"; and Indian farmers &lt;br/&gt;burning a field of genetically modified cotton as a protest against &lt;br/&gt;agribusiness. This anthropological project studies a new international &lt;br/&gt;peasant and small farmer organization called Via Campesina, or Peasant &lt;br/&gt;Road, which was founded in 1993 and has affiliates in about sixty &lt;br/&gt;countries. The project will interview small farmer activists and donor NGO &lt;br/&gt;personnel in five sites: Brussels, the headquarters of the European peasant &lt;br/&gt;confederation; Saskatoon, Canada, where the network's Technical Secretariat &lt;br/&gt;is based; Tegucigalpa, Honduras, headquarters of the network's &lt;br/&gt;Organizational Secretariat; Managua, Nicaragua, the base of a Central &lt;br/&gt;American small farmers' network that helped found the Peasant Road; and &lt;br/&gt;Bangalore, India, home of one of the most active of the network's &lt;br/&gt;constituent organizations. In each site the interviews and analysis of &lt;br/&gt;documentary materials will focus on the political formation of activist individuals, the histories of &lt;br/&gt;organizational consolidation, and the mobilization of resources and &lt;br/&gt;alliances. The project will examine what movements defending economically &lt;br/&gt;marginal constituencies gain and lose by forming part of global civil &lt;br/&gt;society, as well as how new varieties of transnational politics have shaped &lt;br/&gt;peasant and small farmer identities, both within the agriculturist &lt;br/&gt;organizations and in relation to their NGO backers and antagonists. The new &lt;br/&gt;knowledge generated by this proposal will advance our understanding of how &lt;br/&gt;comparable grass-roots and global organizations function.</AbstractNarration>
