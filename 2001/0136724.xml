    <AbstractNarration>This award to Professor Frank Gomez of the California State University, Los Angeles, is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. A primary objective is to couple on-column reactions with affinity-based separations for the dual purposes of high-throughput synthesis and rapid analysis. In addition, capillary electrophoresis will be further developed to assess binding constants for substrate-protein and substrate-DNA interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New analytical techniques are needed for the study of disease and improve public health. The proposed studies will focus on developing these new techniques by examining model biological systems with the long-term goal of developing useful techniques to study diseases including cancer, Alzheimer's, and Parkinsons. In addition, the proposed research effort will provide undergraduate and minority students a solid background in chemistry by examining problems at the interface of chemistry and chemistry-related disciplines. The research projects planned for the participants are aimed at demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of CE and its importance as a new and exciting instrument in solving broad scientific problems.</AbstractNarration>
