    <AbstractNarration>The foci of this research are fourfold and all involve the development of methodology based on the use of chiral tert-butanesulfinamide. The goals include: Asymmetric synthesis and applications of highly substituted beta-amino acids; reactions of metalloenamines derived from tert-butanesulfinyl imines, in particular for the synthesis of 1,3-amino alcohols; parallel asymmetric synthesis of amines in solution and solid support for the rapid preparation of natural products and compounds with interesting biological properties; development of tert-butanesulfinamide derived ligands as a new class of ligands for asymmetric catalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Jonathan A. Ellman of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Ellman will focus his work on exploring the applications of tert-butanesulfinamide to asymmetric synthesis. Since more than 75% of drugs and drug candidates contain amine functionality, the work could have significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. The research also provides an excellent training ground for students in current organic synthesis.</AbstractNarration>
