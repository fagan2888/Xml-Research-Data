    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER proposal combines a research program on the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;mechanics of web handing systems with two curriculum development projects.&lt;br/&gt;The research development plan in web handling is motivated by the needs of&lt;br/&gt;companies in many industries, including 3M, Kodak, Procter &amp; Gamble, and SRS&lt;br/&gt;Technologies, to better understand and more rapidly process thin, flexible&lt;br/&gt;material. These handling processes produce a wide variety of products such&lt;br/&gt;as carpet, fabric, shrink-wrap, diapers, and paper towel. Universal issues&lt;br/&gt;that prevent more efficient operation-such as slip in wound rolls,&lt;br/&gt;wrinkling, creasing, and vibration-will be studied. The fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions answered by this research will allow companies to more rapidly and&lt;br/&gt;efficiently produce their products. The curriculum development plan has two&lt;br/&gt;major thrusts. The first thrust will be the development of two unique&lt;br/&gt;courses concerning the mathematical modelling of solids and structures.&lt;br/&gt;These courses will expose students to modelling issues that occur in the&lt;br/&gt;study of web handling systems and throughout engineering. The second thrust&lt;br/&gt;will be an extensive overhaul of Penn States required undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;vibrations course. One section will be combined with the optional&lt;br/&gt;vibrations laboratory class. Additionally, the studio concept, combining&lt;br/&gt;lecture, laboratory and recitation into one educational experience, will be&lt;br/&gt;introduced. Along with traditional lectures, small teams of students will&lt;br/&gt;use classroom computers to complete activities, allowing them to more&lt;br/&gt;thoroughly learn the subject.</AbstractNarration>
