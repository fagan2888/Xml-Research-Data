    <AbstractNarration>Two international workshops on Industrial Ecology and Environmentally Benign Manufacturing towards Dematerialization are to be held October 2 - 5, 2001 at Tokai University in Hawaii. Two - 2 day sessions will be held in conjunction with the International Conference on Ecomaterials (Oct 2-4) with a final day dedicated to summarizing results of the meetings and producing a report. It is expected that participants will come from universities, governmental organizations, and corporations and trade organizations from around the world. The organizing committee is represented by Japanese universities, industry and national laboratories. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 2001 ecomaterials conference will be the fifth in a series of international conferences that have been sponsored by the Japanese. All previous conferences have taken place in Japan or the Far East. With this conference the founders hope to expand the venue and include American and other nationalities to discuss many different aspects of manufacturing, design and materials processing and their impact on the environment.</AbstractNarration>
