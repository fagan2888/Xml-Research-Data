    <AbstractNarration>Theoretical calculations of coalescing compact binaries (mergers of two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole) will be performed using 3-D hydrodynamic techniques on parallel supercomputers. These calculations will include, for the first time ever, a complete treatment of all lowest-order post-Newtonian effects (i.e., the most important corrections to Newtonian gravity imposed by Einstein's general theory of relativity). In particular, the dissipative effects due to the emission of gravitational waves will be included in the hydrodynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These calculations will provide us with a much more accurate description of the binary coalescence process, including more accurate theoretical predictions for the gravitational radiation signals that may soon become detectable by laser interferometer detectors such as LIGO. They will also help us understand the mechanisms that may be important for producing the most powerful gamma-ray bursts observed by astronomers throughout the visible Universe.</AbstractNarration>
