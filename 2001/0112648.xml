    <AbstractNarration>I propose to initiate a lending program to share science resources and equipment with&lt;br/&gt;pre-service and in-service teachers and schools in the Monterey Bay region. K-12 teachers&lt;br/&gt;have a great need for access to scientific equipment and for support in using scientific&lt;br/&gt;equipment in their teaching. The University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) is well&lt;br/&gt;positioned to increase the access of regional schools to its own scientific equipment&lt;br/&gt;through its outreach wing, the Educational Partnership Center (EPC), and its Division of&lt;br/&gt;Natural Sciences. My Post-doctoral Fellowship in Science, Math, Engineering, and&lt;br/&gt;Technology Education (PFSMETE) involved the acquisition of a basic set of scientific&lt;br/&gt;equipment useful for various kinds of environmental monitoring by K-12 students. The&lt;br/&gt;lending program I propose would use this existing equipment to provide follow-up support&lt;br/&gt;for teachers with whom I worked on environmental monitoring projects during my&lt;br/&gt;post-doctoral fellowship. It would also serve as a seed project for a larger&lt;br/&gt;university-based equipment-sharing programs.</AbstractNarration>
