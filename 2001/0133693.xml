    <AbstractNarration>Computational complexity is the study of the inherent difficulty of&lt;br/&gt;computational problems. The theory considers various models of &lt;br/&gt;computation, such as classical computers, probabilistic computers, &lt;br/&gt;and quantum computers. For each of these, it aims to describe how many &lt;br/&gt;resources are needed to compute the solution to a problem as a function&lt;br/&gt;of the problem size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most prominent open question in complexity theory is whether the&lt;br/&gt;ability to efficiently verify the validity of a candidate solution &lt;br/&gt;implies the ability to efficiently compute a valid solution (assuming&lt;br/&gt;one exists). The question is usually stated in terms of the &lt;br/&gt;corresponding classes of computational problems: Is NP contained in P? &lt;br/&gt;Lots of computational problems from virtually any discipline fall in&lt;br/&gt;the class NP but are not known to be in P. Therefore, a positive answer &lt;br/&gt;to the P versus NP question would have tremendous algorithmic implications. &lt;br/&gt;It would also imply a way to break any public-key cryptographic system, &lt;br/&gt;as the security of such systems rests on the assumption that a particular &lt;br/&gt;problem in NP does not belong to P.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project aims to develop techniques for determining the &lt;br/&gt;relationships between complexity classes like P and NP: separations &lt;br/&gt;and inclusions. On the separation side, the investigators focus on &lt;br/&gt;techniques that do not suffer from the known pitfalls of relativization &lt;br/&gt;and natural proofs. In particular, they concentrate on indirect &lt;br/&gt;diagonalization and exhibiting distinguishing properties of complete &lt;br/&gt;problems. On the inclusion side, the emphasis lies on efficient &lt;br/&gt;classical simulations of time and space bounded probabilistic and &lt;br/&gt;quantum computations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational goal consists of the development of graduate courses &lt;br/&gt;on pseudo-randomness and derandomization and on quantum computing. At &lt;br/&gt;the undergraduate level, the investigators plan to further the &lt;br/&gt;integration of discrete structures in the core curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
