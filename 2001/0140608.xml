    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Karen A. High&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Oklahoma State University&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0140608&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Woman's Initiative Committee Session entitled "Women Engineering Sucess from the Inside Out" will be held at the annual American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) meeting in Reno, Nevada. It will be a full morning session from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. with speakers including women from industry, academia government. Some of the presentations include:&lt;br/&gt; - Barbara Todd, from Phillips Petroleum, presenting "A History of Four Female &lt;br/&gt;Chemical Engineering Graduates from the 1930's."&lt;br/&gt;- Carol Muller, from MentorNet, discussing "Opening the 'Black Box' of Mentoring".&lt;br/&gt;- Valerie Young, from Making Waves, detaling "Overcoming the Imposter Syndrome: &lt;br/&gt; A workshop for Women."&lt;br/&gt;- Peggy Layne, from the National Academy of Engineering, describing the "NAE Program on Diversity in the Engineering Workforce."&lt;br/&gt;The presentations will be followed by a luncheon sponsored by corporate sponsors, hopefully to attract 50 to 75 chemical engineering professionals, faculty members and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The session is a part of a more comprehensive program to help women at all stages of their careers - from graduate student to tenured faculty as well as women in various industrial positions in the chemical process industries - to advance in their careers. Some of the women are pregnant and can not attend the meeting. Arrangements have been made for two-way video conferencing. Philips Petroleum is covering half of the expense, NSF the other half.</AbstractNarration>
