    <AbstractNarration>This award funds a wide range of scholarly and educational &lt;br/&gt;projects related to the principal investigator's research interests &lt;br/&gt;in Number Theory. With regards to his own research, the investigator &lt;br/&gt;plans to study, among other topics, partitions and modular forms, &lt;br/&gt;Gaussian hypergeometric series, character sums, varieties over &lt;br/&gt;finite fields, polynomial-exponential equations, and thedivisors of &lt;br/&gt;modular forms. In addition to his own research, the investigator &lt;br/&gt;will develop a number of new outreach and educational programs at &lt;br/&gt;the high school and undergraduate levels, and will become involved in &lt;br/&gt;training programs at more advanced levels. Specifically, the &lt;br/&gt;investigator will direct workshops for high school students and high &lt;br/&gt;school teachers, will support programs for talented undergraduate &lt;br/&gt;students, and will provide enhanced opportunities for &lt;br/&gt;graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number Theory is a very old branch of mathematics which has &lt;br/&gt;its roots in the study of the whole numbers. In modern times it &lt;br/&gt;has become an important tool in many applied endeavors. For example, &lt;br/&gt;systems which enable secure transmission of data over the internet &lt;br/&gt;are based on Number Theory, as are error correcting codes for &lt;br/&gt;reliable data transmission. The Faculty Early Career Development &lt;br/&gt;(CAREER) Program supports the early development of academic faculty &lt;br/&gt;both as educators and as researchers. The program emphasizes the &lt;br/&gt;development of full, balanced academic careers. This award will &lt;br/&gt;allow the investigator to further develop his ongoing program of &lt;br/&gt;research in Number Theory. It will also support the investigator's &lt;br/&gt;broadly based educational and outreach efforts at the high school, &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels.</AbstractNarration>
