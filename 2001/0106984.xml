    <AbstractNarration>Multicasting has become increasingly important for real-time applications since it is the inherent mode of&lt;br/&gt;delivery in several of them, e.g. teleconferencing, audio and video broadcasting, etc. The Internet, however,&lt;br/&gt;does not provide end-to-end bandwidth or delay guarantees for unicast or for multicast data. As a result, a&lt;br/&gt;number of multiple scale encoding schemes for real-time voice and video transmission have been developed;&lt;br/&gt;these schemes allow adaptation both to the available bandwidth and to the receiver capabilities by varying&lt;br/&gt;the number of levels of the information stream and therefore the corresponding bit rates. Thus, bandwidth&lt;br/&gt;and receiver adaptation of multi-level information streams, in multicast delivery in particular, is an issue&lt;br/&gt;of prime importance for the successful, large-scale deployment of those real-time applications. We propose&lt;br/&gt;to investigate and develop methods for bandwidth sharing and adaptation in the context of multicast-&lt;br/&gt;based real-time applications. A set of fairness criteria based on which the performance of different schemes&lt;br/&gt;can be quantified and compared is introduced. A methodology for finding bandwidth allocations that are&lt;br/&gt;optimal or suboptimal with respect to the different criteria is proposed. Scalability with the network size,&lt;br/&gt;amenability to distributed implementation in terms of required control information and speed of convergence&lt;br/&gt;are adopted as prime criteria, in addition to optimality, in the evaluation of the different algorithms. We&lt;br/&gt;propose an approach for the design of the algorithms that allows the trade-off between optimality with&lt;br/&gt;respect to the performance objective and practicality with respect to the other attributes (i.e. scalability&lt;br/&gt;etc.). A methodology for network control in multicasting in the case of unknown traffic and/or network&lt;br/&gt;conditions is proposed as well. It involves explicit back-pressure based congestion notification feedback and&lt;br/&gt;dynamic per ow scheduling. Finally we propose a method for the design of congestion control policies&lt;br/&gt;with the objective of maximizing an aggregate network utility. A relative comparison between the two&lt;br/&gt;approaches (fairness based and aggregate utility maximization) is also proposed in order to be able to select&lt;br/&gt;the most appropriate one in each case.</AbstractNarration>
