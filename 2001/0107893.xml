    <AbstractNarration>Lindquist&lt;br/&gt;0107893&lt;br/&gt; The investigator creates quantitative computational tools&lt;br/&gt;for the automated analysis of neural images, including software&lt;br/&gt;algorithms to provide automated morphology measurements both of&lt;br/&gt;neuron dendrites and of dendritic spines (the primary synaptic&lt;br/&gt;receivers). These tools are developed in close collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with the neural imaging research programs of two groups, led by&lt;br/&gt;Prof. K. Svoboda at Cold Spring Harbor Lab. and by Profs. P. Hof&lt;br/&gt;and S. Wearne at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine. In preliminary&lt;br/&gt;work, automated algorithms have been developed and verified&lt;br/&gt;(against manual measurements) to identify and extract&lt;br/&gt;morphological measurements of dendritic spine length and density&lt;br/&gt;from 3D images. This project develops algorithms to&lt;br/&gt; i) provide spine volume measurements, which are currently&lt;br/&gt;available only through manually intensive, scanning electron&lt;br/&gt;microscopy measurements;&lt;br/&gt; ii) analyze (two-channel) images containing two dyes that&lt;br/&gt;fluoresce at different frequencies. One dye is a marker for&lt;br/&gt;spine morphology, the second is a marker for specific&lt;br/&gt;functionality. This allows for direct correlation studies of&lt;br/&gt;form and function. The primary application of these algorithms&lt;br/&gt;is in structural genetics work.&lt;br/&gt; iii) determine higher moment (shape) measures both of spines&lt;br/&gt;and dendrite cross sections. The primary application of these&lt;br/&gt;algorithms is in developing models of neural integration behavior&lt;br/&gt;and age-related deficits in short-term memory.&lt;br/&gt; Biological science technologies are now capable of producing&lt;br/&gt;data at a rate so fast that only with computers and sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;numerical and statistical algorithms can biologists analyze these&lt;br/&gt;data. In the past decade, laser scanning fluorescence&lt;br/&gt;microscopy, enabling non-invasive, three dimensional imaging of&lt;br/&gt;living neurons, has produced a revolution in neural research.&lt;br/&gt;The wealth of information available from a time sequence of three&lt;br/&gt;dimensional neuron images is outstripping our current information&lt;br/&gt;processing capacity, which has been based upon manual&lt;br/&gt;identification and tracing of structures of interest. Although&lt;br/&gt;it uses the superb recognition capability of human sight, manual&lt;br/&gt;measurement is tedious, susceptible to systematic and hard to&lt;br/&gt;characterize human biases, restricted to measurements involving&lt;br/&gt;only length and counting, and effective only for small data sets.&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to develop computer based tools&lt;br/&gt;for the automated analysis of neuron images, eliminating manual&lt;br/&gt;analysis. The resultant computer tools will make practical such&lt;br/&gt;studies as&lt;br/&gt; i) the relationship between neuron structure and age-related&lt;br/&gt;deficits in memory as well as some forms of mental retardation;&lt;br/&gt; ii) where in neurons certain proteins concentrate and how&lt;br/&gt;their presence and concentration correlates to the signal&lt;br/&gt;processing role of neurons;&lt;br/&gt; iii) large scale screening of drug treatments designed to&lt;br/&gt;correct genetic- or trauma-induced deficiencies in neuron&lt;br/&gt;structure.&lt;br/&gt;The project is supported by the DMS/Computational Mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;DMS/Applied Mathematics, and IBN/Computational Neuroscience&lt;br/&gt;programs and by the MPS/Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.</AbstractNarration>
