    <AbstractNarration>0125414 &lt;br/&gt;Siginer &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to Wichita State University to support the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners are Wichita State University (Lead Institution), Boeing Aircraft Company, Cessna Aircraft Company, Raytheon Aircraft Company, Brittain Machine Inc., Delmia Corporation, Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation, and the Society of Manufacturing Engineers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Activities&lt;br/&gt;The broad objectives of the project include: foment the use of integrated virtual reality models of manufacturing systems by the partners to design, improve, and operate the manufacturing systems, and teach the workforce (new graduates as well as current industry personnel). The following activities support these objectives: integrate the curricula of the industrial engineering and manufacturing engineering programs at Wichita State University using the model that ties the courses together and integrates the applicability of and interrelation between the knowledge and skills gained, provide the students with real-world experience in manufacturing systems, and transfer the computer modeling tools to industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Innovation&lt;br/&gt;The partnership will provide industry with computer modeling tools that are more realistic and system-based for aircraft manufacturing. The new curriculum will provide students with state-of-the-art real world engineering experience that is closer to the needs of the regional aircraft industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;Wichita is home to major manufacturing facilities of Boeing Aircraft Company, Bombardier/Learjet, Cessna Aircraft Company, and Raytheon Aircraft Company. Aviation is responsible for 10% of the earnings in the State of Kansas, and manufacturing is responsible for 60% of the income in Wichita. Since aircraft manufacturers face stiff global competition, innovation is necessary to maintain economic and technological superiority in the aviation manufacturing business. Having state-of-the-art tools and a workforce educated and trained with these tools is absolutely required for survival in this industry sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Societal Impact&lt;br/&gt;Economic well being and jobs for this region are critically dependent upon the aviation industry's maintaining its competitive advantage with tools and people trained to use them.</AbstractNarration>
