    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this Scalable Enterprise Systems award is the creation of an agent-based framework for the simulation of product design, marketing and supply-chain as collaborative processes. This project will develop the enabling theories and technologies needed to support its realization. The framework will use computational agents modeling the human behavior, artificial agents modeling synthetic economies, and constructive agents to address strategic, tactical and operational decision-making problems in simulating product life cycle. These agents use both analytic models and adaptive algorithms such as generic algorithms, fuzzy logic, and neural networks. The agents will compete to provide solutions in these simulations using innovative market metaphors such as auctions and recommendation systems. The research tasks include requirements analysis, preliminary functional analysis, methodology development, initial prototyping, testing, and specifications for the framework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will allow organizations to become aligned to and focused on to changing markets and changing customer values. The proposed collaborative design framework will test strategies necessary to ensure that the product delivery process, the product development process, and marketing initiatives are aligned to address the multiple dimensions of customer values simultaneously. The results will apply in the modeling of the supply chain for convergence technologies and the development of business models for electronic bandwidth exchange. The prototype will be used to support teaching in several courses in Economics and Management.</AbstractNarration>
