    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop prototype software for designing batteries based on user requirements. A user will specify an objective (such as maximize runtime) and use conditions (such as the electrical current), and the software determines, based on first principles(trade mark) models, the optimal design. The Phase I project successfully yielded, based on optimization of capacity, significant improvements in runtime for devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs). The Phase II project will develop a user-friendly, prototype system that can handle multiple battery chemistries, simulate abuse testing, and predict battery life. The software serves as an intermediary between battery developers and users by capturing expertise from both groups, allowing them to accrue benefits of simulation. Aligning development cycles of batteries to devices leads to better products (with concomitant market penetration, share growth, and lower costs). The software protects confidential information of all parties, creating opportunities for broader partnerships. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial benefits will come from the development of the software, which provides a ready outlet for academic research and a rational basis for product specifications. It is anticipated that if this project is successful it will open up the battery industry to innovation and will help to create new partnerships.</AbstractNarration>
