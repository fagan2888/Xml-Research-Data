    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT. Professor Bourdon and his collaborator Joel Shapiro of&lt;br/&gt;Michigan State University will investigate problems arising from the&lt;br/&gt;interaction between the modern theory of linear operators and the&lt;br/&gt;classical theory of analytic functions. The problems to be studied involve&lt;br/&gt;norms, decomposability, and numerical ranges of composition operators as&lt;br/&gt;well as the chaotic behavior of both composition operators and operators&lt;br/&gt;commuting with backward shifts. Insights and tools developed during the&lt;br/&gt;course of the project will be applied to other classes of linear operators&lt;br/&gt;on Hilbert and Banach spaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Many of the differential and integral equations that physicists and&lt;br/&gt;engineers use to model physical processes may be viewed as linear&lt;br/&gt;operators on spaces of functions. This viewpoint, pioneered by David&lt;br/&gt;Hilbert, led to the development of function-theoretic operator theory,&lt;br/&gt;which is the branch of mathematics inspiring the problems that are the&lt;br/&gt;focus of Bourdon and Shapiro's project. A number of these problems concern&lt;br/&gt;the notion of numerical range of a linear operator, an object that has&lt;br/&gt;relevance to quantum physics and that has proven useful to engineers in&lt;br/&gt;determining the stability of certain control systems. Other problems&lt;br/&gt;relate to the chaotic behavior of linear operators. That linear operators&lt;br/&gt;can give rise to chaotic systems is a relatively recent discovery which &lt;br/&gt;has led to unexpected connections between operator theory and dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems. The idea of decomposability--the study of how to break a&lt;br/&gt;complicated linear system up into simpler ones--has been shown to have&lt;br/&gt;surprising connections with such chaotic behavior. The final group of&lt;br/&gt;problems involves norm calculations for composition operators. The norm&lt;br/&gt;of an operator measures how much the operator can stretch the unit ball of&lt;br/&gt;the space on which it acts. Computer experimentation should yield&lt;br/&gt;insights and intuition concerning both composition-operator norms and&lt;br/&gt;numerical ranges. Through such experimentation, undergraduate students at&lt;br/&gt;Washington and Lee University will be given an opportunity to participate&lt;br/&gt;in the project. The training and research experience provided to these&lt;br/&gt;students by the project contribute to its human-resources impact.</AbstractNarration>
