    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0129012&lt;br/&gt;P. Van Tassel, Wayne State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposed workshop is conceived as one of the answers to the NSF's "Grand Challenge in Nanoscale Science and Engineering". It will assess the recent advances (and promise) in the creation and usage of devices and materials of nanometric dimensions. It will be hosted as part of the 2001 annual meeting of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers in Reno NV, with a goal to maximize the exposure of the traditional engineer attendees to the new field of nanotechnology. To achieve this objective, it is proposed to: 1. Invite six leading experts to discuss their views of the research directions most likely to dominate the next ten years. A forum will follow these presentations. 2. Encourage the participation of young promising researchers by having each of the six experts nominate two of them. In summary, this workshop, and its panel discussions, should be an effective device to stimulate collective "brainstorms" among a large number of interested participants. It will also provide an incentive for younger scientists' and industrial scientists' participation.</AbstractNarration>
