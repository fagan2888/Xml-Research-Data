    <AbstractNarration>Computer security is an especially pressing and national need because of the increasing dependence on information systems in most aspects of our lives including business, finance, transportation, medicine, education and national security to name a few. These information technology systems are vulnerable to a variety of events which can compromise the functioning and integrity of the system such as design problems, physical failures, malicious attacks, and scaling problems that can occur within individual components and systems and in the complex interaction among these systems. While there is ongoing research in security such as in computer systems, networks, storage, cryptography, and distributed systems, more needs to be done, especially to ensure availability, fault-tolerance, confidentiality, and the integrity of the information system from applications to underlying infrastructure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A workshop on security, privacy, and trust was held in the fall of 2001 in Berkeley, CA. The purpose of the workshop was to bring together academic, industrial, and government experts in these areas to develop a research agenda and identify research areas that can make a major impact in the future. The workshop provided a report outlining a research agenda for trustworthiness and information security on the national scale.</AbstractNarration>
