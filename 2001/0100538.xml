    <AbstractNarration>Four projects on the mathematical theory of dynamical systems are&lt;br/&gt;proposed. Each project contains a cluster of problems with a common &lt;br/&gt;theme. The first pertains to strange attractors with strong dissipation &lt;br/&gt;and a single direction of instability. Extensions of a general theory &lt;br/&gt;developed under a previous grant to arbitrary phase-dimensions are &lt;br/&gt;proposed, as are applications to concrete problems such as nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;oscillators. The second project concerns the statistical behavior of &lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems with predominantly hyperbolic behavior. The focus of&lt;br/&gt;the proposed research is on mechanisms leading to various rates of &lt;br/&gt;correlation decay in both discrete and continuous times. The topic of &lt;br/&gt;the third project is lattice dynamical systems. A systematic analysis &lt;br/&gt;of the aggregate behavior of large numbers of dynamical systems coupled &lt;br/&gt;together is proposed. The final project proposes dynamical systems &lt;br/&gt;methods of solution for three unrelated problems on the Schrodinger &lt;br/&gt;operator, kinematic fast dynamo and Navier-Stokes equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a branch of mathematics, dynamical systems is concerned with &lt;br/&gt;the time evolutions of processes governed by certain underlying laws.&lt;br/&gt;A primary goal of the subject is to develop unifying mathematical&lt;br/&gt;theories to explain observed phenomena and predict future occurrences. &lt;br/&gt;In this proposal, the investigation of a number of models amenable to &lt;br/&gt;mathematical analysis and with potential applications to the physical &lt;br/&gt;and biological sciences is proposed. It has been known for some time &lt;br/&gt;that relatively simple laws can lead to complicated dynamics. The &lt;br/&gt;first part of this proposal focuses on systems with chaotic behavior. &lt;br/&gt;Two topics are proposed: an analysis of strange attractors and a &lt;br/&gt;statistical theory of mixing. (Strange attractors are highly complex &lt;br/&gt;objects which capture the long term behaviors of dissipative dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems; they have been observed frequently in nature and in simulations &lt;br/&gt;but have thus far resisted rigorous analysis.) Other projects proposed &lt;br/&gt;include the relations between aggregate properties of large dynamical &lt;br/&gt;systems and those of their individual components, and a few problems &lt;br/&gt;from physics and hydrodynamics which the principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;believes can be solved by the methods of dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;Four projects on the mathematical theory of dynamical systems are&lt;br/&gt;proposed.
