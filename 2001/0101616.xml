    <AbstractNarration>0101616&lt;br/&gt;Kimmerer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project supports sabbatical activities to initiate a new research direction and strengthen future research capability for Dr. Kimmerer. This project on the bryophytes of the Pacific Northwest complements and extends her expertise on Eastern mosses. These studies will 1) provide information to advance understanding of the reproductive ecology of common and rare bryophytes in coastal forests, 2) provide a framework for further studies of the population biology of epiphytic moss communities, and 3) have direct application to conservation in old growth forests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Western scientific knowledge of bryophytes in the Pacific Northwest is largely taxonomic in nature, with little data on population ecology or on moss response to anthropogenic disturbance. Until the harvest of bryophytes for floriculture began 20 years ago, bryophytes were not considered an exploitable resource and received little scientific attention. The reverse is true among the traditional native peoples of the region, for whom bryophytes have long been part of the indigenous subsistence economy. Both the history of intensive indigenous use, as well as cultural traditions that encourage close attention to biotic communities, suggest that there may be a significant body of traditional indigenous knowledge concerning bryophytes. Therefore, in parallel to the scientific investigations, I plan to evaluate the extent of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) concerning bryophyte response to a specific type of habitat alteration/disturbance, i.e., moss harvesting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of dual approaches of TEK and scientific tools is largely unknown in the academic community and support from the NSF-MCAA to explore feasibility is critical to development of this dualistic approach. I will use a full-year sabbatical leave to undertake field, laboratory and ethnographic research in collabroation with Dr. Bruce McCune and colleagues in Oregon State University (OSU)'s Department of Botany and Plant Pathology. OSU is also home to the Northwest Traditional Ecological Knowledge Institute, directed by Dr. Judith Vergun, who works extensively in ecological restoration with Native American tribes in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research involves three complementary scientific and TEK approaches to questions of moss conservation biology and the potential for sustainable use:&lt;br/&gt;1) Quantitative description of reproductive life histories of mosses designated as "survey and manage" species, versus attributes of a control group of ubiquitous species from similar habitats.&lt;br/&gt;2) Field and experimental assessments of dispersal and establishment success of "survey and manage" species subject to exploitation, versus success of the ubiquitous epiphytic species.&lt;br/&gt;3) Exploration of TEK levels held by local indigenous people that might be specific to the habitat requirements and post-harvest disturbance response of old-growth forest mosses and might offer insights into species biology and conservation.</AbstractNarration>
