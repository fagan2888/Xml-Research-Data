    <AbstractNarration>0110225&lt;br/&gt;Storm / Cava&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area. The 2001 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will be held at Queens College, Oxford, England September 16 - September 21, 2001. The goal of the conference is to facilitate international collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid state chemistry. The NSF funds will be used to support the attendance of young American Scientists as well as senior U.S. session chairs and invited speakers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Solid State Chemistry chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by designing new materials such as porous solids and molecular sieves, catalysts, and magnetic and electronic materials.</AbstractNarration>
