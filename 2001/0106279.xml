    <AbstractNarration>This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses the effect of steps on electrocatalysis and electrodeposition on platinum single crystal electrode surfaces. The electrooxidation of formic acid, and the deposition of Co/Pt magnetic multilayers form the main focus of this research carried out by Professor Hector D. Abruna at Cornell University. This work provides detailed insight into the relation between structure and function of electroactive metals in fuel cell and magnetic material applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detailed understanding of the connection between electrode surface structure and electrode chemical activity is the focus of this research project. Using well-characterized stepped single crystal electrodes, small organic molecule reactions are being examined. In addition, the use of these stepped surfaces as templates for the structured deposition of magnetic multilayers is explored in this work. The results of these studies will provide fundamental insight into the behavior of electrocatalytic systems.</AbstractNarration>
