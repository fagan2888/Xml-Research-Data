    <AbstractNarration>DMS Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award #: 0103907&lt;br/&gt;PI: Schleiniger, Gilberto&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;Program: Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Catherine Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: GOALI: Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of High Precision Sensors for Polymer Characterization&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project will address the mathematical modeling and analysis of piezoelectric transducers for polymer characterization. The principal investigator and a graduate student will work in cooperation with a researcher at DuPont to develop mathematical models and corresponding analytical and numerical tools to describe the response of thickness-shear mode resonators to contact with inhomogeneous viscoelastic media, a critical step in developing piezoelectric based transducers into operational chemical sensors. DuPont will participate in the development of the models by providing access to experimental facilities, data and involvement of the graduate student at the industrial site. The mathematical modeling is based on boundary-value problems for the linear and nonlinear systems of partial differential equations governing the physical processes at work in the sensor. Both perturbation and numerical methods will be used to obtain results, simplify the problem when appropriate, and to gain insight into special limiting cases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of low-cost, high performance sensing systems is of great interest both to research and commercial applications. Examples of areas that can benefit from such systems are processing waste material from mining and other industries which are of environmental concern, coating (e.g. in the automotive industry as well as in medical applications), packaging (e.g. food, medical) and pollution control sensors. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) research project will address the mathematical modeling and analysis of sensors for polymer characterization. The DuPont company will collaborate with the principal investigator and a graduate student to develop models for the improvement of these sensors. The project will benefit from this collaboration, including an industrial training opportunity for the mathematics graduate student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: June 4, 2001</AbstractNarration>
