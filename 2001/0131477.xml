    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this work is to use ordered molecular environments to control growth at a crystal surface. In biomineralization, nature uses a number of protein sequences to recognize specific crystal faces. To try to understand and model this process, functionalized gel matrices which present an array of carboxylates will first be used to control crystal growth. Functionalized bis urea gelators will first be used to study the effect of spatial group orientation on calcium carbonate crystal growth. Small constrained peptide sequences will then be synthesized (20 residues with 4 Asp or Glu residues and with and without internal lactam bridges) and their ability to interact with target minerals such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfide will be investigated. Second and third generation peptidomimetic molecules will then be designed to interact with specific crystal faces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Andrew D. Hamilton of the Department of Chemistry at Yale University. Dr. Hamilton will explore the basic chemical processes involved in the natural process of biomineralization. Designed organic molecules and specific protein sequences will be investigated for their ability to control the growth of minerals such as calcium carbonate and calcium sulfide. The ability to control calcium carbonate crystal growth has applications in biomedical science for controlled bone growth. The ability to control calcium sulfide growth has applications in the semiconductor industry. Students trained as a result of working on this project will gain experience in inorganic materials research as well as supramolecular organic chemistry, hence they will have skills needed by both the computer and pharmaceutical industries.</AbstractNarration>
