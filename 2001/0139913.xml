    <AbstractNarration>This research addresses a fundamental question regarding the nature of&lt;br/&gt;the charge structure of the neutron --- one of the basic building blocks&lt;br/&gt;of matter: What is the spatial distribution of the constituent quarks&lt;br/&gt;within the neutron, which has a net zero charge? This question was&lt;br/&gt;addressed in Jefferson Laboratory Experiment 93-038 by scattering&lt;br/&gt;longitudinally polarized electrons quasielastically from a neutron in&lt;br/&gt;deuterium. Deuterium consists of a neutron and a proton bound loosely&lt;br/&gt;together; it represents the best neutron target available. In a&lt;br/&gt;collision with the neutron, the electron transfers polarization to the&lt;br/&gt;neutron. Both components of the neutron polarization vector lie in the&lt;br/&gt;scattering plane: The transverse (or sideways) component is normal to&lt;br/&gt;the momentum of the neutron, and the longitudinal component is parallel&lt;br/&gt;(or antiparallel) to the neutron momentum. By measuring both the&lt;br/&gt;sideways and the longitudinal polarizations, it is possible to extract a&lt;br/&gt;quantity called the neutron electric form factor, which is designated by&lt;br/&gt;the letters GEN. Measurements of GEN as a function of momentum transfer&lt;br/&gt;are related to the spatial distribution of charge within the neutron.&lt;br/&gt;The uncertainty in our knowledge of the interior charge density of the&lt;br/&gt;neutron becomes smaller as measurements of GEN are extended to higher&lt;br/&gt;momentum transfer. Knowledge of GEN is essential to understanding the&lt;br/&gt;structure of matter. GEN is a fundamental quantity needed to challenge&lt;br/&gt;models of nucleon structure, to make detailed microscopic calculations&lt;br/&gt;of electric structure functions, and to interpret the results of&lt;br/&gt;parity-violating experiments. The current research involves carrying&lt;br/&gt;out and completing a detailed analysis of the data obtained from&lt;br/&gt;E93-038, preparing the results for publication, and preparing and&lt;br/&gt;carrying out a new experiment to extract GEN at still higher momentum&lt;br/&gt;transfers.</AbstractNarration>
