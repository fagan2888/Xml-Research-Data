    <AbstractNarration>This project aims at greater understanding of dislocations in GaN. The approach involves generation of dislocations with known Burgers vectors and known character, and the study of how these dislocations propagate during thin film growth. Additionally, the project addresses how dislocation propagation is influenced by orientation of the growth surface, particularly during lateral epitaxial overgrowth (LEO). Electrical and optical properties of these dislocations will also be examined. Specially designed grain boundaries will consist of ordered arrays of dislocations which are self-aligning and self-stabilizing. Variation of misorientation angle will be used to give control over dislocation spacing and character of the dislocations while variation of the boundary plane will be used for Burger vector control. Having many aligned dislocations in a single specimen gives the benefit of meaningful statistical analysis. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. These studies will improve the fundamental understanding of defects in Gallium Nitride, which is a key material to advanced microelectronics and photonics. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area, and education outreach activities to promote diversity. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
