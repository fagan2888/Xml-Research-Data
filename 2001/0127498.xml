    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Bioinformatics is central to biology in the 21st century. The use of computer based&lt;br/&gt;analytical tools on electronically stored and distributed data is fundamentally changing&lt;br/&gt;life science research and its application to problems in medicine, agriculture,&lt;br/&gt;conservation, and forensics. In light of this "information revolution" undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;biology curricula must be redesigned to prepare the next generation of informed citizens&lt;br/&gt;and prepare those who will pursue careers in the life sciences. The BEDROCK initiative&lt;br/&gt;(Bioinformatics Education Dissemination: Reaching Out, Connecting and Knitting-&lt;br/&gt;together) is enhancing, expanding, and empowering a national community of bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;educators. The project goals include: 1) Identify and support faculty who can take a&lt;br/&gt;leadership role in bioinformatics education; 2) Highlight and distribute innovative&lt;br/&gt;approaches to incorporating bioinformatics data and techniques throughout undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;biology education; and, 3) Establish mechanisms for the broad dissemination of&lt;br/&gt;bioinformatics resource materials and innovative teaching models. To achieve these goals&lt;br/&gt;we are holding a series of faculty development workshops around the country; recruiting&lt;br/&gt;and supporting a group of innovative faculty to implement and disseminate bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;education materials; publishing resources for bioinformatics education and building a&lt;br/&gt;networked collaboratory environment for developing and sharing bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;educational approaches. This project builds on the established pedagogical philosophy and&lt;br/&gt;academic community of the BioQUEST Curriculum Consortium. Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;BEDROCK extends our work in bioinformatics education over the last four years during&lt;br/&gt;which we have established a community of collaborators representing the diverse&lt;br/&gt;resources required to mount a national dissemination effort.</AbstractNarration>
