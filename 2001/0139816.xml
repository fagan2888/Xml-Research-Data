    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0139816&lt;br/&gt;Ted Chinburg&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of constructing infinitely many number fields of class&lt;br/&gt;number one descends from Gauss's work on quadratic forms, and remains&lt;br/&gt;one of the major unsolved problems in algebraic number theory. This&lt;br/&gt;has been the inspiration for many new ideas and techniques in&lt;br/&gt;algebraic number theory and arithmetic geometry. The proposers plan a&lt;br/&gt;sustained attack on this problem using geometric methods based upon&lt;br/&gt;recent advances in the theory of hyperbolic manifolds coupled with a&lt;br/&gt;natural broadening of the classical Bianchi- Hurwitz theorem.&lt;br/&gt;Possible important mathematical by-products include new techniques&lt;br/&gt;for estimating class numbers and an improvement of the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of properties of the trace fields of hyperbolic&lt;br/&gt;manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further consequences of this work of a somewhat broader impact also&lt;br/&gt;seem possible. The most obviously relevant applications seem to&lt;br/&gt;come from the direction of cryptography. The difficulty of factoring&lt;br/&gt;numbers into primes is the basis for the RSA cryptosystem. The fastest&lt;br/&gt;known algorithm for factoring large whole numbers into primes is the&lt;br/&gt;so-called number field sieve, and the techniques from algebraic number&lt;br/&gt;theory involved in this sieve were developed in part from work on class&lt;br/&gt;numbers. This project could impact such algorithms and progress on&lt;br/&gt;factoring problems would have significant implications for cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;This award is jointly funded by the programs in Topology and Algebra,&lt;br/&gt;Number Theory, &amp; Combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>
