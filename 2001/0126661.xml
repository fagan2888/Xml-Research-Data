    <AbstractNarration>Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;A stable isotope laboratory is being developed at Mount Holyoke College, adapted from similar efforts underway at Colgate University and Colorado College. The facility is designed for undergraduate student use in geoscience courses and stable isotope geochemistry is being integrated into the curriculum. The facility includes a vacuum line for the extraction of CO2 from carbonates and from combusted graphite/organic matter for analysis by mass spectrometry at nearby University of Massachusetts. A new stable isotope facility at the University of Massachusetts is also being used for analysis of water. Two- to four-week inquiry-based modules are being incorporated into several existing courses, and a new stable isotope course is being added to the departmental offerings. Impacted courses include environmental science, history of earth, petrology, groundwater, and the biosphere. Our goals are to enhance student comprehension of geochemical processes and critical thinking skills through active participation in real investigations. As an institution of higher learning for women, we hope to increase science literacy among those choosing non-science career paths, as well as improve the laboratory experiences for those who remain in science. Inquiry-based group projects are being used to promote teamwork, communication, excitement of discovery, and life-long learning skills. A variety of assessment tools are being used and significant results disseminated through publications in journals and presentations at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
