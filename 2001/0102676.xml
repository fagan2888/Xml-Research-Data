    <AbstractNarration>A majority of entering students begin their college careers with inadequate&lt;br/&gt;mathematics background to pursue SMET careers. The purpose of the proposed&lt;br/&gt;planning program is to design a comprehensive program to overcome these&lt;br/&gt;entering deficiencies to improve the participation and performance of minority&lt;br/&gt;students in SMET disciplines. The overall goals of the planning program will be&lt;br/&gt;(a) to assess the strengths, weaknesses and needs of mathematics instruction as&lt;br/&gt;well as other gate-keeping courses in the SMET disciplines; and (b) to assess &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate student research needs and opportunities in SMET disciplines on &lt;br/&gt;and off campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment includes, student performances on many items such as the Sophomore &lt;br/&gt;Proficiency Examination, Major Area Examinations, Graduate and Professional&lt;br/&gt;School Entrance Examinations, success in advanced programs, presentations of &lt;br/&gt;research papers at professional conferences, professional publications, and the &lt;br/&gt;type of employment and advancement in ranks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment of the quality of faculty members in the SMET disciplines will be done&lt;br/&gt;by a review of the credentials of faculty members as compared to the SMET faculty&lt;br/&gt;in other institutions and the standards set by accrediting bodies and performance &lt;br/&gt;portfolios. In assessing faculty development and recruitment needs, the ratio of &lt;br/&gt;instructor/students in mathematics and other SMET disciplines will be compared &lt;br/&gt;with other majors at Benedict, as well as with other similar institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Visitation to other institutions with SMET's curricula that have recently been &lt;br/&gt;reformed due to NSF effort, self-study or otherwise, will help Benedict to have&lt;br/&gt;a better assessment of the College's current SMET's curricula. This is also the case&lt;br/&gt;when selected staff members of the Task Force visit sites that they have recently &lt;br/&gt;reformed their SMET's curricula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current and future technology needs for SMET courses, in general, and SMET&lt;br/&gt;majors, in particular, will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consultants with expertise in SMET curricula will be used in the overall process of&lt;br/&gt;assessing the current curricula and potentially improving and/or redesigning them. &lt;br/&gt;It will be made certain that high-level decision-making administrators (President, &lt;br/&gt;his cabinet, and deans) review the comprehensive proposal and approve its contents &lt;br/&gt;before submission to NSF .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An internal advisory committee, (Task Force), will help to guide the work and to &lt;br/&gt;assess the planing program. In particular, this committee will help assess and analyze&lt;br/&gt; data and plan/design the curriculum for the comprehensive program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is anticipated that the proposed project will result in the development of a &lt;br/&gt;competitive proposal for submission to the National Science Foundation for funding &lt;br/&gt;through the HBCU-UP Program. The proposal will be based on an accurate assessment of&lt;br/&gt;current and future needs in the SMET programs at Benedict College. Results of these&lt;br/&gt;assessment activities will also provide information needed by the College to improve &lt;br/&gt;other areas that bear on the performance of students in the SMET disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
