    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II, project is aimed at the continued development and field testing of an autonomous robotic structural inspection system capable of remote powering and data collection from a network of embedded sensing nodes with remote data access via the internet. The system will utilize existing microminiature, multichannel, wireless, programmable Addressable Sensing Modules (ASM's) to sample data from a variety of sensors. These inductively powered nodes do not require batteries or interconnecting wires, which greatly enhances reliability and reduces installation cost. Networks of sensing nodes can be embedded, interrogated, and remotely accessed in applications where visual inspection by people is not practical due to: physical space constraints, remote geographic locations, high inspection costs, and high risks involved for those performing the inspections. The sensors can indicate the need for repair, replacement, or reinforcement, which will reduce the risk of catastrophic failure and will be useful after natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods. The availability of critical structural health data on the internet would greatly assist highway engineers and scientists to acquire information about these structures, which will improve our understanding of the safety of civil structures and their requisite maintenance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Market potential is significant, as various task specific robots can be employed (with our systems) for remote inspection and internet data delivery from a broad spectrum of structures, such as: bridges, bridge footings, dams, offshore oil rigs, buildings, hazardous waste sites, and nuclear power plants.&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is aimed at the continued development and field testing of an autonomous robotic structural inspection system capable of remote powering and data collection from a network of embedded sensing nodes with remote data access via the internet.
