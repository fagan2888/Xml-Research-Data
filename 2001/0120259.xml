    <AbstractNarration>The Wildlands Project is producing a four-hour television series for PBS and the CBC. The television series, "The Sacred Balance," will feature geneticist and environmental scientist David Suzuki as he examines a new vision of the human place in nature. The series aims to enrich and expand the scientific world view by looking at traditional knowledge, myth, literature and art, and by incorporating aspects of human spirituality into the insights presented by science. The aim of the project is to show that the world-view human beings have celebrated since ancient times is reemerging, transformed, from the laboratories of modern science. Moving away from reductionist techniques, researchers from many different disciplines are studying diversity, whole organisms, systems and relationships that begin in the individual cell and extend to the entire planet. The television series is designed to change the way the public acts in the world by demonstrating that what we do to the Earth we do to ourselves. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Suzuki will work closely with an advisory committee in shaping the series. The members of this committee include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lane Lubchenco: Professor of Marine Biology and Zoology, Oregon State University&lt;br/&gt;David Schindler: Environmental Ecologist, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Alberta&lt;br/&gt;E. O. Wilson: Biologist, Harvard University&lt;br/&gt;Sylvia Earl: Marine Ecologist and "Explorer in Residence" at the National Geographic Society, Washington, DC&lt;br/&gt;James Parks Morton: Former Dean, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, currently at the Interfaith Center of New York&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The television series will be supplemented by a new, interactive Sacred Balance website and a teachers guide. Ancillary material also will include Dr. Suzuki's trade book, "The Sacred Balance."</AbstractNarration>
