    <AbstractNarration>The proposed integrated research and education program focusses on&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the notorious polarization instability and sensitivity&lt;br/&gt;to optical feedback of single transverse mode vertical cavity surface&lt;br/&gt;emitting lasers (VCSELs). These intertwined difficulties plague ongoing&lt;br/&gt;efforts to develop the use of single mode VCSELs for applications such&lt;br/&gt;as wavelength division multiplexed communications networks and optical&lt;br/&gt;disk readout. Furthermore, we expect that our work will be relevant to&lt;br/&gt;future investigations of other low-dimensional semiconductor nano-lasers&lt;br/&gt;with a large degree of symmetry. The experimental investigations of&lt;br/&gt;polarization stability will be analyzed using a novel model that we have&lt;br/&gt;developed to describe VCSELs with two polarization eigenstates in the&lt;br/&gt;presence of optical feedback. This CW work will then be extended to an&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the small-signal modulation response of VCSELs with&lt;br/&gt;optical feedback. Finally, the results of these investigations will be&lt;br/&gt;used to explore practical strategies for improving the stability and&lt;br/&gt;polarization control of single mode VCSELs exposed to optical feedback.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be integrated into the education of our&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate physics and engineering majors, both in the classroom and&lt;br/&gt;via direct participation of undergraduates in my research program. In&lt;br/&gt;order to enable our students to acquire the necessary research skills,&lt;br/&gt;we are developing a new investigative, inquiry-driven, sophomore-level&lt;br/&gt;instructional optoelectronics lab. In addition, we are introducing into&lt;br/&gt;our introductory sequence pedagogical reforms aimed at encouraging&lt;br/&gt;students to engage in the processes of critical analysis that are&lt;br/&gt;essential to successful, creative research. Ultimately, this&lt;br/&gt;integration of research and teaching will contribute to the resolution&lt;br/&gt;of a critical problem in VCSEL development while preparing our&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to join the ranks of the next generation of women&lt;br/&gt;scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
