    <AbstractNarration>Terman&lt;br/&gt;0103822&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleague develop geometric,&lt;br/&gt;dynamical systems tools for analyzing biophysical,&lt;br/&gt;conductance-based models for a broad class of neuronal networks.&lt;br/&gt;These systems arise in numerous applications including motor&lt;br/&gt;activity, sensory processing and learning. They also develop&lt;br/&gt;computational models for the generation of sleep rhythms,&lt;br/&gt;epilepsy and parkinsonian tremor. The investigators also&lt;br/&gt;construct and refine a mathematical and computational model for&lt;br/&gt;electrical activity in the subthalamic nucleus and external&lt;br/&gt;segment of the globus pallidus. These are two nuclei in the&lt;br/&gt;basal ganglia, a part of the brain involved in motor activity.&lt;br/&gt;Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated with movement&lt;br/&gt;disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.&lt;br/&gt;The model is used to test hypotheses on the role of the basal&lt;br/&gt;ganglia in both normal and pathological movement. Numerous&lt;br/&gt;experiments have demonstrated that neurons within the basal&lt;br/&gt;ganglia display a rich variety of dynamic behavior; moreover,&lt;br/&gt;patterns of neuronal activity, both spatial and temporal, are&lt;br/&gt;different between a normal and a pathological state. The&lt;br/&gt;investigators characterize the possible patterns of neuronal&lt;br/&gt;activity that arise in the model and determine how these patterns&lt;br/&gt;change with respect to modulations of network parameters and&lt;br/&gt;structure. A long term goal is to develop a model realistic&lt;br/&gt;enough so that it can shed light upon the key parameters and&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms responsible for the generation and modulation of&lt;br/&gt;observed activity patterns.&lt;br/&gt; A mathematical theory for the analysis of neuronal dynamics&lt;br/&gt;helps illuminate the role played by various components of a model&lt;br/&gt;in generating a particular population rhythm. These components&lt;br/&gt;may correspond to some intrinsic property of individual cells, or&lt;br/&gt;to some network property such as the strength and type of&lt;br/&gt;synaptic coupling or the probability that two cells communicate&lt;br/&gt;with each other. Clarification of the mechanisms underlying&lt;br/&gt;different activity patterns may lead to a classification of all&lt;br/&gt;possible rhythms that can emerge from a given network, and enable&lt;br/&gt;us to determine how complicated a model should be in order to&lt;br/&gt;display some observed behavior. It also helps predict&lt;br/&gt;transitions of the network behavior as parameters in the model&lt;br/&gt;are varied. The investigators develop models for neuronal&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, and in particular of electrical activity in the&lt;br/&gt;subthalamic nucleus and external segment of the globus pallidus.&lt;br/&gt;These are two nuclei in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain&lt;br/&gt;involved in motor activity. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is&lt;br/&gt;associated with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease&lt;br/&gt;and Huntington's disease. The model is used to test hypotheses&lt;br/&gt;on the role of the basal ganglia in both normal and pathological&lt;br/&gt;movement. Such models may help illuminate both fundamental&lt;br/&gt;neuroscience questions and clinical issues about how the brain&lt;br/&gt;and central nervous system work.</AbstractNarration>
