    <AbstractNarration>Designing Embedded Systems with Domain-Specific Languages&lt;br/&gt;Stephen A. Edwards&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This goal of this project is to provide tools to designers of embedded&lt;br/&gt;systems that will allow them to more quickly create correct systems.&lt;br/&gt;It proposes to do this by providing domain-specific languages and&lt;br/&gt;compilers. Such succinct, abstract languages reduce development and&lt;br/&gt;testing time by providing more formal, correct-by-construction&lt;br/&gt;methodologies and by enabling automatic implementation techniques.&lt;br/&gt;The result will enable the development of these systems to proceed&lt;br/&gt;beyond the current ad hoc C-and-assembly approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses three issues in the design of many embedded&lt;br/&gt;systems: real-time software, software for communication, and software&lt;br/&gt;for communicating across the hardware/software boundary.&lt;br/&gt;These issues are addressed through the following specific investigations:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Compilation Techniques for Synchronous Languages&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Synchronous languages such as Esterel provide very predictable&lt;br/&gt;real-time behavior but are challenging to compile. This project&lt;br/&gt;includes developing new, more efficient compilation techniques for&lt;br/&gt;large systems described in the Esterel language and its variants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Languages and Compilers for Communication Protocols&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network communication is becoming a crucial part of every embedded&lt;br/&gt;system, but the growing complexity of the protocols and the need for&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth (e.g., for video) makes this software difficult to develop.&lt;br/&gt;This project includes the development of a new language for&lt;br/&gt;describing such protocol software and a compiler for producing&lt;br/&gt;efficient implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New Languages and Compilers for Device Drivers&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Writing software that communicates directly with hardware is currently&lt;br/&gt;tedious and error-prone, and unfortunately even more important in&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems since they tend to have application-specific&lt;br/&gt;peripherals. This project aims to simplify this task by creating a&lt;br/&gt;language and compiler for writing device drivers. The results of this &lt;br/&gt;research will enable more diverse languages for communicating across &lt;br/&gt;the hardware/software boundary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also addressing the recurring complaint that academia&lt;br/&gt;does not produce students who understand both hardware and software&lt;br/&gt;well enough to be effective embedded systems designers by developing&lt;br/&gt;new courses along these lines. At the undergraduate level, a new&lt;br/&gt;embedded systems project course is being developed that will give&lt;br/&gt;students the opportunity to learn about and use some of these new&lt;br/&gt;techniques. At the graduate level, a more sophisticated course is&lt;br/&gt;being developed that focuses on languages for describing embedded&lt;br/&gt;systems and isses with their semantics and implementation. This will&lt;br/&gt;give future designers more tools for developing embedded systems and&lt;br/&gt;will prepare students for research in automating embedded system&lt;br/&gt;design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this project are being disseminated in three ways:&lt;br/&gt;through conference and journal papers, through the release of all&lt;br/&gt;developed software to the public domain, and through the education of&lt;br/&gt;students in the use of the languages and compilers developed. Just as&lt;br/&gt;computer-aided design tools have enabled the rapid, correct design of&lt;br/&gt;fantastically complex integrated circuits, this work is enabling the&lt;br/&gt;quick, correct design of tomorrow's complex embedded systems.</AbstractNarration>
