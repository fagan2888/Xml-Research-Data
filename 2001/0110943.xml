    <AbstractNarration>Asparagine synthetase is the enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the amino&lt;br/&gt;acid Asparagine, an important component of proteins in all organisms. This enzyme has&lt;br/&gt;been isolated and studied from a variety of sources, and recently the crystal structure of&lt;br/&gt;the bacterial form of the enzyme has been elucidated. The crystal structure illustrated&lt;br/&gt;that there was a channel that kept one of the highly reactive intermediates of the reaction&lt;br/&gt;from interacting and becoming inactive through reaction with water in the solvent. This&lt;br/&gt;mode of protecting enzyme intermediates from solvent inactivation has been reported for&lt;br/&gt;other cases over the last decade. In none of these cases, however, has the mechanism of&lt;br/&gt;the transport been elucidated. This project will utilize bacterial Asparagine Synthetase as&lt;br/&gt;a model for reactive intermediate transport. It involves an experimental approach to&lt;br/&gt;describe the components of the transport process. Elucidating the chemical components&lt;br/&gt;required for the channeling of intermediates will enable researchers to understand the&lt;br/&gt;chemistry of transport and to allow for design of novel coupled enzyme activities.</AbstractNarration>
