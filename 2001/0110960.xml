    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Charles Winter (PI) of the Department of Chemistry, Wayne State University, and Dr. Judith Stein (co-PI) are supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, to host the 2001, 2002 and 2003 NSF-sponsored Annual Inorganic Workshops. The purpose of these workshops is to assemble researchers from different geographical areas and broad diversity at different stages of their careers to encourage informal and detailed discussion of in progress investigations. The workshops will focus on emerging ideas, new techniques, and unsolved problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will bring together inorganic chemists, particularly the younger chemists at the Assistant and Associate Professor levels to give them an occasion to "test" their ideas on more senior chemists. An annual report will be made available to the NSF IBO program and to the community based on input from the participants on the "status of inorganic chemistry research" to provide NSF and the responsible program with insight into emerging research areas.</AbstractNarration>
