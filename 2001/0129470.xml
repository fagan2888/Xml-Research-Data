    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Alexander Kiselev&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: DMS-0129470&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Chicago&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus mainly on two directions.&lt;br/&gt;The first objective is to further study and apply to concrete&lt;br/&gt;quantum systems of interest the criteria relating behavior&lt;br/&gt;of solutions of Schroedinger equation, spectrum and dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the applications may shed new light on the &lt;br/&gt;dynamics and spectrum of certain classes of random and &lt;br/&gt;quasiperiodic operators, such as Fibonacci Hamiltonian, as &lt;br/&gt;well as provide a better general understanding of the quantum &lt;br/&gt;transport phenomena. The second objective is to continue the &lt;br/&gt;study of advanced WKB methods for one-dimensional Schroedinger &lt;br/&gt;operators, using the tools of harmonic analysis. WKB methods &lt;br/&gt;are a classical part of quantum mechanics, and their main &lt;br/&gt;goal is to find a good approximation for the wave function of &lt;br/&gt;the system under certain natural assumptions. This project will &lt;br/&gt;pursue the development of new WKB-type techniques, which can be &lt;br/&gt;applied to obtain information about dynamics of a class of &lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger operators. Extensions to higher dimensions &lt;br/&gt;will also be sought. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger operators &lt;br/&gt;is the cornerstone of Quantum Mechanics. This theory describes &lt;br/&gt;the laws which govern behavior of the quantum particles, such &lt;br/&gt;as electrons, atoms and molecules. Much of the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;scientific knowledge about many important physical processes &lt;br/&gt;(such as, for example, chemical reactions or conduction &lt;br/&gt;properties of various materials) comes from the theory of &lt;br/&gt;Schroedinger operators. This project focuses on the development &lt;br/&gt;of new methods in spectral and dynamical theory of Schroedinger &lt;br/&gt;operators which may allow a new approach to some long-standing &lt;br/&gt;problems in Quantum Mechanics. These problems concern, in &lt;br/&gt;particular, the conductance properties of materials with &lt;br/&gt;impurities and of quasicrystals, and have direct applications &lt;br/&gt;to modern engineering devices, wave guides and transistors to &lt;br/&gt;name two. The project will also involve development of a modern&lt;br/&gt;mathematical methods curriculum for undergraduate students &lt;br/&gt;majoring in biology and chemistry. Given rapidly evolving &lt;br/&gt;interface between mathematics and these sciences, a new set &lt;br/&gt;of ideas and material needs to be incorporated into such &lt;br/&gt;service courses. In addition, graduate courses will be &lt;br/&gt;developed with the main objective to help beginning graduate&lt;br/&gt;students make a transition to independent research.</AbstractNarration>
