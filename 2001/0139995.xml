    <AbstractNarration>Cold atom interactions and dilute Fermi degenerate atomic gases have become very dynamic areas of research. One of the most intriguing new frontiers is the creation of quantum degenerate dipolar fermionic gases. Such gases are predicted to exhibit exciting new phenomena including dipole-induced mean field effects and, perhaps, BCS superfluidity. Ultracold dipolar gases could also play a role in the construction of a robust quantum computer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dilute Fermi degenerate atomic gases have numerous features that need to be explored. Similar to their charged particle counterparts (electrons), their behavior in the condensed state will be varied and depend crucially on the subtleties of their interactions. Very little is known about ultracold dipolar Fermi systems. One promising route to the study of such systems is through evaporative and sympathetic cooling of magnetically trapped atomic gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this research proposal is to investigate the magnetic trapping and evaporative cooling of Fermionic atoms, the interactions between cold and ultracold atoms, and the possible creation of atomic Fermi degenerate gases with high magnetic moment. This will be accomplished using magnetically trapped metal atoms (such as chromium). Spectroscopy will be used for detection of the trapped species. Precise determination of elastic and inelastic collisional cross sections will provide important information about these systems. Fermi degeneracy will be pursued through a combination of laser cooling and evaporative cooling of magnetically trapped co-resident bosonic and fermionic isotopes.</AbstractNarration>
