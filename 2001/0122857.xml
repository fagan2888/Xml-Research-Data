    <AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. William H. Isbell, Mr. Rodrigo Nararrete will &lt;br/&gt;conduct archaeological and ethnohistorical research in Venezuela, collecting &lt;br/&gt;data for his doctoral dissertation. His primary objective is to gain a &lt;br/&gt;better understanding of the nature and development of complex human &lt;br/&gt;societies, focusing on a perplexing Native American example. Cultures of the &lt;br/&gt;Caribbean region have long been recognized as superb examples of what &lt;br/&gt;anthropologists call "chiefdoms," political systems intermediate between &lt;br/&gt;simple bands or tribes, and complex state governments. Indeed, it is &lt;br/&gt;believed that the "chiefdom" represents humanity's first experiment with &lt;br/&gt;complex social organization. Consequently, if we are to understand the &lt;br/&gt;evolution of social complexity, chiefdoms must be studied and comprehended, &lt;br/&gt;and the Caribbean offers an exceptional laboratory using archaeology and &lt;br/&gt;ethnohistory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Venezuela's Unare River Basin is an important area that probably provided an &lt;br/&gt;avenue of migration between riverine Amazonian lowlands and the Caribbean &lt;br/&gt;Coast. It could shed light on debates about differences in social complexity &lt;br/&gt;between the Amazonian and the Caribbean culture areas, but early descriptions &lt;br/&gt;of the cultures occupying Venezuela's Unare River are curiously &lt;br/&gt;contradictory. Sixteenth and early seventeenth century chroniclers describe &lt;br/&gt;complex Carib societies. But eighteenth century chronicles describe only &lt;br/&gt;simple cultures like the Cariban Karinas. How is this to be understood? &lt;br/&gt;Should these descriptions be considered historically accurate, fostering &lt;br/&gt;questions about the conditions in which societies experience cultural &lt;br/&gt;collapse. Alternatively, do these descriptions reflect changes in the way &lt;br/&gt;Europeans viewed and described the "other," as well, perhaps, as changes in &lt;br/&gt;the political goals that colored European perceptions and accounts?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The way to definitively resolve this is to compare ethnohistorical accounts &lt;br/&gt;with archaeological information. Navarrete has completed a study of the &lt;br/&gt;chronicles. Funded by NSF he will conduct the first systematic &lt;br/&gt;archaeological survey in the Unare Depression, employing a &lt;br/&gt;transects-and-shovel-test-pits strategy appropriate for heavily vegetated &lt;br/&gt;environment. The survey is designed to reveal material correlates of social &lt;br/&gt;complexity as well as materials correlates of cultural simplification. The &lt;br/&gt;results will reveal the history of social complexity in the Unare Basin, and &lt;br/&gt;their implications for the ways changes in European philosophy and politics &lt;br/&gt;influenced conceptualizations of natives and their social conditions. The &lt;br/&gt;dissertation will also establish valuable foundations for more comprehensive &lt;br/&gt;archaeological investigations of the Venezuelan past.</AbstractNarration>
