    <AbstractNarration>This Scalable Enterprise Systems Phase II project effort will build upon the work in Phase I by: (1) extending the relational decision framework to support efficient integration of distributed heterogeneous databases into a global decision framework; (2) building on the theory of co-evolutionary search algorithms using intelligent agents to address issues in multi-criteria decision-making; and (3) developing a comprehensive model of dynamic decision networks, integrating characteristics of software algorithms and network hardware and software for communications in order to evaluate performance and guide system design. Advances in information technologies are driving fundamental changes in the processes and organizations of global enterprises. Innovations in software, networks, and database systems enable widely distributed organizations to integrate activities, share information, collaborate on decisions, and execute transactions. While many existing tools and techniques of information infrastructure may be adopted and implemented to support these enterprise applications, there has been little focused research to provide a scientific basis to support these developments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major outcome of this research will be an integrated demonstration of network-based distributed decision methods applied to real industrial problems and evaluated through sophisticate evaluation and simulation methods. The outcomes of this work offer advantages of local autonomy, reliability, improved performance, scalability, shareability, data confidentiality, and efficient software support for a new class of enterprise-level software systems. This research project includes efforts to incorporate these ideas into existing and new educational programs and courses with special attention to the recruiting and retention of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
