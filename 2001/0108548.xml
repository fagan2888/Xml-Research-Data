    <AbstractNarration>The main objective of this project is to organize UNIF 2001,&lt;br/&gt;the 15th International Workshop on Unification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unification is concerned with the problem of identifying given &lt;br/&gt;terms, either syntactically or modulo a given logical theory. &lt;br/&gt;Syntactic unification is the basic operation of most automated &lt;br/&gt;reasoning systems, and unification modulo theories can be used,&lt;br/&gt;for instance, to build in special equational theories into &lt;br/&gt;theorem provers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UNIF 2001 will be the latest in a series of annual international&lt;br/&gt;workshops on unification, the previous ones having been mostly in &lt;br/&gt;Europe (France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and twice in the US.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of UNIF 2001, as that of the previous meetings, is to &lt;br/&gt;bring together people interested in unification, present recent &lt;br/&gt;(even unfinished) work, and discuss new ideas and trends in &lt;br/&gt;unification and related fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, it is intended to offer a good opportunity for &lt;br/&gt;young researchers and researchers working in related areas to get &lt;br/&gt;an overview of the current state of the art in unification theory&lt;br/&gt;and get in contact with the experts in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to researchers from automated reasoning and term &lt;br/&gt;rewriting, the traditional participants to UNIF, this year's &lt;br/&gt;workshop will try to attract also researchers from theoretical &lt;br/&gt;computer science working on unification algorithms for special &lt;br/&gt;theories (such as associativity) where astonishing progress has &lt;br/&gt;been achieved in the last two years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will also try to facilitate, with travel awards and &lt;br/&gt;registration fee waivers, the participation of young researchers &lt;br/&gt;from the United States. The intent of this is to stimulate research&lt;br/&gt;on unification in this country, as well as alert US researchers &lt;br/&gt;working in automated reasoning and verification to recent results &lt;br/&gt;in this field.</AbstractNarration>
