    <AbstractNarration>This research takes a significant step towards enabling and evaluating the application of compiler&lt;br/&gt;optimizations for uniprocessor performance within explicitly parallel programs, with a flexible view&lt;br/&gt;of memory consistency. Two important unanswered questions are targeted: &lt;br/&gt;(1) What kind of performance can be gained with the Location Consistency (LC) memory model in comparison&lt;br/&gt;to the sequential consistency (SC)-derived models for shared memory parallel programs,&lt;br/&gt;amidst the new developments of compiler analysis and optimization for SC-derived models?&lt;br/&gt;(2) As a compromise between the two divergent approaches, can both the SC-derived models and the LC model be supported within the same program, by developing a programmer-controlled memory consistency strategy&lt;br/&gt;supported by compiler technology?&lt;br/&gt;The results&lt;br/&gt;will include:&lt;br/&gt;(1) specification and implemenation of a programming model that assumes an end-to-end view of the memory system based on the LC model, and a study of its programmability,&lt;br/&gt;(2) compilation analyses to uphold programmer-controlled memory consistency so programmers can choose between the memory models in different parts of the same application,&lt;br/&gt;(3) development and refinement of cache consistency protocols based on the LC model in a software caching context,&lt;br/&gt;(4) experimental evaluation of compiler optimization and program performance under&lt;br/&gt;different memory consistency models and cache protocols.</AbstractNarration>
