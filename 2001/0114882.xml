    <AbstractNarration>The Meteorology Department and Science Education program of Florida State &lt;br/&gt;University, in collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration &lt;br/&gt;(NOAA), will carry out a school-site meteorological project to be located in Miami/Dade &lt;br/&gt;County Public Schools. This new collaborative project is entitled Middle School &lt;br/&gt;Students' REALM (Really Exploring And Learning Meteorology). The project's foci &lt;br/&gt;are: (1) to expose more middle school girls to meteorological science content, (2) to &lt;br/&gt;develop a positive and supportive learning environment for participating girls and boys, &lt;br/&gt;(3) to provide on site technical assistance to participating science teachers for content &lt;br/&gt;implementation, and (4) to provide a vehicle for greater parent-girl participation in &lt;br/&gt;science activities. In order to maximize resources, available &lt;br/&gt;meteorology resources (weather stations) that are in demographically dispersed middle &lt;br/&gt;schools will be used. Involvement in this project will enhance girls' awareness of career opportunities &lt;br/&gt;for women in the field of science in general and meteorology in particular. This project &lt;br/&gt;will also increase middle school girls' self-esteem and confidence in learning science &lt;br/&gt;concepts, which integrate the use of mathematics and technology. This project model &lt;br/&gt;aims to reduce the attrition in advanced level science, mathematics and technology &lt;br/&gt;coursework that typically occurs as girls move from middle school to high school, &lt;br/&gt;which carries over into higher education.</AbstractNarration>
