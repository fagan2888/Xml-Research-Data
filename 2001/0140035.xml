    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Seventh US National Congress on Computational Mechanics&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Albuquerque Convention Center&lt;br/&gt;Albuquerque, New Mexico, &lt;br/&gt;August 4-6, 2003&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. Association for Computational Mechanics, USACM, has asked a group of scientists from academia and government to organize the 7th National Congress on Computational Mechanics, to take place in the Albuquerque Convention Center, August 4-6, 2003. The Albuquerque meeting will occur at a time of increasing interest in computational mechanics, spurred by innovative approaches in materials engineering, nanotechnology, biology and medical science and by the availability of powerful new parallel and distributed computing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biannual Congresses of the U.S. Association for Computational Mechanics are major scientific events that attract an international audience. The seventh U.S. Congress, hosted by Sandia National Laboratories, will highlight the latest developments in all aspects of computational mechanics - from new applications in nanotechnology and bioengineering to recent advances in numerical methods and high-performance computing. The technical program features invited plenary lectures by distinguished experts as well as minisymposia that focus on topics of current scientific interest. Participants will have a special opportunity to experience the unique scientific environment of Sandia National Laboratories through interactions with research staff and to envision its future in initiatives such as the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) and the Microsystems and Engineering Sciences Applications Complex (MESA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 7th Congress will be the first where a National Laboratory is taking the lead organizational role. Dr. Bickel, director of the Engineering Sciences Center of Sandia National Laboratories, and Professor Fish, vice-president of USACM, will be the Congress general co-chairs. Dr. Bickel will exploit Sandia's many contacts in industry, academia, and government in planning and promoting the conference. Sandia will also provide administrative support, drawing on its extensive experience in planning scientific events. Dr. Christon from Sandia and Professor Haber from the University of Illinois will co-chair the technical program. The Local Organizing Committee is comprised of Tom Bickel, Mark Christon, Jacob Fish (RPI) and Robert Haber (University of Illinois). The Congress organizers are working closely with the Executive Committee of USACM, which is currently composed of twenty distinguished computational mechanicians, including the past presidents Ted Belytschko, Thomas Hughes, Tinsley Oden, Ahmed Noor, J.N. Reddy and Mark Shephard. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our main objective is to bring together the diverse communities that are active in computational mechanics and to promote interactions between government, academia and industry. We will make a concentrated effort to attract new participants from consulting engineering firms and from key computer and software companies, while retaining the Congress's core constituency of scientists from academia and government laboratories. We also plan to support the participation of young researchers, especially graduate students, affording them a unique opportunity to disseminate their research results, to contact potential employers, and to learn about the latest advances in this rapidly developing field. Complete information about the meeting is available at the Congress web &lt;http://www.esc.sandia.gov/usnccm.html&gt;.</AbstractNarration>
