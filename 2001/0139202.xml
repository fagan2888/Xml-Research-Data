    <AbstractNarration>The REU program conducted by the Rice Quantum Institute brings together a number of students from outside universities as well as from Rice University for a ten-week interdisciplinary summer research program. The focus is to provide undergraduate students, frequently from schools with more limited resources, with a jump start into many aspects of research that cannot easily be learned in classes. The students are exposed to different disciplines by contact with a variety of research groups, organized lab tours, weekly seminars by Rice grad students, and frequent scientific and social interactions with other REU students. Each student also works on a project with a particular research group from among the departments of Physics and Astronomy, Chemistry, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science, Bioengineering, Chemical Engineering, Computational and Applied Mathematics, and Civil and Environmental Engineering. This involves an accelerated learning period where students become familiar with a new field and depend on the undergrads, grads, postdocs and faculty mentor of the group to show them the relevant literature, lab expertise, instrument and computer skills, etc. This leads into the major period of research where they are given the responsibility for bringing the project to a successful completion. Participants are given an opportunity to to present their work on the last day at the RQI Colloquium. This annual event, which assembles a large audience made up of REU students, of research groups and others from Rice, as well as interested outsiders from neighboring schools and industries, showcases research going on within the Institute.</AbstractNarration>
