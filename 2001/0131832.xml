    <AbstractNarration>This award by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Malcolm H. Chisholm at the Ohio State University to investigate two aspects of the dinuclear chemistry of molybdenum and tungsten: 1) The activation of multiple bonds in nitriles, alkynes and dinitrogen in their reactions with compounds having M-M multiple bonds, and 2) The preparation and characterization of linked dimers of dimers, cyclotetramers and mesogens containing M-M multiple bonds. Particular emphasis is given to establishing the kinetic and thermodynamic factors that control the metathesis reactions in which multiple bonds are exchanged between dinuclear complexes and those in nitriles, alkynes and dinitrogen. In the second project specific attention is given to dinuclear compounds with bridging carboxylate linkers. Single electron oxidized and reduced species will be prepared and examined by epr spectroscopy to evaluate the electron delocalization. The thermotropic mesophases of the dinuclear complexes doped with paramagnetic complexes will be studied by magnetic resonance in order to establish the alignment of the columnar phase and he localization or delocalization of the paramagnetic site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complexes with two metal atoms will be investigated for their reactivity with small molecules with multiple bonds and for their ability to form novel supramolecules and materials.</AbstractNarration>
