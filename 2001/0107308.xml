    <AbstractNarration>07308&lt;br/&gt;Drury&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a twenty-four month postdoctoral research fellowship by Dr. William J. Drury III to work with Dr. Dr. Andreas Pfaltz at the University of Basel in Switzerland.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is the development and application of new homogenous, asymmetric transition metal catalysts. The design of the proposed metal ligands is based upon an attempt to convert well-known, highly active, achiral catalysts into new chiral catalysts. The complexes will be tested in familiar arenas for both asymmetric induction, as well as catalytic efficiency. Once this has been assessed, the complexes will be used to develop new methodology. I have identified two classes of compounds for which no asymmetric route exists. The use of the rationally designed catalysts in asymmetric hydrogenation gives rapid entry into these compounds that include highly pharmacologically active 1-phenyl-2-aminopropane derivatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Pfaltz is a world leader in the field of asymmetric catalysis. The University, as well as Dr. Pfaltz have close contacts with international corporations such as Novartis and Fluka, centered in Basel.</AbstractNarration>
