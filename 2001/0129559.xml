    <AbstractNarration>This workshop uses recognized experts in information technologies to improve our understanding of the appropriate use of information technology in sustainable development. We intend to look particularly closely at remote environments recently affected by conflict and natural disasters. Attention will be directed toward methods of collecting and relaying information between a remote local population and their environment, and we intend to evaluate both the methods and metrics of collection and the capability for remote, high-dimensional visualization of those complex local systems. The hypothesis is that collecting health information locally with the capability of remote visualization can offer a quantitative and predictive method for community analysis. With careful attention to design, and iterative feedback for the community, we expect to offer earlier recognition of a spectrum of possible threats. Information collected, analyzed, and iterated may improve health while guiding local development sustainability, thereby improving regional stability. Better understanding the ecology and epidemiology of locations distant in geography and in culture broadens our global insight and benefits national security.</AbstractNarration>
