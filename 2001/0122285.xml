    <AbstractNarration>The SCRSI is an outshoot of the UCAN-RSI. Unsuccessfully attempted as an implementation award last year, it has been redesigned and reconsidered as a developmental. Anchored at Adams State College in rural Southern Colorado, the SCRSI plans to improve science, mathematics and technology education through a partnership of 18 school districts, two Boards of Cooperative Educational Service Centers (BOCES), two Regional Assistance Centers (RAC) 2 junior colleges and 2 four-year colleges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The school districts encompass 47 K-12 schools in an economically disadvantaged area with approximately 12,000 students. Over 75% of the students in the schools are Hispanic. The 47 schools are members of three coalitions, the San Luis Valley, the Arkansas Valley and the South Central Coalitions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are four major components to the SCRSI:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Creation of an infrastructure for managing the project and completing the scope-of-work throughout the established consortium. &lt;br/&gt;Action: Establish site-based leadership teams, Coalition leadership teams and project leadership teams.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Completion of a site analysis of individual schools to identify strengths and weaknesses in order to direct future implementation strategies.&lt;br/&gt;Action: Complete matrices on full implementation and assessment at each school, conduct teacher surveys and school walk-throughs, compile and analyze student data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Establishment of strong collaboration across schools, partnerships and networks across all levels of the region.&lt;br/&gt;Action: Conduct team meetings and three strategic planning meetings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Development of the implementation plan supported by all partners including specific partnership commitments.&lt;br/&gt;Action: Submit a report and propose an implementation plan.</AbstractNarration>
