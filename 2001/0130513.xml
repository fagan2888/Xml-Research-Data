    <AbstractNarration>As we approach 100nm technology, the impact of interconnect on signal integrity is becoming one of the main concerns in testing gigahertz system-on-chips (SoCs). Voltage distortion (noise) and delay violations (skew) contribute to signal integrity loss and ultimately functional error, performance degradation, shorter life and reliability problems. This research investigates a methodology to model and test signal integrity in deep-submicron high-speed interconnects that bind the internal cores in a SoC. The following issues are being explored: a) the development of a unified integrity fault model, independent of technology, that includes various problems occurring on the SoC's high-speed interconnects such as crosstalk, overshoot, skew, etc.; b) the establishment of a test generation technique that finds test patterns to stimulate maximal (worst case) integrity loss on the interconnect network; c) the implementation of noise detector (ND) and skew detector (SD) cells, to detect noise and skew violations (integrity loss) over a period of operation; and d) the design of a cost- and time-efficient readout architecture to transfer the integrity information that ND and SD cells accumulate. As part of educational plan, we are: 1) developing a two course sequence on ASIC/SoC design and test with emphasis on high-frequency issues; 2) involving undergraduate students in general, and minorities in particular, in VLSI/ASIC/SOC test research. 3) advocating for greater CAD tool use in early stage of CE/EE curriculum.</AbstractNarration>
