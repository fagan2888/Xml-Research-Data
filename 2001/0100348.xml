    <AbstractNarration>The Indiana nuclear physics group plans to assume a leading role in the&lt;br/&gt;investigation of the following critical questions in nuclear physics.&lt;br/&gt;The spin of the proton is an essential property that determines the&lt;br/&gt;structure of matter, yet we know that only a small part of the spin&lt;br/&gt;comes from the three quarks that form the proton. The STAR-SPIN group&lt;br/&gt;would definitively measure the contribution from the gluons, the&lt;br/&gt;short-lived particles that hold the quarks together and which account&lt;br/&gt;for much of its mass to see if that is where the missing spin&lt;br/&gt;resides.The measurement of the gluon contribution to the proton spin&lt;br/&gt;will be carried out by adding a special detector for high energy gamma&lt;br/&gt;rays to the STAR detector located at the Relativistic Heavy Ion&lt;br/&gt;Collider. The detector is now being built using separate NSF&lt;br/&gt;construction funds.&lt;br/&gt; The force between pairs of neutrons and protons cannot, by itself,&lt;br/&gt;account for the strength that binds the nucleus together. New,&lt;br/&gt;three-body forces are needed, but their form is almost unknown. By&lt;br/&gt;manipulating the neutron and proton spins when three of them come&lt;br/&gt;together, the PINTEX collaboration would produce a map to guide a theory&lt;br/&gt;of such three-body force. . FY2002 will be the last year of data taking&lt;br/&gt;using the intense beams and unique capabilities of the Indiana&lt;br/&gt;University Cooler Facility to study these three-body forces.&lt;br/&gt; The weak force between nucleons, which can change the form of matter, is still poorly understood. By making a measurement accurate to one part in a billion on the formation of a deuteron from a neutron and a proton, the IU neutron group would measure the longest-range part of the weak force . The Indiana group would support studies of the weak force and other effects accessible using cold neutrons at NIST and LANSCE and by&lt;br/&gt;providing crucial parts of the experimental apparatus. &lt;br/&gt; There is mounting evidence that neutrinos, one of the most ubiquitous&lt;br/&gt;particles in the universe, may have mass, thus changing our most elegant&lt;br/&gt;theories of matter and how it controls the expansion of the universe. &lt;br/&gt;The neutrino group would check a recent observation from LANL of a few&lt;br/&gt;cases where neutrinos, because they have mass, spontaneously change from&lt;br/&gt;one neutrino type into another by collecting a large enough data sample&lt;br/&gt;to settle this issue.&lt;br/&gt; A key component of the Indiana program will be the training of students&lt;br/&gt;to become the next generation of researchers. This effort includes the&lt;br/&gt;involvement of post-doctoral associates in critical experimental roles,&lt;br/&gt;guiding the research of graduate students, involving undergraduates&lt;br/&gt;through the NSF-funded REU summer program and part-time employment, and&lt;br/&gt;reaching out to make the community aware of our scientific mission.</AbstractNarration>
