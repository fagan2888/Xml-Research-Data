    <AbstractNarration>This project is creating a cohort of Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEMS) scholars and incorporating the CSEMS Scholars Program into the college's five-year enrollment enhancement plan. A complete array of student support services are being provided to the members of the CSEMS cohort. Selection of the scholars is the responsibility of a committee comprised of faculty, staff and industry leaders. As a precursor, the college is undertaking a diligent and thorough process of recruiting applicants for the program. This process includes a conscious and consistent effort to recruit an increased number of women for careers in the CSEM areas. As additional support for the CSEMS Scholars, internship and business networking opportunities are being provided. Group and individual support mechanisms include regularly scheduled cohort meetings, academic and career advising, appropriate off-campus experiences, presentations by experts in the CSEM fields and a preparation course for the GRE or GMAT Exams. Those CSEMS Scholars who express an interest in pursuing a career in education are being afforded the opportunity to participate in the Teaching Scholars Program.</AbstractNarration>
