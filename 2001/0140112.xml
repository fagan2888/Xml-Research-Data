    <AbstractNarration>PI: Scott McCullough&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 0140112&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sz. Nagy Dilation Theorem, which models a contraction&lt;br/&gt;operator on Hilbert space as the adjoint of an isometry &lt;br/&gt;restricted to an invariant subspace has had a profound &lt;br/&gt;influence on operator theory and its applications. The &lt;br/&gt;existence of the Agler boundary for families of &lt;br/&gt;representations and of boundary representations &lt;br/&gt;(not necessarily irreducible) and the C-star envelope &lt;br/&gt;for operator algebras are abstract generalizations of &lt;br/&gt;the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem which naturally encode &lt;br/&gt;Pick interpolation and in many cases commutant lifting. &lt;br/&gt;They also provide a natural setting for versions of &lt;br/&gt;Beurling's theorem. The Agler boundary and C-star envelope &lt;br/&gt;have been explicitly computed for the families of &lt;br/&gt;completely contractive representations of the algebra of &lt;br/&gt;multipliers of symmetric Fock space, the algebra &lt;br/&gt;of multipliers of the Dirichlet space, as well as &lt;br/&gt;quotients of the disc and annulus algebra. The PI will &lt;br/&gt;investigate situations in which strong versions of Pick &lt;br/&gt;interpolation, Beurling's theorem, and commutant lifting&lt;br/&gt;hold as a function of the complexity of the corresponding&lt;br/&gt;Agler boundary and C-star envelope. The investigation &lt;br/&gt;will make contact with function theory, special functions, &lt;br/&gt;differential equations, and the general theory of operator &lt;br/&gt;algebras. Thre are also plans to continue studying&lt;br/&gt;factorization of polynomials in several non-commuting &lt;br/&gt;variables pursuing the theme that one-variable results&lt;br/&gt;most naturally generalize to the non-commutative setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Operator theory has a history of rich interplay with &lt;br/&gt;engineering and physics as well as other vital areas of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics including complex function theory and algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry. Originally developed as a tool to study integral &lt;br/&gt;and differential equations arising in physics, operator theory, &lt;br/&gt;operator algebras, and operator systems play an important role &lt;br/&gt;in modern quantum physics. Four fundamental themes in operator &lt;br/&gt;theory, Sz.-Nagy dilation, Pick interpolation, commutant &lt;br/&gt;lifting, and Beurling's theorem are now basic technology in &lt;br/&gt;systems theory which in turn has important applications in image &lt;br/&gt;processing and control theory - the mathematics behind automatic &lt;br/&gt;controllers such as autopilots. A major emphasis in the proposed &lt;br/&gt;work is generalizations of these themes with a view toward &lt;br/&gt;applications to systems theory, control theory, operator algebras, &lt;br/&gt;and function theory. McCullough will also study factorization &lt;br/&gt;problems for polynomials in several non-commuting variables. &lt;br/&gt;(Here xy may not equal yx.) This investigation is&lt;br/&gt;expected to make connection with non-commutative algebraic &lt;br/&gt;geometry and Linear Matrix Inequalities or LMI's which &lt;br/&gt;frequently arise in engineering applications.</AbstractNarration>
