    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;SES 0114689, &lt;br/&gt;Henry Lambright, Syracuse University&lt;br/&gt;Transforming NASA: Space Technology in the Golden Years&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What role does the administrative leader play in change in a federal science and technology agency? There are some scholars who say that role is trivial and others who say the opposite. The answer lies in understanding the relationship between the leader and organization and circumstances in the political environment at the time the leader serves. To explore and analyze that complex relationship, the PI examines Daniel Goldin at NASA in the period 1992 to 2001. Goldin has served longer than any administrator in NASA history, in terms of continuous service. Appointed by George Bush, retained by Bill Clinton, he has been asked by George W. Bush to stay on while the President recruits a replacement. With this much time in office, Goldin has had the opportunity to make a difference. What has he done with that time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study tracks Goldin's role in the organizational and technological change process at NASA. During his tour, he has helped get the Space Station redesigned and linked with the Russians. Called International Space Station, this facility is currently being assembled in space. He has also used a "faster, better, cheaper," management approach to bring down the cost and speed the launch rate of robotic spacecraft, particularly those associated with Mars missions. That approach has had successes (Mars Global Surveyor, Pathfinder) and failures (Mars Climate Orbiter, Mars Polar Lander). He has initiated a host of new programs, reorganized frequently and downsized his agency dramatically. Throughout his tenure, he has worked against the budgetary wind, fought one conflict after another, and become probably the most controversial administrator NASA has had.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a policy process model, this project studies the circumstances prior to Goldin's appointment that caused President Bush to bring an "outsider" to NASA with a mandate for change. The PI tracks Goldin's evolution as an administrator over the years as this business executive/engineer developed political skills to operate in Washington. The project also examines how the ever-shifting political environment impacted his decisions and how Goldin, in turn, influenced that environment. A key issue is how NASA administrator shaped not only an organization but its technologies, imparting to them his values. The PI also examines which of Goldin's changes have had results that were successful, unsuccessful, and mixed, and the reasons why. Finally, the study extends past Goldin's departure to investigate any policy innovations that survived him. This three-year research project culminates in a book on administrative and governmental leadership and change in the contemporary science and technology context.</AbstractNarration>
