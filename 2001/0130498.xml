    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0130498&lt;br/&gt;Robert H. Klenke&lt;br/&gt;Virginia Commonwealth University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NGS Performance Modeling of Complex Hardware/Software Systems through Mixed Level Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a revolutionary new capability by providing a unified design framework for complex, high performance computer systems. This framework includes a performance modeling environment that will be integrated into a mixed level hardware/software design environment through the use of standard Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) and supporting design tools. This framework will allow the modeling of hardware and software systems at a high level to enable rapid design space exploration and system performance analysis. The framework will provide the capability to refine these high level designs in a step-wise manner into models with more design detail and, ultimately into an implementation. This step-wise refinement capability allows areas of the design that are determined to be "high risk" in terms of performance to be refined to a more detailed level where the effects on system performance of assumptions and design can be realized.</AbstractNarration>
