    <AbstractNarration>Computer Science (31)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing curricular materials for an interdisciplinary digital media program to meet four needs: (1) the high interest that college students are showing in digital media, (2) the growing demand for digital media professionals, (3) the need for course material that addresses both the technical and the aesthetic elements of multimedia creation, and (4) the need for a curriculum that balances hands-on experience with fundamental concepts that remain constant beyond fast-changing multimedia development tools. The primary goal of the project is to develop materials that are appropriate to students of either computer science or art, to find the core curriculum necessary for both groups of students, and to present this interdisciplinary material in a well-integrated, modular approach. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curricular materials are divided into three modules: (1) a primer that provides fundamental knowledge required of all students and that concentrates on hands-on exercises; (2) an advanced module that provides the scientific, technical, and mathematical foundation for the students understanding of digital media; and (3) an advanced module that addresses the aesthetics and graphic design issues. The materials cover image processing, digital audio, and digital video and are delivered in an electronic format (Web, CD-ROM, and e-books) with interactive multimedia enhancements.</AbstractNarration>
