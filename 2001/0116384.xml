    <AbstractNarration>With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, Prof. Peter C. of Spelman College will develop a state-of-the-art high speed (100 Hz) Raman-based spectroscopic detector to identify eluents from a high speed gas chromatograph (GC). The resulting instrument will be capable of rapid and accurate identification of GC eluents, able to distinguish among isomers and provide functional group information. Potential applications include a) analysis of air, water or sediment for pollutants; analysis of unknown reation products or compounds found in natural products; c) study of the degradation products of pesticides and herbicides; d) analysis of petroleum products, for example, the presence or fate of additives such as MTBE in groundwater; e) study of the presence or fate of additives or allergens in foods, flavors, feedstock and fragrances; and f) study of polymer decomposition and degassing upon heating. These studies will also provide intensive research training for undergraduate students who are members of underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tandem techniques that interface chromatography with spectroscopic detectors are among the most powerful tools available for analyzing mixtues. By combining two techniques, tandem instruments can overcome the limitations of a single technique, for example spectral congestion due to mixtures, or difficulty identifying unknown species using only chromatographic retention times. This high speed GC/Raman instrument will advance the knowledge in high speed separation science, and find applications in many areas of science, including materials chemistry and environmental sciences.</AbstractNarration>
