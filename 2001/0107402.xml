    <AbstractNarration>0107402 Christensen The objective of this research project is to determine the fate and transport of organic pollutants in the aquatic environment based on receptor models and related methodologies. The emphasis is on polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in dated sediment cores from lakes and rivers. The sediment record offers a convenient means of evaluating not only the present situation but also past trends in physical/chemical and biological degradation, and the relative significance of the different sources. Mathematical methods include factor analysis models which do not depend on preexisting knowledge of degradation or source profiles, and chemical mass balance models in which sources and the relative amounts of various compounds or source profiles must be known. Both categories of pollutants are of concern to the environment and may be present both in point and non-point sources as well as in atmospheric fallout. ***</AbstractNarration>
