    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of the first knowledge management system dedicated specifically to protein localization (ProLoc). Data generated from high-throughput genomic and proteomic experimentation and information published across the entire spectrum of cellular and molecular biology is proliferating at exponential rates. Moreover, current database systems remain incapable of handling the intricate network of relationships between proteins. ProLoc, a database system that integrates expert-curated information from published literature with primary data from a range of experimental methodologies, will begin to attack this problem by focusing on one discrete area of cell biology (protein localization). Researchers will be able to mine pathways and mechanisms, leading to disease elucidation and new therapies. Phase I will be used to create the framework for a functioning relational database, with representative entries for initial beta testing. This will provide an essential foundation for Phase II, when comprehensive content and ancillary tools will be added, creating a highly structured, sophisticated, and interactive relational database system. Once the daunting challenge of reflecting biological pathways into standard database formats has been met through the ProLoc database, the ProLoc structure can be extended to many other cell regulation pathways and processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ProLoc will stand out as an extremely high quality specialized resource in the field of protein localization that will be a necessary part of any set of molecular biology benchtop databases and tools.</AbstractNarration>
