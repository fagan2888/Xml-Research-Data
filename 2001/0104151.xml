    <AbstractNarration>Problems in Surface Geometry and Topology&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Howard Masur&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to work on problems in the geometry &lt;br/&gt;and topology of surfaces. The geometric problems consist of studying the&lt;br/&gt; dynamics of flows on flat surfaces with cone angle singularities. &lt;br/&gt;A particular example is the study of billiards in polygons with angles that &lt;br/&gt;are rational multiples of pi. The particular aspect of this study will be to&lt;br/&gt; attempt to find the asymptotic growth rate for the number of periodic orbits.&lt;br/&gt; For some billiards such as the square, the growth rate is known.&lt;br/&gt; Other more interesting examples are certain right triangles.&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator will study additional examples such as the&lt;br/&gt;square with a slit or barrier. The idea is to find asymptotic quadratic&lt;br/&gt;estimates. The topological problems concern the mapping class group of a &lt;br/&gt;surface. This group is one of the main objects of study in surface topology. &lt;br/&gt; One of the recent developments in group theory is to study the large scale&lt;br/&gt;or asymptotic geometry of a group. The principal investigator proposes to&lt;br/&gt;study the large scale geometry of the mapping class group with a goal of&lt;br/&gt;showing that the mapping class group is quasi-isometrically rigid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the field of dynamical systems one studies the motion of objects. &lt;br/&gt;The field had its origins in the study of the motion of the&lt;br/&gt;planets. Billiards are another closely related example. There one has a&lt;br/&gt;point mass that moves in straight lines so that when it encounters&lt;br/&gt;the boundary of a region, it rebounds so that the angle of reflection&lt;br/&gt;equals the angle of incidence. Billiards have been studied for over 100&lt;br/&gt;years. In order to understand such a dynamical system one&lt;br/&gt;needs to understand the long term behavior of the orbits. One particular&lt;br/&gt;example of this long term behavior are the study of the periodic&lt;br/&gt;orbits. These are the orbits that repeat themselves. The study of&lt;br/&gt;periodic orbits for billiards in polygons in the plane is the main subject&lt;br/&gt;of this proposal.</AbstractNarration>
