    <AbstractNarration>The introduction of double-stranded RNA into cells from a variety organisms, including plants, nematodes, flies, protozoans, and mammals causes potent and specific post-transcriptional gene silencing. In animals, this is called RNA interference (RNAi). It has been hypothesized that the natural role of RNAi may be to protect the germ line from viruses, transposons, and other molecular parasites. A mysterious aspect of RNAi is that gene-specific information is communicated between cells, that is RNAi is systemic. The goal of this project is to identify and characterize C. elegans mutants that either enhance or suppress systemic RNAi, but do not affect autonomous RNAi. A transgenic strain has been constructed that allows direct monitoring of systemic RNAi of a GFP-reporter gene. This strain will be mutagenized and animals with a suppressed or enhanced systemic RNAi response will be isolated and characterized genetically and molecularly. Selected genes will then be cloned and the expression and function of their products will be further characterized.</AbstractNarration>
