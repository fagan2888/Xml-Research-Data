    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Bacteriology and the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin Madison will provide opportunities for summer research projects for undergraduates in microbiology, molecular biology and related fields. Students from colleges with limited opportunities for research and members of groups underrepresented in science are especially encouraged to apply. The main goal of the program is to attract and stimulate motivated students to pursue careers in research, while providing them hands-on experience. Participating students will work as part of a dynamic research team investigating a basic problem in cellular or molecular biology. Students will become familiar with research techniques of microbiology, biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology using modern equipment and facilities. Students will attend professional seminars and make oral presentations of their research findings. They will attend workshops and seminars aimed at preparing them for admissions to competitive graduate programs. Students will be part of a collective group of approximately 100 other students from all over the United States and Puerto Rico participating in other Summer Research Opportunity Programs on campus. REU-Microbiology students will participate with other summer research interns in several social and educational events.</AbstractNarration>
