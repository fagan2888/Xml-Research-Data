    <AbstractNarration>The investigator studies various K-theories of algebraic varieties&lt;br/&gt;and their relation to arithmetic cohomologies. In the case of classical&lt;br/&gt;algebraic K-theory this relation has found numerous applications in&lt;br/&gt;number theory, for example, to special values of L-functions of motives.&lt;br/&gt;In the last couple of year the investigator has introduced log-K-theory&lt;br/&gt;groups of log-schemes (log-scheme is a generalization of a toric variety)&lt;br/&gt;and studied their basic properties. She proposes to continue studying&lt;br/&gt;these groups as well as regulator maps into log-crystalline and log-etale&lt;br/&gt;cohomologies. She believes that this will have important arithmetic&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal deals with number theory and algebraic geometry. &lt;br/&gt;Number theory is the study of the properties of the whole numbers&lt;br/&gt;and is the oldest branch of mathematics. Algebraic geometry studies&lt;br/&gt;geometric figures that can be defined by the simplest of equations,&lt;br/&gt;namely polynomials. The questions and phenomena which arise from&lt;br/&gt;combining these two subjects serve as driving forces in much of&lt;br/&gt;contemporary mathematics research. Moreover, the combination of&lt;br/&gt;these subjects has contributed many applications in such diverse&lt;br/&gt;areas as codes and data transmission, robotics, and theoretical&lt;br/&gt;computer science.</AbstractNarration>
