    <AbstractNarration>Ecologists often rely on computer-intensive Monte Carlo simulations to quantify patterns of population and community structure. These models are called null models, because they are null with respect to a certain process, such as interspecific competition. EcoSim is a Windows-based interactive simulation software application that allows for a variety of null model analyses. The program currently contains modules for the analysis of species diversity, species co-occurrence, niche overlap, body size overlap, and macroecology. The current proposal will allow for the development of new EcoSim modules for the analysis of spatial and temporal patterns at the population and community level. Community modules include tests of concordance, spatial co-occurrence, biogeographic overlap, and Markovian succession. Population modules include analyses of density-dependence, population viability, spatial pattern, and distance covariance. EcoSim is widely used by the academic and educational community, as both a research and a teaching tool. It frees researchers and educators from the time-consuming chores of programming, testing, and debugging ecologically relevant programs. The program contains extensive documentation, sample data sets, a tutorial, and an html-based help system. The program is available at no cost to the public and scientific community from the EcoSim website.</AbstractNarration>
