    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0103985&lt;br/&gt;Alan Dow&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principle Investigator proposes to focus on three &lt;br/&gt;central problems in set-theoretic topology which involve &lt;br/&gt;basic countable convergence issues and set-theoretic &lt;br/&gt;independence results. The first question, due to Efimov, &lt;br/&gt;is to determine if it is consistent that any compact &lt;br/&gt;space that does not contain a converging sequence will &lt;br/&gt;contain the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers. &lt;br/&gt;The second, due to Bashkirov, is to determine if there &lt;br/&gt;can be a countable bound on the sequential order of a compact sequential space. This problem can, in some ways, be viewed &lt;br/&gt;as a very interesting strengthening of the recently resolved Moore-Mrowka problem. The third is to continue a systematic &lt;br/&gt;study of the Stone-Cech remainder of the reals analogous to &lt;br/&gt;that which has long been conducted for the remainder of the &lt;br/&gt;integers. There appears to be many obstructions to progess &lt;br/&gt;caused by the additional complexity imposed by the connectedness property.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General questions of the existence of converging sequences &lt;br/&gt;and the extent to which converging sequences fully determine &lt;br/&gt;the topological structure arise frequently in a variety of &lt;br/&gt;settings. These questions are particularly meaningful in the &lt;br/&gt;context of compact subsets of function spaces (natural&lt;br/&gt;informative topologies on sets of real-valued functions). &lt;br/&gt;The investigator is continuing to pursue lines of investigation &lt;br/&gt;that have stimulated intensive interaction between the fields &lt;br/&gt;of general topology and set-theory for de</AbstractNarration>
