    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing, implementing, and assessing student-driven, hypothesis testing laboratory modules for introductory and upper level courses in our Environmental Science Program. Our project provides students with field opportunities to conduct hypothesis testing by revising current laboratory curriculum and improving field testing instrumentation. The targeted courses may lack student-driven, field investigation components, contain limited field investigations due to lack of equipment, or do not offer a laboratory course due to lack of equipment. Investigative modules are based on concepts developed by Switzer and Shriner (2000) and Eisen (1998) and successful models for field site investigations&lt;br/&gt;implemented at the Florida Institute of Technology, Northern Arizona University, and Middlebury College. Our primary goal is to provide students with active and cooperative learning techniques to improve their understanding of the hypothesis-testing nature of science. Each module requires students to generate hypotheses for "environmental risk" at one of four common study sites. Individual groups within classes are testing hypotheses on-site, analyziong their data, presenting their results to the class, and conducting peer assessments of individual student and group work. Our assessment plan aims to determine if the implemented modules improve student use of problem-solving skills and the scientific method to test hypotheses. The project results will be disseminated by presentation at scientific and education meetings, by web-site, instructor manual supplements, and peer-reviewed journals, and by two GLOBE summer workshops for high school teachers and UTC student science teachers.</AbstractNarration>
