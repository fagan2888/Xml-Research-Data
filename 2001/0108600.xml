    <AbstractNarration>A three-year program of comprehensive studies of ionospheric E- and F-region electrodynamics and of related aeronomic issues surrounding meteor-derived metals in the upper atmosphere is proposed. The proposed studies are based on an extensive ongoing observing program at Arecibo Observatory (AO) that involves incoherent scatter radar (ISR) and meteor-mode radar as well as proposed associated metal (Ca/Ca+, Fe, K, Na) lidar observations. AO is uniquely suited for these proposed studies with the new dual-beam capability yielding the first true 3-D observations, extreme sensitivity and directivity in both ISR and meteor-modes, and the common-volume lidar capabilities. The proposed observational and theoretical studies are intended to comprehensively test and extend the hypotheses and conclusions concerning the origin and scale of the apparently "new" electrodynamic processes resulting plasma-sheets and related phenomena including true sporadic-E and in firmly tying micrometeoroid atmospheric-entry processes to the aeronomy of metals in the upper atmosphere and to provide whole-earth micrometeoroid mass fluxes of unprecedented accuracy.</AbstractNarration>
