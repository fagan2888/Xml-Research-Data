    <AbstractNarration>0116481&lt;br/&gt;Pollock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation grant provides funding for the acquisition of a high-performance X-ray diffraction (XRD) system and supporting computer and software. The XRD will support research projects in geology, soil science and archaeology. Primary use of the XRD will be to determine qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative mineralogical compositions of very fine-grained rocks, glacio - marine and glacio - lacustrine clay, mangrove swamp clay, urban soils, and pottery. Individual research and research collaborations (between the departments of Geosciences, Environmental Science &amp; Policy and Geography &amp; Anthropology) range from advanced research in fine-grained rocks, urban soils and archaeological artifacts to research training issues for individuals working with disabled students. Archaeological geology research characterizes archaeological stone artifacts, pottery and ceramics. Additionally this instrument will support research on very fine-grained consolidated and unconsolidated archaeological source materials. The multidisciplinary research efforts that this instrument supports are fully in line with long-term infrastructure objectives at the University of Southern Maine. MRI funding greatly enhances the research and education environment in that it broadens and deepens the research and teaching potential of three undergraduate departments. The total incorporation of the proposed scientific research with undergraduate education will greatly increase the scientific literacy of our students. University of Southern Maine undergraduates will be active participants in research that is conducted with this equipment. Students involved with this instrument will actively collaborate with faculty through in-depth involvement in data collection and interpretation. Women and other underrepresented groups choosing to take courses offered by these departments will have the opportunity to gain experience and competence in working with advanced technological equipment as a normal part of their education. Instructuction will emphasize direct, 'hands-on' experience in field and laboratory research. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
