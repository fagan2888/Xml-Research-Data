    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing diversity in the Geosciences: A Bridging Program from Middle School to College&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Increasing diversity in the geosciences requires a multi-faceted program that offers enrichment opportunities for students throughout their educational process. The approach used in this project develops a pathway from middle school to college that expands the pipeline of diverse students entering advanced education and careers in the geosciences. Hampton University, a Historically Black College and University (HBCU), will provide minority role models, mentors, and research opportunities. Unique to Hampton University is the collaboration between the Center for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) and the Interdisciplinary Science Center (ISC). These work to increase the pipeline of underrepresented students enabling them to access careers in science. The active partnership between CAS and the ISC provides a connection between the scientists of CAS and the science educators of the ISC, which extends to the K-14 education community and informal science education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities in this project target three primary areas of activity that will provide opportunities and participation of underrepresented groups in the geosciences and bridge those activities from middle school through college and into careers. These areas include Informal K-14 Education Outreach, Formal K-14 Education Outreach, and University Education and Outreach.</AbstractNarration>
