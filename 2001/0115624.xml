    <AbstractNarration>The Psychophysiology Laboratory within the Department of Psychology at Wheeling Jesuit University will purchase equipment for the construction of a sleep research laboratory. The primary equipment will consist of a BioPac MP100 Data Acquisition System and Samadhi Light and Sound Attenuation Chamber. The BioPac MP100 Data Acquisition System is a flexible, easy-to-use modular system designed to perform data collection and analysis. The software allows for recording, analysis, and data filtering in real time and off-line. The software also provides analysis tools for EMG, EEG, ECG, EOG, plethysmography, evoked responses, cardiovascular hemodynamics, pulmonary function, exercise physiology, sleep studies, in-vitro pharmacology, and psychophysiology. Accessory components include the hardware unit, computer cards, manuals, cables, transformers, electrode leads, galvanic skin response transducer, pulse phethysmograph transducer, respiratory effort transducer, air flow transducer, reaction timer, headphones, pressure transducer, variable range force transducer, stimulator, blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, hand dynamometer, and multi-lead cables. The Samadhi Light and Sound Attenuation Chamber is a lightweight, portable chamber designed to provide barriers to external lights, sounds, and other stimulation that might otherwise disrupt normal sleep. Light and temperature control accessories make the sleep environment as comfortable as possible for the participants, while observation cameras, a two-way intercom system, and video recording devices are installed to provide for constant participant monitoring and recording. The PI will use this equipment to assess the impact of odorant administration on (1) physiological changes during sleep, (2) measures of sleep quality and duration, and (3) measures of post-sleep cognitive performance and wakefulness. The equipment will also be used by other departmental faculty members in facilitating studies on social isolation, echo-location, child psychopathology, and cognitive mapping. This equipment will enhance current departmental research capabilities and extend the department's ability to afford undergraduates with meaningful and technologically advanced research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
