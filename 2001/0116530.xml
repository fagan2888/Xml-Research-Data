    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Cornell University to acquire an Energy Filtering Transmission Electron Microscope (EFTEM). The new capabilities for atomic scale imaging provided by the LEO 922 OMEGA, particularly the abilities to rapidly obtain element-specific image contrast and to image thick samples at low beam energies, will enable an extraordinarily broad range of research. These research projects are led by principal investigators from four Colleges and eleven departments at Cornell University. It will also be available for use by outside collaborators and users, academic, government or industrial organizations. The research topics range from studies of complex polymeric, ceramic and metallic materials to biological cells, their internal structures and metal ion concentrations. Central to meeting these research goals is the training of many post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students in the use and exploitation of such a powerful research tool. Since it will be only the second machine of its type in the US, this will be a fantastic and almost unique opportunity to carry out frontier research. It is clear that the EFTEM will have a large institutional impact and will be an important resource for the external community of scientists and students who will be visitors and users, some of whom will be coming primarily to use the EFTEM. It will further enable us to attract and retain the best faculty and students, including women and minorities. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Cornell University to acquire an Energy Filtering Transmission Electron Microscope (EFTEM).
