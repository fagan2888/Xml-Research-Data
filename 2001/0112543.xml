    <AbstractNarration>While hormonal responses to stress are well known, the mechanisms of neural &lt;br/&gt;control in regulating such responses are not well understood. An animal under &lt;br/&gt;stress shows increased blood levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH. &lt;br/&gt;ACTH in turn stimulates steroidogenesis in the tissue of the adrenal cortex, which &lt;br/&gt;generates and releases corticosterone, a steroid glucocorticoid compound. &lt;br/&gt;However, there has been a long-standing problem that the patterns of ACTH &lt;br/&gt;levels in the blood often do not match changes in circulating glucocorticoid levels. &lt;br/&gt;Recent discoveries suggest that this steroidogenic response of the adrenal &lt;br/&gt;cortex also is regulated by activity of the splanchnic nerve coming from the spinal &lt;br/&gt;cord. This renewal project combines physiological and molecular approaches to &lt;br/&gt;identify the mechanisms involved. Experiments will test how blocking neural &lt;br/&gt;activity changes the expression of biochemical enzymes and receptor proteins &lt;br/&gt;that are part of the steroidogenic pathway, how neuronal stimulation might &lt;br/&gt;modulate changes by regulating adrenal blood flow, and which nerve fiber types &lt;br/&gt;(preganglionic sympathetic or primary afferent fibers) mediate the observed &lt;br/&gt;changes in steroidogenesis.&lt;br/&gt; Results will define a novel mechanism for regulation of hormone activity in &lt;br/&gt;response to stress, which will have an impact on understanding neural control &lt;br/&gt;systems in general, and can be important for management of stress in contexts &lt;br/&gt;such as agriculture as well as human behavior. The project also involves student &lt;br/&gt;training in state-of-the-art technology in a very productive laboratory.</AbstractNarration>
