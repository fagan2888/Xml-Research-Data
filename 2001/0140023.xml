    <AbstractNarration>March 6, 2002&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Gustavo Ponce. DMS-0140023&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal title : Nonlinear Dispersive Equations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years there has been a significant progress on&lt;br/&gt;the study of qualitative behavior of solution to nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;dispersive systems. The relation between dispersive and nonlinear effects&lt;br/&gt;has motivated several remarkable works. Among them one finds&lt;br/&gt;sharp local and global wellposedness theories under minimal regularity &lt;br/&gt;assumptions on the data, precise blow up results as well as ill-posedness &lt;br/&gt;ones. As a consequence our understanding of several phenomena in nature is &lt;br/&gt;now more complete. The principal investigator will focus on several&lt;br/&gt;representative problems connected with partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations arising in wave propagation and fluid mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The wave propagation in diverse mediums and the interaction of&lt;br/&gt;different kind of waves can be modeled by complicated systems of&lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations. These systems involve many variables&lt;br/&gt;which depends of the particular physical setting of the problem. In many &lt;br/&gt;cases, these systems are too complicated to be treated with reasonable &lt;br/&gt;accuracy, thus one has to consider approximated models. The validity of these &lt;br/&gt;approximations is essential to further study of the physical phenomenon. One &lt;br/&gt;has to give precise conditions under which the qualitative behavior of the &lt;br/&gt;solution of these approximated models captures the features of the physical &lt;br/&gt;setting. It is here where the theoretical study of these solutions become &lt;br/&gt;essential. Thus, one starts with special solutions and its properties, &lt;br/&gt;stability, long time behavior, ill-posedness, etc. In situations where these &lt;br/&gt;theoretical results are unavailable one needs to start the study with &lt;br/&gt;appropriate numerical simulations.</AbstractNarration>
