    <AbstractNarration>In heterogeneous distributed computing, a network of dissimilar machines is used to&lt;br/&gt;execute a given application in parallel. With the advent of advanced network technologies,&lt;br/&gt;the scale at which heterogeneous computing can be practicaly applied is growing to a&lt;br/&gt;global scale, thus making it possible to collect high performance computers across the&lt;br/&gt;globe into a single computational resource. Multiple users will be able to simulataneously&lt;br/&gt;use this computational resource to execute a variety of large, parallel applications.&lt;br/&gt;However, there are a number of problems to solve before this type of computing becomes a&lt;br/&gt;reality.&lt;br/&gt;Therefore this project proposes to develop effective matching and scheduling methods to&lt;br/&gt;allow multiple users to execute applications in a large, decentralized, failure-prone,&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous computing environment. Due to the dynamic and uncertain nature of this&lt;br/&gt;environment, the algorithms that will be developed will use statistical techniques to&lt;br/&gt;allocate resources fairly in a highly dynamic system. The algorithms will be evaluated by&lt;br/&gt;simulations and also on a small testbed. There are three different aspects of this&lt;br/&gt;proposed work:&lt;br/&gt;1. Methods will be developed to statistically obtain an estimate of the response time of a&lt;br/&gt;task on an arbitrary target machine. This will be accomplished by developing separate&lt;br/&gt;techniques to estimate the execution time, machine loads, and network loads. A method for&lt;br/&gt;estimating the execution time using data gathered from past executions of the task has&lt;br/&gt;already been developed. This method will be refined and similar stochastic methods will be&lt;br/&gt;developed for machine and network load estimation.&lt;br/&gt;2. A dynamic matching and scheduling method for heterogeneous machines will be developed.&lt;br/&gt;This method will allow each application to make scheduling decisions without direct&lt;br/&gt;knowledge of the other applications executing in the environment. Each application will&lt;br/&gt;have to compete for the computational resources of the network. The scheduling heuristics&lt;br/&gt;will take into account the uncertainty in the stochastic estimates of the execution time&lt;br/&gt;and machine and network loads.&lt;br/&gt;3. Finally, reliable scheduling algorithms based on either heuristic cost functions or&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of the reliability of applications will be developed. The heuristic cost&lt;br/&gt;functions developed will define the impact of a scheduling decision on the reliability of&lt;br/&gt;an application in time units. These algorithms will consider both the execution time and&lt;br/&gt;failure probability of applications while making scheduling decisions, and thus, will be&lt;br/&gt;capable of producing task assignments that improve both the performance and reliability of&lt;br/&gt;applications. In addition, algorithms which can trade performance for reliability of&lt;br/&gt;applications will be designed.</AbstractNarration>
