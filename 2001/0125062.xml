    <AbstractNarration>The 2001 International Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators represents an&lt;br/&gt;important opportunity to capture a perspective on the current state of the art in microstructure&lt;br/&gt;fabrication and the development of MicroElectroMechanical Systems. The 11th International&lt;br/&gt;Conference on Solid-State Sensors and Actuators (Transducers '01) will be held in Munich,&lt;br/&gt;Germany, from June 10-14, 2001.&lt;br/&gt;Transducers is a biennial conference focusing on theory, design, fabrication, and&lt;br/&gt;application of solid-state sensors, actuators, and microsystems. It is an interdisciplinary gathering&lt;br/&gt;with participants from university, government, and industrial laboratories representing diverse&lt;br/&gt;cross spectrum of fields: electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, materials science,&lt;br/&gt;biomedical engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and microelectronics.&lt;br/&gt;We propose to partially sponsor travel for student authors of papers from North America&lt;br/&gt;to this conference. These student authors have been selected from a very competitive pool of&lt;br/&gt;abstract submissions, and represent the most talented young members of the MEMS community.&lt;br/&gt;These students will travel to the conference to present their own work, and then spend the&lt;br/&gt;remainder of the week attending presentations and discussions, gathering information on the&lt;br/&gt;most important breakthrough technologies revealed at the conference. Much of the fabrication&lt;br/&gt;and integration technology is of direct relevance to technologies and applications funded through&lt;br/&gt;NSF Electronics and Controls Systems office. Each of these students will write a brief report&lt;br/&gt;describing the important technologies they learned about at the conference, and these will be&lt;br/&gt;gathered into a summary report to NSF highlighting new trends in this community, important&lt;br/&gt;thrusts initiated by other countries, and areas where the US technological base holds advantages&lt;br/&gt;or disadvantages.&lt;br/&gt;The funding that we request will allow partial travel support for approximately 12 student&lt;br/&gt;authors from various institutions in North America.</AbstractNarration>
