    <AbstractNarration>The American Evaluation Association (AEA) is the only National professional association for evaluators in the U.S. and, as such, should speak for the profession on National policy issues. However, AEA has never before provided guidance to the broader community on public policy issues and therefore lacks the procedures to do so. Having such a voice is particularly critical now with the current debate of the Bush Administration's proposal to test all 4th and 8th grade public school students in mathematics and reading. Because the testing proposal deals specifically with actions that to be taken with regard to public schools based on the outcomes of the tests, this is primarily an evaluation issue and would benefit from an analysis by evaluators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AEA will create a process for developing a policy statement on the Bush Administration testing issue and on three other issues to be selected later that also address concerns of the mathematics and science community. The aim is to establish an ongoing capability within the AEA organization to mobilize the organization's resources to deal with policy questions.</AbstractNarration>
