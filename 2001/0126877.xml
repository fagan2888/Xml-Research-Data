    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt; Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) is using this CCLI-A&amp;I project to redesign its core engineering science courses by transforming the instructional methodology from one that is primarily lecture based to one that emphasizes active learning in a laboratory setting. The aim is to enhance students understanding of engineering theory and develop their analytical skills. The project is the result of recommendations made by an outside evaluator, and discussions between our faculty and engineering faculty from several four year institutions. Our faculty are working with representatives from The City College of New York (CCNY), the University of Virginia (UV) and the Louisiana Technological University (LTU) to adapt and implement exemplary educational materials and pedagogical strategies that have been successfully tested and implemented at each of these institutions. The specifically topics are:&lt;br/&gt;1) Circuits--adapt and implement (a&amp;i) a set of laboratory exercises developed at CCNY School of Engineering. Hands-on activities are complemented by the use of Electronic Workbench and LabView software.&lt;br/&gt;2) Graphics--a&amp;i computer based activities such as solid modeling using Pro/Engineer software as are used at CCNY and other schools. &lt;br/&gt;3) Mechanics-- a&amp;i a series of hands-on exercises such as Working Model as was developed at LTU.&lt;br/&gt;4) Thermodynamics--a&amp;i a set of workshops developed at UV. Simulations and analysis at the workshops are supported by the CYCLEPAD software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In support of these curricular reforms, this project is setting up a computer laboratory and an experimental engineering science laboratory equipped with up-to-date software and instruments. A training program consisting of workshops conducted by faculty from the model institutions ensures that our faculty are knowledgeable in the pedagogical methods of the model institutions and are capable of using active learning and project based activities. The measurable outcome of the project will be a manual for the four courses, which will include hands-on laboratory experiments and computer activities. A separate manual consisting of student projects will also be an outcome product. These products will be disseminated at national and regional engineering meetings and will be made available on the college's web site.</AbstractNarration>
