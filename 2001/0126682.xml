    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;As a part of the CCLI A&amp;I grant entitled Implementing Reform in an Internet-Based&lt;br/&gt;Classroom, the mathematics department at East Tennessee State University implemented a pilot program, which provided a technology-intensive laboratory experience for certain sections of elementary statistics courses. This experiment showed that the use of technology in elementary statistics increases retention, fosters participation, and improves conceptual understanding of statistical concepts. Indeed, students in the program were significantly more successful than those in the general population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order for technology to truly make a difference in student learning, it must be delivered within an entirely different type of course. Hence, this project creates an elementary statistics course that incorporates software packages such as Minitab, online materials such as those in the Rice Virtual Lab in Statistics (NSF DUE 9751307, 07/97-06/99), and the best of curriculum reform. The best means to do so is to transform statistical instruction into a multi-faceted program that develops students' mathematical abilities in a step-by-step process.</AbstractNarration>
