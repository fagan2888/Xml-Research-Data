    <AbstractNarration>Current scenarios of predicted environmental change raise fundamental&lt;br/&gt;questions about the expected responses of animal populations to changes in&lt;br/&gt;local climate and food availability. Animal responses to environment are&lt;br/&gt;mediated by physiological functions such as metabolism, digestion, growth&lt;br/&gt;and reproduction. Using parallel simulation modeling and experimental&lt;br/&gt;studies in the laboratory and in nature, the PI will investigate the effect&lt;br/&gt;of food availability on reproduction in the timber rattlesnake (Crotalus&lt;br/&gt;horridus) in northwest Arkansas. Rattlesnakes are excellent subjects for&lt;br/&gt;these studies because of their abundance and large size which allows the&lt;br/&gt;use of radio-transmitters (for location and body temperature information).&lt;br/&gt;The simulation model is based on information about energy flow through&lt;br/&gt;timber rattlesnakes discovered under a previous grant (IBN 9728470). New&lt;br/&gt;studies will build upon and complement previous work. A laboratory&lt;br/&gt;population of snakes will be maintained under three feeding regimes&lt;br/&gt;designed to produce variation in reproduction. In nature, an experimental&lt;br/&gt;food manipulation will test model predictions by comparing reproduction&lt;br/&gt;between supplementally fed and control groups of radio-tagged female&lt;br/&gt;rattlesnakes. Information gathered from these experiments will be used to&lt;br/&gt;test previous predictions made by the simulation model, and then to refine&lt;br/&gt;and improve the simulation. The results of this study will enhance our&lt;br/&gt;ability to predict the responses of animal populations to environmental&lt;br/&gt;change. The described studies will also provide multiple opportunities to&lt;br/&gt;enhance science literacy and involve students (from grade school to&lt;br/&gt;graduate school) in the process of science.</AbstractNarration>
