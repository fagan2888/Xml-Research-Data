    <AbstractNarration>The Design and Development of a Network Process Migration System&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intensive research has been done in process migration and mobility. However, most present successes are&lt;br/&gt;based on safe-languages such as Java. While this safe-language approach provides a satisfactory solution for many applications, it has inherent limitations, especially for technical computing applications. During the last few years, the Principle Investigator (PI) and his research group have developed a set of methodologies to support heterogeneous process migration for high performance computing. This has included a practical data-collection-restoration methodology applicable to codes written in legacy languages such as C or Fortran, an effective data representation and transfer scheme for heterogeneous network environments, and a feasible&lt;br/&gt;communication protocol for process coordination in a migration-supported dynamic environment. In this research, the PI proposes to further test these existing methodologies, develop a methodology for I/O state&lt;br/&gt;transfer, and explore the design of an integrated network process migration system to support process migration of legacy codes written in stack-based languages such as C, Fortran, or C++ in a heterogeneous &lt;br/&gt;network environment.</AbstractNarration>
