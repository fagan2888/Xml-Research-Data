    <AbstractNarration>The applied research project builds on the IMD funded "Where are We?" and poses the following research questions: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Do students perform significantly better on real-world map tasks after using WAW?&lt;br/&gt;What specific misconceptions and weaknesses remain widespread among students after using the materials? How much improvement in student performance on map skills tasks would be expected after using the curriculum? &lt;br/&gt;How can teachers tell whether student learning has occurred?&lt;br/&gt;What is the relationship between teachers' spatial abilities and the likelihood they would use the materials?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop quantitative, reliable field-based assessments of map skills and use them, along with other instruments, with three populations: elementary students using the materials; children over the 7-15 age range who do not uses the materials; and preservice elementary teachers. Results from these assessments will be used in a redesign of the materials.</AbstractNarration>
