    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to make the physiology student laboratories at Truman State University more investigative. The main obstacle in transforming our laboratories from traditional formulative exercises into student-driven investigations lies in our data handling capabilities. The stand-alone instruments we had been using require manual adjustments for which no record is generated, which made it difficult to compare data from different instruments or work sessions. In addition, the data records consisted of extensive collections of strip charts. There was no efficient method for sharing these records within a work group. Worse yet, this form of record did not facilitate in-depth analysis, comparisons, and contrasts; quantitative evaluations could only be made after painstaking hands-on measurement of each bit of pertinent record. This project is upgrading the technology of our physiology labs with the aim of improving our data collection and interpretation capabilities by providing instruments which allow computerized data acquisition and analysis. It is an adaptation of models introduced by the University of Central Florida, Harvey Mudd College, California State University at Hayward, and Cornell University, with NSF support. The expected outcomes of this project are: 1) students able to design and carry out procedures which allow them to answer specific physiological questions; 2) the ability to highlight the relationships between procedures, data, and the interpretation of data so that students have a better understanding of how "real science" works; and 3) giving the students an opportunity to compare and contrast results from related procedures and draw conclusions therefrom.</AbstractNarration>
