    <AbstractNarration>Submitted under the guidelines for Teacher Retention and Renewal, this 49-month project is "designed to develop a cadre of teachers, leaders, supervisors and collegiate mathematics educators who will act as change agents responsible for implementing standards-based high school mathematics reform" [project summary]. More specifically, the project provides (a) comprehensive professional development for 256 high school teachers in Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin so they can effectively implement national goals for standards-based mathematics education through implementation of the Core-Plus instructional materials in their classrooms; (b) leadership development for 16 master teachers who are experienced with Core-Plus; (c) leadership development, structured workshop and classroom observation, and preservice or inservice leadership experience for eight college professors and eight school mathematics curriculum supervisors; and (d) experiences for participants to work with all stakeholders, such as parents and administrators, on behalf of standards-based renewal of school mathematics education. The project's teacher-participants engage in professional development in two cadres, each for two years, for at least six weeks over the life of the project; university/college professors and school mathematics supervisors participate for approximately four weeks.</AbstractNarration>
