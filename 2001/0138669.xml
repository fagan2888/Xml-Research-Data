    <AbstractNarration>An ongoing observational record of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, total peroxynitrates, total alkylnitrates, nitric acid, and total odd nitrogen (NOy) at the University of California Blodgett Forest Research Station will be extended. The PI has developed a novel instrument based on thermal dissociation - laser-induced fluorescence (TD-LIF) with four channels. In addition, the PI plans to measure UV irradiance. Through collaborations, measurements of ozone, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide will be available. Box- and 1-dimensional modeling will be used to understand and interpret past and ongoing measurements. Furthermore, the PI intends to demonstrate the capability of his instrument for carrying out eddy-covariance flux measurements, and then carry out a full annual cycle of measurements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, if successful, will demonstrate new technology for trace gas concentration and flux measurements, and will provide new insights into the photochemistry of forested areas that are partially impacted by anthropogenic pollution.</AbstractNarration>
