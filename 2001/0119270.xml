    <AbstractNarration>This research aims to understand and automate the mechanisms by which language can emerge among artificial, knowledge-based and rational agents that interact in open, heterogeneous, and distributed environments. The intent is to design and implement agents that, upon encountering other agent(s) with which they do not share an agent communication language, are able to initiate creation of, and further are able to evolve and enrich, a mutually understandable communication language. The novelty of this research is that it enables the agents to develop and evolve, on their own, the capacity of communicating via a common language, as opposed to relying on this ability to be pre-designed and built into the agents by their designers. This research is supported by two streams of research, 1) the design of rational, socially competent artificial agents, and 2) the mechanism of negotiation as developed in game theory and automated in artificial intelligence research. This work will contribute to fundamental research in heterogeneous and open multiagent systems, effective communication among artificial agents in realistic settings, practical multiagent system design and the training of undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
