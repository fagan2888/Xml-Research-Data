    <AbstractNarration>DMS Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award #: 0102841&lt;br/&gt;PI: Truskinovsky, Lev &lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Minnesota, Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;Program: Applied Mathematics&lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Catherine Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Mathematical Models of Materials with Multi-Stability at the Micro-Level&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose to study rate sensitivity of the prototypical discrete analogs of active materials. At the micro-level, active materials can be viewed as complex assemblages of multi-stable, molecular size devices; large deformations are then due to the switching between different locally stable configurations. At the macro-level the switching leads to the energy flux into smaller scales and &lt;br/&gt;associated dissipation. In this project we focus on optimization of energy transduction between the scales in multi-stable materials and specifically consider behavior of these systems in the situations where fluctuations are relevant and the size effect can not be neglected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research project we study the dynamic behavior of active materials which include shape-memory, magnetostrictive and ferromagnetic alloys, transformation-toughened ceramics and materials, exhibiting controllable distributed micro-damage. Biological examples of active materials are provided by muscles and other distributed protein systems. The goal of the project is to understand the mechanics of dissipation and active force generation in these materials which may open ways to an actual construction of the artificial molecular size motors. Specifically we &lt;br/&gt;are interested in developing prototypes for ultra-small objects, which can carry load and be self propelled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: J</AbstractNarration>
