    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing modules within an immersive virtual environment (VE) in &lt;br/&gt;order to examine whether or not such environments provide an effective venue for education. &lt;br/&gt;The environment being developed is based upon four principles. First, a high level of &lt;br/&gt;interactivity is necessary to allow students opportunities for active learning. Second, &lt;br/&gt;VE technology is used as a supplement to other methods of learning. Third, the environment &lt;br/&gt;contains many types of information and presents links between them. Finally, the 3D &lt;br/&gt;visualization realistically portrays information that is abstract or normally not visible in &lt;br/&gt;the physical world. The modules being developed are in structural engineering, computer &lt;br/&gt;networks, and computer graphics and we are integrating them into the curriculum in order to &lt;br/&gt;evaluate their effectiveness. The results of this work include a set of well-tested &lt;br/&gt;educational VE applications, guidelines for designing educational VEs, and principles for &lt;br/&gt;deciding when a VE is an appropriate choice for an educational goal and it is intended to &lt;br/&gt;provide a real and substantial improvement to the learning environments of many students as &lt;br/&gt;well as innovative VE research.</AbstractNarration>
