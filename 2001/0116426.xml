    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program Youngstown State University will acquire a powder X-ray Diffractometer system to support the research needs of faculty, master's level students, and undergraduate students at the institution. The instrument will also support research and training of faculty and students at other colleges that are part a consortium of users affiliated with single crystal X-ray facility at Youngstown State University. The X-ray Diffractometer will provide data of sufficiently high quality to enable structure determinations of powder samples, which is not possible with multi-wire detector currently used for powder analysis. The instrument will be available on hands-on basis to students in upper level laboratory courses and thus will positively education and training at the institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation program Youngstown State University will acquire a powder X-ray Diffractometer system to support the research needs of faculty, master's level students, and undergraduate students at the institution.
