    <AbstractNarration>X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most useful methods for the analysis of surfaces, interfaces and thin films; with sensitivity at the nanometer scale. It is a critical tool for basic and applied research and development of new semiconductors, biomaterials, fuel cells, gene chips, amorphous metals, optical fibers, and optical/electronic polymers. This materials research is enabling to the advancement of telecommunications, computers, energy and biotechnology where XPS plays an additional role in manufacturing science and quality control. This award from the Instrumentation for Material research program will allow Penn State to purchase a new state-of-the-art XPS, increasing the availability for undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff various fields of materials and engineering research. The instrument will also be vital to teaching a number of courses that detail the theory and practice of XPS, and for hands on training with access to modern equipment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most useful methods for the analysis of surfaces, interfaces and thin films; with sensitivity at the nanometer scale.
