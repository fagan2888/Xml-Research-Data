    <AbstractNarration>An NSF Microbial Observatories grant has been awarded to Drs. Holly Pinkart (Central Washington University), Melanie Mormile (University of Missouri-Rolla), and Brent Peyton (Washington State University) to study the anaerobic microbial ecology of a saline, alkaline lake. Soap Lake is a permanently stratified lake consisting two separate water layers which have not mixed for over two thousand years. Although both layers are quite alkaline and lack significant amounts of oxygen, the lower layer is an order of magnitude more saline. Additionally, this lake has concentrations of sulfide generally considered toxic for most life forms. In spite of the extreme chemistry of this environment, the lake supports thriving communities of algae, zooplankton, and bacteria. The Microbial Observatory will allow the study and quantification of the ecology and metabolic capabilities of the relatively unknown microorganisms that thrive in this extreme environment. The goals of the project are to characterize the microbial communities that inhabit this system, and determine how they affect, and are affected by, the geochemistry of Soap Lake. The methods that will be used include the culturing of microorganisms, cloning and sequencing of microbial DNA, and the use of satellite imaging for detection of microbial activities. The Soap Lake Microbial Observatory will serve as a model for studying interactions of the anaerobic communities in haloalkaline environments and their contribution to biomass production.&lt;br/&gt; Results generated by this project will supplement data available for the search for biological activity on Mars and extra-solar terrestrial environments, and will augment the Virtual Planet Laboratory Program being developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The Microbial Observatory at Soap Lake will likely lead to discovery of novel microorganisms useful in industry and biotechnology. Additionally, this project will allow for the significant involvement of undergraduate students, and could serve as a model for the integration of research into undergraduate education.</AbstractNarration>
