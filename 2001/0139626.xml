    <AbstractNarration>Knight and her students will work on various aspects of&lt;br/&gt;computable structure theory. Knight plans to continue work with&lt;br/&gt;D'Aquino on weak fragments of arithmetic. She expects also to&lt;br/&gt;continue work with Goncharov and Harizanov, with Young, and with&lt;br/&gt;Shore, on a collection of inter-related problems involving&lt;br/&gt;complicated relations on computable structures, structures of&lt;br/&gt;high rank, and paths through Kleene's O. She is currently&lt;br/&gt;working with Csima, Hirschfeldt, and Soare on prime models and&lt;br/&gt;lowness properties. She plans to work with Lempp, McCoy, and&lt;br/&gt;Solomon on Boolean algebras. The funds are mainly for student&lt;br/&gt;travel and books. The remainder is for partial support of the&lt;br/&gt;Notre Dame Logic Seminar. Currently, Knight has two students.&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Arana, who may finish this summer, has a number of results&lt;br/&gt;on complexity in arithmetic, using some new independent sentences&lt;br/&gt;(variants of the Godel-Rosser sentence). Arana is now&lt;br/&gt;concentrating on problems of a more foundational nature. Wesley&lt;br/&gt;Calvert, a second year student, is working on complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;isomorphism problem for various familiar classes of computable&lt;br/&gt;structures. He already has results for several classes of&lt;br/&gt;fields. Knight may acquire new students during the period of the&lt;br/&gt;grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of Knight's research, and that of students working with&lt;br/&gt;her, is to determine which aspects of mathematical structures are&lt;br/&gt;computable, and for those which are not computable, whether there&lt;br/&gt;is some nice, computable approximation. The grant will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate new work of this kind. There is a larger&lt;br/&gt;goal---enabling students to become first-rate research&lt;br/&gt;scientists. The grant will be used mainly for student travel and&lt;br/&gt;books. Without money for books, Knight's students would hardly&lt;br/&gt;own any. She has found that, given money to buy the most&lt;br/&gt;important references, her students read much more than they would&lt;br/&gt;otherwise. They see how the problems they are working on arose,&lt;br/&gt;and what their work means for the field as a whole. Knight's&lt;br/&gt;past students, and other logic students at Notre Dame, have&lt;br/&gt;benefited tremendously from opportunities to travel to meetings.&lt;br/&gt;They meet researchers from other universities and hear about new&lt;br/&gt;developments. As soon as they have results of their own, they&lt;br/&gt;give talks, and they get valuable suggestions. In short, they&lt;br/&gt;have the opportunity, as students, to join the community of&lt;br/&gt;research mathematicians.</AbstractNarration>
