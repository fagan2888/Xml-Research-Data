    <AbstractNarration>The Center for Cosmological Physics brings together astronomers and&lt;br/&gt;physicists, experimentalists and theorists, to address the most&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions in modern cosmology. It establishes an&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary environment essential to address the cross-disciplinary&lt;br/&gt;problems, thereby fostering an ideal climate for nurturing new talent&lt;br/&gt;(students and postdocs) and stimulating faculty and other senior&lt;br/&gt;scientists to think in different directions. Measurements of the remnants&lt;br/&gt;of the early universe will be performed by Center scientists; this data&lt;br/&gt;will be interpreted by them and center theorists to reconstruct the&lt;br/&gt;conditions and laws in effect at the earliest moments of the Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Experiments in Cosmology over the past decade have revealed phenomena&lt;br/&gt;which are simply not understandable in our "Standard Models." Thus they&lt;br/&gt;constitute important clues to the deepest secrets of nature. These&lt;br/&gt;include the fact that most of the matter in the Universe is "dark" and&lt;br/&gt;appears to only interact gravitationally; that most of the energy in the&lt;br/&gt;Universe is of a mysterious form whose dynamics is totally unknown; that&lt;br/&gt;points on the sky which have apparently never been in contact with each&lt;br/&gt;other have the same temperature to very high precision; and that there&lt;br/&gt;are particles striking the Earth with energies well beyond what we can&lt;br/&gt;understand. The Center exploits the interrelations among these phenomena&lt;br/&gt;and will address them with new experiments and new insights.</AbstractNarration>
