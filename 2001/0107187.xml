    <AbstractNarration>Krasny&lt;br/&gt;0107187&lt;br/&gt; The investigator develops new computer algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;particle simulations in fluid dynamics and molecular dynamics,&lt;br/&gt;and he employs the algorithms to study important application&lt;br/&gt;problems. The main technical tool is a new adaptive treecode&lt;br/&gt;algorithm for solving the N-body problem in the context of&lt;br/&gt;long-range particle interactions. In this algorithm, the particle&lt;br/&gt;forces or velocities are evaluated using Taylor approximation in&lt;br/&gt;Cartesian coordinates, and the necessary Taylor coefficients are&lt;br/&gt;computed by a recurrence relation. The adaptive features include&lt;br/&gt;a divide-and-conquer evaluation strategy, nonuniform rectangular&lt;br/&gt;clusters, variable order approximation, and a run-time choice&lt;br/&gt;between Taylor approximation and direct summation. The&lt;br/&gt;investigator develops an optimal strategy for choosing the&lt;br/&gt;parameters in the code, in order to maximize the accuracy and&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of the algorithm. The application problems to be&lt;br/&gt;studied in fluid dynamics include the onset of chaotic dynamics&lt;br/&gt;in vortex cores, high precision computation of vortex sheet&lt;br/&gt;roll-up and spiral formation in the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem, and&lt;br/&gt;breakdown and transition in vortex rings. An important component&lt;br/&gt;of the work is to compare regularized particle simulations with&lt;br/&gt;experiments and with genuine viscous flows computed by finite&lt;br/&gt;difference schemes. The application problems to be studied in&lt;br/&gt;molecular dynamics involve potential energy and force field&lt;br/&gt;evaluation for electrostatic interactions.&lt;br/&gt; The results of this research affect several areas of&lt;br/&gt;strategic national interest, including civil and military&lt;br/&gt;aviation and biotechnology. One outstanding problem in aviation&lt;br/&gt;is the simulation of the trailing vortex wake that forms behind&lt;br/&gt;an aircraft on takeoff and landing. The vortex wake is a serious&lt;br/&gt;hazard to other aircraft, especially in crowded airports. It&lt;br/&gt;imposes a minimum time and distance between takeoffs and landings&lt;br/&gt;on a given runway, and it is a source of wind shear, which has&lt;br/&gt;been implicated in accidents. The project sheds light on the&lt;br/&gt;structure and dynamics of vortex cores, and this helps&lt;br/&gt;aeronautical engineers in designing vortex wake remediation&lt;br/&gt;systems. In the area of biotechnology, one far-reaching problem&lt;br/&gt;is to simulate protein folding in a physically accurate way. This&lt;br/&gt;is in fact the next step required to make use of the data&lt;br/&gt;collected in the human genome project. The project contributes by&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the computer algorithms that are used by biochemists to&lt;br/&gt;study protein folding. In the area of education and human&lt;br/&gt;resources, the investigator directs an applied honors calculus&lt;br/&gt;course for freshman science and engineering students, develops a&lt;br/&gt;new graduate course on scientific computing, and mentors the&lt;br/&gt;professional development of undergraduate and graduate students&lt;br/&gt;and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
