    <AbstractNarration>0110107&lt;br/&gt;Mohler&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the research proposed in this project is to elucidate mechanisms by which the head of the Drosophila larva is patterned during early embryogenesis. The mechanisms by which the segments of the head are specified are not well understood, but are clearly distinct from the mechanisms used to specify the segments of the trunk. The head segments are laid down considerably later than the trunk segments in a process independent of the pair-rule genes that combinatorially specify the trunk segmentation plan. Furthermore, unlike the trunk segments, segment identity of many of the head segments is conferred by non-homeobox containing transcription factors whose genes are not members of the HOX complex.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will specifically examine how the three cephalic segments (intercalary, antennal and ocular) are initially established, by examining the controls regulating the spatial expression of three segment polarity genes (wg, hh and en) that are essential for establishing segmentation in the Drosophila embryo. In addition, this research project will examine the molecular mechanisms by which the CNC/Maf-S bZIP transcription factor regulates segment identity in the labral and mandibular segments of the head. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the genes that are involved in segmentation of the Drosophila embryo, including those active in head segmentation, have homologs in most animal species. Analysis of the developmental roles of these genes in Drosophila head patterning and their interrelationships is likely to provide important developmental principles involved generally in animal embryology</AbstractNarration>
