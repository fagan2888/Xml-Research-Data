    <AbstractNarration>Tunable Radio-Frequency Electromagnetic Absorption In Ferrite Nanoparticles&lt;br/&gt;______________________________________________________________________&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to NSE, NSF-0019. Nanostructured materials display a wide variety of novel physical properties that can be used in producing tailored materials for device applications. Specifically, the RF and microwave response in these materials is of great interest as there exists the potential for achieving tunability and tailored electromagnetic response useful for specific applications. Demonstration of improved RF characteristics or discovery of new electromagnetic properties in nanomaterials would have a major impact on future development of a large class of devices like filters, phase shifters, circulators, isolators etc. that are commonly used in wireless and communication applications. &lt;br/&gt;The overall objective of this Nanoscale Exploratory Research project is to study the radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic absorption properties in ferrite nanoparticles. The PI will focus on g-Fe2O3 and the Ni-doped soft ferrites synthesized in collaboration with industry and would attempt to correlate the high frequency response with the underlying important parameters in ferrite nanoparticles like the particle size, nanostructure and magnetic behavior. In addition to magnetic susceptibility, hysteresis loops and frequency-dependent (up to 1 GHz) complex permeability measurements, a novel RF resonant technique developed by the PI will be employed to probe the magnetic anisotropy. &lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute to education and student training at the University of South Florida in a technologically challenging and important field. It further provides the opportunity for an Applied Physics graduate student to interact with materials engineers in industry and travel to the company site and participate in synthesis of ferrite nanopowders.</AbstractNarration>
