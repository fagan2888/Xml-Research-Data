    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0104139&lt;br/&gt;Mikhail G. Khovanov&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project aims to construct quantum invariants of &lt;br/&gt;4-dimensional objects. It is based on the author's recent &lt;br/&gt;discovery of a doubly-graded cohomology theory of links in &lt;br/&gt;the 3-sphere. The Euler characteristic of the cohomology &lt;br/&gt;groups is equal to the Jones polynomial. We would like to &lt;br/&gt;extend this theory to link cobordisms. The invariant of a &lt;br/&gt;cobordism will be a homomorphism between cohomology groups &lt;br/&gt;assigned to the boundaries of the cobordism. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;the theory should extend to tangles and tangle cobordisms. &lt;br/&gt;To a tangle we'll associate a functor between triangulated &lt;br/&gt;categories associated to the boundaries of the tangle, and &lt;br/&gt;to a tangle cobordism a natural transformation between functors. &lt;br/&gt;These triangulated categories will be related to highest weight&lt;br/&gt;categories of modules over simple Lie algebras, as well as &lt;br/&gt;categories of modules over certain Frobenius algebras, such &lt;br/&gt;as cyclotomic Hecke algebras. In addition, we will look for &lt;br/&gt;cohomology theories lifts of other quantum invariants of links &lt;br/&gt;and 3-manifolds, including the Alexander and HOMFLY polynomials &lt;br/&gt;and Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An n-dimensional manifold is an object that locally looks &lt;br/&gt;like an n-dimensional space. A circle can be approximated by &lt;br/&gt;a tangent line in the neighbourhood of a point, and is a &lt;br/&gt;one-dimensional manifold (n-manifold, for short). The global &lt;br/&gt;structure distinguishes the circle from the line, though. &lt;br/&gt;Surfaces provide examples of two-manifolds. It turns out that &lt;br/&gt;one and two-manifolds are easy to classify, while in higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensions classification is hard. It is a theorem that &lt;br/&gt;in dimensions greater than three there can be no satisfactory classification, and topologists seem to be fairly close to &lt;br/&gt;finding one for three-manifolds. Given a pair of manifolds, &lt;br/&gt;it is a tough question to decide whether or not they are &lt;br/&gt;isomorphic. One approach is to extract some tangible invariant &lt;br/&gt;out of a manifold, such as a number, or a polynomial, and then &lt;br/&gt;compare these numbers. Most of the times the numbers are different &lt;br/&gt;and tell us that the manifolds are different, too. Dimension &lt;br/&gt;three is special in that there is a wealth of such invariants. &lt;br/&gt;These invariants, moreover, link three-manifold topology with &lt;br/&gt;deep algebraic structures. There are indications that the &lt;br/&gt;invariants can be lifted to the next dimension, to invariants &lt;br/&gt;of four-manifolds, and my goal is to find them and compare to &lt;br/&gt;analytical invariants of 4-manifolds that arise from solutions of &lt;br/&gt;certain partial differential equations.</AbstractNarration>
