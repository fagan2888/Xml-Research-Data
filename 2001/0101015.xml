    <AbstractNarration>Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will include work on &lt;br/&gt;relating theoretical predictions to new experiments that will be performed &lt;br/&gt;in the near future, and to the development of ideas involving superstring &lt;br/&gt;theory, a theory of all fundamental interactions. The detection of dark &lt;br/&gt;matter, the mysterious non luminous material that appears to make up about &lt;br/&gt;90 % of our Milky Way galaxy, and the the recent exciting Brookhaven &lt;br/&gt;National Laboratory measurements that appear to indicate the existance of &lt;br/&gt;new physical phenomena will be analyzed, and a study will be made of how &lt;br/&gt;superstring models can account for the masses of elementary particles.&lt;br/&gt;The analyses of experimental predictions are of importance as a whole &lt;br/&gt;array of new experiments that will be able to discover the existence of &lt;br/&gt;new laws of physics in the high energy domain have now started or will &lt;br/&gt;start in the near future, and these experiments can be used to test new &lt;br/&gt;theories of nature and determine what these new laws are. The theoretical &lt;br/&gt;work on superstring theory is of importance as this theory is one of the &lt;br/&gt;main candidates for a new theory of all interactions including gravity, as &lt;br/&gt;well as representing a possible fundamental framework for cosmology.</AbstractNarration>
