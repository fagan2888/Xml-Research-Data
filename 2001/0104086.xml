    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0104086&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In his major project the investigator plans to continue his&lt;br/&gt;work on Riemannian manifolds with positive sectional curvature&lt;br/&gt;on open dense sets of points. A particular emphasis shall be&lt;br/&gt;put on the question how to distinguish this class from the two&lt;br/&gt;well studied classes of manifolds that have positive respectively&lt;br/&gt;nonnegative curvature everywhere. In further projects the &lt;br/&gt;investigator plans to obtain rigidity &lt;br/&gt;results for metric foliations of Euclidean spheres and for&lt;br/&gt;manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The surfaces of eggs and footballs or the idealized surface of&lt;br/&gt;the earth are examples of 2-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;positive sectional curvature. For more than a century geometers&lt;br/&gt;understand that surfaces with positive curvature must look simple.&lt;br/&gt;They can not develop any holes, so they look for example&lt;br/&gt;fundamentally different from the surface of a doughnut. In contrast&lt;br/&gt;there are two dimensional manifolds with nonnegative sectional&lt;br/&gt;curvature, which essentially look like the surface of a doughnut.&lt;br/&gt;This elementary observation reveals a fundamental difference&lt;br/&gt;between positive and nonnegative curvature. The main aim is to&lt;br/&gt;understand this fundamental difference and its implications in&lt;br/&gt;higher dimensions as well.</AbstractNarration>
