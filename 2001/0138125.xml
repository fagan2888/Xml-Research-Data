    <AbstractNarration>0138125&lt;br/&gt;Wilson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Naval Support Force Antarctica (familiar name: Operation Deep Freeze) was the major provider of station and field operations, logistics, and direct science support for NSF-funded research in Antarctica from 1954 until 31 March 1998, when the Department of Defense transferred military support of the U.S. Antarctic Program to the U.S. Air Force.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout its 44 years of existence, the Naval Support Force Antarctica produced and published annual end-of-season reports that contain authoritative narratives and statistics regarding its activities. The reports were published on paper; electronic copies do not exist.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collaboration of the Naval Research Laboratory Library, the Naval History Office, and NSF's Office of Polar Programs assembled a full set of paper copies of the reports. The Document Automation &amp; Production Service, Defense Logistics Agency, will digitize them and make CD-ROM copies. NSF will distribute the CD-ROMs as needed, and the files will be available to the public.</AbstractNarration>
