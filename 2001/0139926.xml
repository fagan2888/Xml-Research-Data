    <AbstractNarration>The importance of biogels in the function of biological&lt;br/&gt;systems is increasingly recognized, yet little theoretical work&lt;br/&gt;has been done to understand their behavior. Mathematics is&lt;br/&gt;well-suited to sorting out the interplay among the many forces&lt;br/&gt;(mechanical, electrochemical, and biochemical) that determine&lt;br/&gt;biogel structure and function. The investigators use&lt;br/&gt;mathematical tools to explore four closely related problems of&lt;br/&gt;biogel growth and dynamics, with an emphasis on pattern-forming&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms and the relationship between pattern and function.&lt;br/&gt;The four problems are biofilm and blood clot formation and&lt;br/&gt;function, gastric protection of the stomach, and the behavior of&lt;br/&gt;biogels in contact with a moving fluid. Models are developed to&lt;br/&gt;understand how physical properties such as the viscoelastic&lt;br/&gt;constitutive properties and the gel morphology are determined and&lt;br/&gt;controlled, and how these properties affect the biological&lt;br/&gt;function of the biogel. The investigators use analytical and&lt;br/&gt;computational tools to examine gel growth and dynamics on&lt;br/&gt;different scales using various models (continuum, discrete,&lt;br/&gt;isotropic, anisotropic), while attempting to incorporate what is&lt;br/&gt;known experimentally, and to expand the experimental database&lt;br/&gt;about specific biogel systems.&lt;br/&gt; Biogels are composites of water, filamentous protein&lt;br/&gt;networks, and other chemicals, and are increasingly recognized as&lt;br/&gt;having profound influence on the function of many biological&lt;br/&gt;systems. Important biological settings in which these biogels&lt;br/&gt;play a major role include blood clot formation,&lt;br/&gt;difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, and the proper&lt;br/&gt;protective functioning of the stomach lining. Improved&lt;br/&gt;understanding of how biogels are formed and how their properties&lt;br/&gt;are regulated is critical to understanding these important&lt;br/&gt;processes and how they can be manipulated to improve human&lt;br/&gt;health. Because the formation and regulation of biogels is&lt;br/&gt;governed by physical and chemical properties and because these&lt;br/&gt;properties can be expressed mathematically, mathematical tools&lt;br/&gt;can be brought to bear on these problems. Through mathematical&lt;br/&gt;analysis and computational simulations of biogels, a wealth of&lt;br/&gt;detailed data can be obtained that complements the data&lt;br/&gt;obtainable from traditional laboratory experiments. Hence the&lt;br/&gt;combination of mathematical and experimental investigators&lt;br/&gt;brought together in this project is expected to lead to important&lt;br/&gt;new insights about biogel behavior. The project includes&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, a bioengineer, and a biologist, and provides&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary research and training opportunities for&lt;br/&gt;students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>
