    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a novel photonic crystal defect cavity enhanced photodetector with wavelength selectivity, fast response speed, and low noise. By introducing photonic crystals into the design of a cavity enhanced photodetector, the problems associated with lattice matched reflector growth, low refractive index contrast, and heterojunction charge accumulation will be avoided. The photonic crystal defect cavity enhanced photodetector will be easy to fabricate and have superior performance compared with traditional detectors. The design can be expanded to photodetector arrays in many materials systems. Phase I will investigate the fabrication of photonic crystal defect cavity, characterize the photonic crystal band structure, and test p-i -n photodetector structures. Phase II would produce the prototype photodetector devices and optimize their performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel products utilizing a photonic crystal defect cavity enhanced photodetector are anticipated in optical communications and telecommunications. Since silicon (Si)-based photodetectors can be easily incorporated into Si-based integrated circuits, there will be immediate commercial application to the telecommunications industry. There is also long term potential application in imaging and optical communications.</AbstractNarration>
