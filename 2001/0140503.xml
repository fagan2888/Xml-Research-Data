    <AbstractNarration>The specifics of this project concern three directions which&lt;br/&gt;arose out of a general interest in definable equivalence&lt;br/&gt;relations. The first of these directions relates to the treeable&lt;br/&gt;equivalence relations. Following work of Adams and Kechris, we&lt;br/&gt;know that there is a mass of countable Borel equivalence&lt;br/&gt;relations which are mutually incomparable. No such result is&lt;br/&gt;known for the treeable Borel equivalence relations. We do not&lt;br/&gt;know whether there are infinitely many distinct examples, and we&lt;br/&gt;basically have only one established example which is not&lt;br/&gt;hyperfinite. More generally we do not know whether the implicit&lt;br/&gt;involvement of measure theoretic examples involving free actions&lt;br/&gt;of the free group is the sole obstruction to hyperfiniteness. The&lt;br/&gt;second direction of Hjorth's project concerns issues in the fine&lt;br/&gt;study of Borel complexities of countable isomorphism types in the&lt;br/&gt;topology of quantifier free logic, and may be connected with a&lt;br/&gt;translation of some basic concepts from first order logic into a&lt;br/&gt;quantifier free context. The third direction of the proposal is&lt;br/&gt;to investigate some combinatorial questions, such as having a&lt;br/&gt;model with a certain partition property for definable partitions,&lt;br/&gt;for infinitary sentences, especially those arising as the Scott&lt;br/&gt;sentence of some countable structure; this may be related to a&lt;br/&gt;still open problem posed by Shelah in the 1970's on the Hanf&lt;br/&gt;number up to the continuum for countably infinitary logic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In very general terms, this project can be located inside the&lt;br/&gt;branch of mathematics known as "descriptive set theory". This&lt;br/&gt;area arose around the end of 19th century as part of an effort to&lt;br/&gt;better understand the basic objects -- such as the real number&lt;br/&gt;line, real valued functions, subsets of the reals, subsets or&lt;br/&gt;regions of two dimensional and three dimensional space, the area&lt;br/&gt;or volume of such subsets -- which appear in calculus, and which&lt;br/&gt;are needed for applications in engineering, physics, and&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. Descriptive set theory does not itself&lt;br/&gt;actually address any of these eventual applications, but is&lt;br/&gt;rather preoccupied with purely foundational issues. Following&lt;br/&gt;Silver's theorem in the 1970's, many descriptive set theorists&lt;br/&gt;have become interested in equivalence relations on spaces such as&lt;br/&gt;the real number line, or two dimensional space, or similar&lt;br/&gt;classes of "topological spaces". The study of such equivalence&lt;br/&gt;relations leads to quotient objects which arise by considering&lt;br/&gt;the collection of all equivalence classes. For instance if we&lt;br/&gt;set two real numbers to be equivalent when the result of&lt;br/&gt;subtracting one from the other is an integer (i.e. a "whole&lt;br/&gt;number"), then the collection of equivalence classes may be&lt;br/&gt;naturally identified with the result of basically wrapping the&lt;br/&gt;real number line around itself, to obtain circle of circumference&lt;br/&gt;one. In this simple example the quotient object is easily&lt;br/&gt;understood, and has a geometrical representation. Most of the&lt;br/&gt;work in Hjorth's area deals with the so called "non-smooth"&lt;br/&gt;equivalence relations whose quotient objects do not admit such a&lt;br/&gt;representation, and the study of these quotient spaces is known&lt;br/&gt;to have connections with a variety of mathematical disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;such as "dynamics", and "ergodic theory", and some of the more&lt;br/&gt;abstract branches of "analysis", such as "infinite dimensional&lt;br/&gt;group representations".</AbstractNarration>
