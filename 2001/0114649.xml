    <AbstractNarration>The Wildlife Conservation Society/Bronx Zoo seeks NSF funding to develop an exciting &lt;br/&gt;new three-year program designed to engage girls and young women in science. Operated with the &lt;br/&gt;Girl Scouts of the USA, the National 4-H Council, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Girls Inc., &lt;br/&gt;and the Children's Aid Society, the program will reach thousands of girls across the U.S. over the &lt;br/&gt;grant period and thousands more thereafter. The WCS is uniquely qualified to run this program, &lt;br/&gt;having on its staff many women science professionals who are national and international leaders &lt;br/&gt;in their fields, and having conducted a number of pioneering programs for young women in the &lt;br/&gt;recent past. The 36-month program will consist of: &lt;br/&gt;- An Annual Earth Summit that will introduce 80 girls ages 14-17 to environmental science, &lt;br/&gt;including key environmental issues in regions across the U.S., as well as to careers and women &lt;br/&gt;role models in environmental science. (The girls will attend the Summit in teams of two or &lt;br/&gt;three.) &lt;br/&gt;-A series of service-learning projects through which the Earth Summit participants will be &lt;br/&gt;strongly encouraged to apply what they have learned in a community-based project that &lt;br/&gt;combines knowledge, service and reflection. &lt;br/&gt;-A program of technical assistance, through which the participants will be provided with &lt;br/&gt;ongoing assistance that will enable them to more effectively plan and implement their service- &lt;br/&gt;learning projects; and &lt;br/&gt;- A ``Virtual Club House,'' through which the girls will be able to communicate with each other &lt;br/&gt;and WCS staff about the program and environmental issues. The clubhouse will also showcase &lt;br/&gt;projects that the Earth Summit participants will conduct and explain how other young people &lt;br/&gt;might undertake similar community outreach and research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed program represents a unique means of increasing the participation of girls &lt;br/&gt;and young women in science. It will capitalize on the enthusiasm young people have for animals, &lt;br/&gt;nature, and for visiting informal science centers, such as the Bronx Zoo, to excite girls and young &lt;br/&gt;women about science learning. The program will also seek to increase involvement through a &lt;br/&gt;focus on ecology and environmental science, subjects that are of immediate relevance to students. &lt;br/&gt;With their world being increasingly altered by human activity, what happens to the environment &lt;br/&gt;is of tremendous importance to the daily lives of girls and young women today and will become &lt;br/&gt;even more so in the future. By focusing on content that is immediately relevant, we believe the &lt;br/&gt;program will significantly increase participant involvement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will build on a hugely successful Wildlife Science Careers Program that the &lt;br/&gt;Wildlife Conservation Society has been undertaking over the past three years in conjunction with &lt;br/&gt;the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York. This extremely popular program has involved 315 &lt;br/&gt;eighth- and ninth-grade Girl Scouts and trained many of them to introduce thousands of younger &lt;br/&gt;Girl Scouts in New York City to career opportunities in science. The new program will allow the &lt;br/&gt;WCS to reach girls across the U.S., to involve girls in science projects that will be of benefit to local &lt;br/&gt;communities, and to broaden the emphasis of the Wildlife Science Careers Program from science &lt;br/&gt;careers to a more general focus on environmental science and local environmental issues.</AbstractNarration>
