    <AbstractNarration>Catecholamines, such as dopamine and norepinephrine, are regulatory molecules produced by neurons and the adrenal gland. Recently, investigators discovered that selected cells of the immune system not only take up catecholamines, but also synthesize these molecules. There is no information, however, on the regulation of catecholamine synthesis and release in these cells. Furthermore, the functions of catecholamines released by immune cells are not clear. The goal of this project is to investigate the molecular regulation of catecholamine synthesis, storage, and release in the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and in peritoneal macrophages isolated from mice. The autocrine and paracrine actions of macrophage-derived catecholamines also will be investigated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Macrophages are important cells in the immune system, and catecholamines are important molecules produced by neural and endocrine cells. Based on new evidence that immune cells produce catecholamines, this project will explore the synthesis and function of these molecules in macrophages. Results of this study will contribute to our understanding of macrophage functions and provide clues to links between the nervous, endocrine and immune systems.</AbstractNarration>
