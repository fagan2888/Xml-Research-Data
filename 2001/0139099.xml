    <AbstractNarration>The School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program gives undergraduates the opportunity to participate in research at the forefront of knowledge of Physics. Participating students choose a research area in biophysics, cosmology/ astrophysics, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, particle physics, physics education, or space and planetary physics. These efforts are both theoretical and experimental but typically it is experimental research that is most accessible to undergraduates. For the 10 weeks of the program, students work closely with faculty, postdocs, and graduate students in an ongoing research program. In addition to the individualized research experience, the REU students have seminars to discuss other current directions in physics research with physics faculty, share their own work in seminars, learn practical skills useful in research, learn about the opportunities and challenges of further study in physics, and visit research laboratories.</AbstractNarration>
