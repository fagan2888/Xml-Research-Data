    <AbstractNarration>0125706&lt;br/&gt;Georgakakos&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the two-year research project is to quantify the relative&lt;br/&gt;importance of (a) the large-scale forcing fields of water vapor and&lt;br/&gt;thermal buoyancy versus (b) the storm microphysics for the development&lt;br/&gt;of the spatio-temporal characteristics of convective oceanic surface&lt;br/&gt;rainfall variability. Of particular interest is to understand the&lt;br/&gt;effects of cold microphysical properties on rainfall variability at&lt;br/&gt;various spatiotemporal domains and resolutions. The research studies&lt;br/&gt;oceanic rainfall as a first step toward the understanding of the causes&lt;br/&gt;of rainfall variability by separating the large scale forcing and&lt;br/&gt;microphysics from the complex terrain influences present in continental&lt;br/&gt;rainfall. The research results are of fundamental importance for&lt;br/&gt;hydrometeorology and hydrology, and they may be used in applications&lt;br/&gt;such as (a) downscaling or upscaling rainfall estimates obtained by&lt;br/&gt;remote sensing or by large-scale climate models, or (b) hydrologic&lt;br/&gt;design studies requiring rainfall estimates of high spatio-temporal&lt;br/&gt;resolution. Statistical-dynamical numerical models of rainfall genesis&lt;br/&gt;and evolution are combined with data from national large-scale&lt;br/&gt;experiments to achieve the goals of the project. State equations for&lt;br/&gt;the vertical momentum, mass and energy conservation are integrated&lt;br/&gt;efficiently using typical vertical profiles of the state variables,&lt;br/&gt;estimated from field experiments in convective regimes. A number of&lt;br/&gt;quantitative hypothesis are tested regarding the causes of rainfall&lt;br/&gt;variability in domains of a 256-km length, with spatial resolution of 1&lt;br/&gt;km and temporal resolution of 1 min. The models are used in a&lt;br/&gt;Monte-Carlo framework that incorporates uncertainties in observed data,&lt;br/&gt;large-scale forcing fields, and model microphysical parameterizations,&lt;br/&gt;including possible feedbacks from the generated cloud to the near field&lt;br/&gt;large-scale forcing.</AbstractNarration>
