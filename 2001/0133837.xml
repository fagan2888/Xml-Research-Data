    <AbstractNarration>Abstract &lt;br/&gt;CTS-0133837&lt;br/&gt;K. Mahesh, University of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is proposed to perform large eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent jets in cross-flow using unstructured grids. The problem is chosen because its applicability to a number of important technical problems such as fuel injectors, V/STOL aircraft, film cooling of turbine blades and etc. Furthermore such a flow cannot be correctly predicted by the current computational scheme of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS). Unstructured grids are chosen to allow mesh points to be localized near the jet boundary and near the wall. The method of computation will be based on a kinetic energy conserving scheme, which was developed by the PI. The results will be compared to existing experimental data. The LES scheme, once fully developed, will be applied to a range of other flows. The education plan involves development of new graduate courses, incorporate research component into both graduate and undergraduate courses, and including undergraduate students in research projects.</AbstractNarration>
