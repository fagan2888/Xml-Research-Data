    <AbstractNarration>The theory of automatic control has reached considerable maturity&lt;br/&gt;in the last few decades. Solutions to a large number of diverse&lt;br/&gt;and challenging problems have been obtained, and many important&lt;br/&gt;mathematical aspects of the theory are well understood. However,&lt;br/&gt;there remain several categories of problems for which the success&lt;br/&gt;of standard control tools has been limited. These include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1. Control of systems that cannot be stabilized by continuous&lt;br/&gt;feedback.&lt;br/&gt; 2. Control of systems with sensor or actuator&lt;br/&gt;constraints.&lt;br/&gt; 3. Control of systems with large-scale modeling&lt;br/&gt;uncertainty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The research and educational development plan&lt;br/&gt;proposed here is aimed at designing hybrid control&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. In this framework, a continuous-time process is&lt;br/&gt;controlled by means of logic-based switching among a family of&lt;br/&gt;regulators. The closed-loop system is then called hybrid&lt;br/&gt;because it combines continuous and discrete dynamics. We study&lt;br/&gt;several situations in which such a control paradigm is natural and&lt;br/&gt;helps overcome various shortcomings of more traditional control&lt;br/&gt;methodologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary focus of this research is on systematic development of&lt;br/&gt;tools for hybrid control design, applicable to general and useful&lt;br/&gt;classes of nonlinear dynamical systems. We propose to achieve this&lt;br/&gt;goal by recognizing common trends that unify different aspects of&lt;br/&gt;the problems under consideration, and by exploiting recent&lt;br/&gt;advances made by the proposer and collaborators in nonlinear&lt;br/&gt;disturbance attenuation and in stability analysis of switched&lt;br/&gt;systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid control techniques are suitable for implementation in the&lt;br/&gt;context of many important applications that drive the modern&lt;br/&gt;technology, such as software-enabled control, control over&lt;br/&gt;networks, and vision-based control. These methods help bridge the&lt;br/&gt;gap between the mathematical control theory and engineering&lt;br/&gt;practice. For this reason, they also generate high student&lt;br/&gt;interest. Our research program will be integrated into the&lt;br/&gt;academic curriculum of the Electrical and Computer Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Department of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;through course development, student mentoring, laboratory&lt;br/&gt;creation, and tutorial publications.</AbstractNarration>
