    <AbstractNarration>NSF Award Abstract - DMS-0138923&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences: Nonlinear Differential Equations, Mechanics and Bifurcation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0138923 Shearer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports U.S. participants in the conference on Nonlinear Differential Equations, Mechanics, and Bifurcation held at Duke University on May 20-22, 2002. The purpose of the conference is to explore connections between the fields of ordinary and partial differential equations, mechanics and bifurcation, and industrial mathematics, and to encourage the involvement of young mathematical scientists in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;The speakers include established leaders in these fields, as well as promising young mathematicians and scientists. The meeting is a collaboration between the Research Triangle universities of Duke University, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central theme of the conference is the role of nonlinearity in physical systems, especially elasticity, granular materials, and fluid flow. The interplay between experiments, modeling, theoretical mechanics, mathematical analysis, numerical simulation, and industrial design has proved particularly fruitful in recent years. This conference brings together scientists and mathematicians from all of these areas. The conference is designed to include lively discussion of the interplay between discoveries of new experimental phenomena, proposed mathematical models, theoretical developments and challenges, and corresponding innovations in numerical methods. Bifurcation and pattern formation are observed in experiments with solids, fluids and granular materials, and the mathematical techniques to analyze phenomena have grown quite sophisticated. This connection between experiment and theory, coupled to numerical simulation, occurs throughout the conference.</AbstractNarration>
