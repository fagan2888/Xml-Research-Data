    <AbstractNarration>Leucine zippers are formed when a pair of short alpha -helices in a pair of protein molecules bind in a&lt;br/&gt;configuration called a coiled coil. Leucine zippers and other coiled coils are abundant in nature;&lt;br/&gt;they are found in about 10% of all proteins encoded in typical genomes, including many important&lt;br/&gt;transcription factors. The project addresses two complementary questions about leucine zippers.&lt;br/&gt;First, how do the subunit interactions in the context of a specific leucine zipper from the yeast&lt;br/&gt;transcription factor GCN4, control the specificity and stability of zipper assembly. Different&lt;br/&gt;interactions will be engineered into the GCN4 leucine zipper and characterized by biophysical&lt;br/&gt;assays including equilibrium and stopped-flow circular dichroism, sedimentation equilibrium, and&lt;br/&gt;X-ray crystallography. In addition, new biophysical assays for leucine zipper assembly will be&lt;br/&gt;implemented based on analytical ultracentrifugation and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;Second, the project will explore the diversity of coiled coils in a whole genome. Using powerful&lt;br/&gt;genetic methods, the project will examine the specificity of interactions among hundreds of&lt;br/&gt;naturally occurring, predicted coiled-coils from the yeast genome that must coexist in the same cell.&lt;br/&gt;Because of their small size and simple, repetitive structures, leucine zippers have provided useful&lt;br/&gt;models for studying general issues in how proteins fold. By combining research on specific&lt;br/&gt;interactions with genome-wide studies of the properties of many zippers, this project will test&lt;br/&gt;whether our understanding of protein foldin is sufficient to illuminate the biology of a large and&lt;br/&gt;widely distributed class of important proteins.</AbstractNarration>
