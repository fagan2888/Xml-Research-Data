    <AbstractNarration>In recent years, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes have been shown&lt;br/&gt;to have the power to perform within thousandths of decibels of the&lt;br/&gt;Shannon channel capacity of memoryless communications channels. This&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to answer a natural question: how good are these codes&lt;br/&gt;for transmission over channels with memory? The channels under&lt;br/&gt;consideration are Markovian memory channels, including both channels&lt;br/&gt;where the memory is dependent and independent of the transmitted&lt;br/&gt;symbols. Such channels arise in several applications, such as disk&lt;br/&gt;drives or other storage media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The analysis and design of LDPC codes has benefited from representing&lt;br/&gt;these codes as graphs, where the decoding is done by passing messages&lt;br/&gt;along the graph edges. This graph model allows an analysis using&lt;br/&gt;martingales that underlies recent advances, including the density&lt;br/&gt;evolution design technique. The investigators study how to extend&lt;br/&gt;this graphical modeling approach to channels with memory. More&lt;br/&gt;specifically, the project is divided into four major tasks: &lt;br/&gt;designing density evolution algorithms under new channel models;&lt;br/&gt;evaluating noise tolerance thresholds; engineering codes for short&lt;br/&gt;block lengths and rapid decoding; and achieving spectral shaping with&lt;br/&gt;low-density parity-check codes.</AbstractNarration>
