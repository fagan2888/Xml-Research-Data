    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13) The Physics Department at Towson University is restructuring the calculus&lt;br/&gt;based general physics courses in order to a) provide a more effective learning&lt;br/&gt;environment for the students, b) provide appropriate course content in the service&lt;br/&gt;courses, c) increase the retention of declared physics majors in the general physics&lt;br/&gt;courses, and d) teach the general physics courses in such a manner so as to recruit&lt;br/&gt;additional students. This is accomplished by offering two sequences of calculus&lt;br/&gt;based general physics; one acts as a service course to other science disciplines, and&lt;br/&gt;the other is an Honors Physics course. The Honors Physics sequence not only&lt;br/&gt;has students from the Honors College enrolled, but all declared physics majors take&lt;br/&gt;the course. Placing the physics majors in a class&lt;br/&gt;with highly motivated, interested students such as from the honors college helps to&lt;br/&gt;increase the retention rate of the majors. Additionally, this low enrollment course is&lt;br/&gt;taught using adaptation of Workshop Physics techniques. This highly interactive, active learning&lt;br/&gt;environment has been demonstrated to be a more effective method of teaching physics&lt;br/&gt;than traditional lectures, and students are expected to retain their enthusiasm&lt;br/&gt;and interest in physics. Additionally, by separating the physics majors from the present&lt;br/&gt;calculus based general physics courses, the department can modify the content of the courses&lt;br/&gt;to suit the needs of the other science disciplines. Equipment is being used&lt;br/&gt;in both the Workshop Physics honors course and the regular general physic course. In the&lt;br/&gt;regular general physics course, the equipment allows the faculty to&lt;br/&gt;explore implementation of a calculus-based version of Realtime physics.</AbstractNarration>
