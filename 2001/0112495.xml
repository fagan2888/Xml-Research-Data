    <AbstractNarration>Proposal #0122495&lt;br/&gt;Florida State University&lt;br/&gt;Van Hoeij, Mark&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A one day meeting, an East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD), will be held at Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, on Saturday, May 5, 2001. The meeting is the eighth of the series, which has been held at a variety of US East Coast locations since 1994. We expect 60-80 participants will be from the computer algebra research community or interested in scientific/engineering applications of computer algebra, drawn from the eastern half of North America, but especially from the East Coast of the United States. The meeting includes invited talks and contributed poster/software demo sessions, covering the breadth of computer algebra: algorithms, software, and applications. We are requesting funding to cover travel expenses of US-based participants. The organizing committee intends to give preference to funding students and recent Ph.Ds who plan to make a presentation at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
