    <AbstractNarration>0123533&lt;br/&gt;Stone&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the first three years of the &lt;br/&gt;Intermountain/Southwest Conference on Industrial and Interdisciplinary &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics to be held at Utah State University, Colorado State &lt;br/&gt;University, and Arizona State University. The conference series, which &lt;br/&gt;will rotate among these institutions on an annual basis, would provide &lt;br/&gt;both a venue for the presentation of problems in industrial and &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary mathematics and a forum for the discussion of ways to &lt;br/&gt;broaden the traditional curriculum in order to prepare mathematicians for &lt;br/&gt;industrial and interdisciplinary positions. The conferences would bring &lt;br/&gt;together researchers from both academia and industry, enabling cross-&lt;br/&gt;fertilization between the programs in the Intermountain/Southwest &lt;br/&gt;region, and providing a venue for the students to present their work and &lt;br/&gt;interact with other students, faculty, and representatives from industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first of these annual meetings will be held at Utah State University &lt;br/&gt;in Logan, UT in February 2002. The two-day meeting will include &lt;br/&gt;sessions for invited talks by researchers from academia and industry, a &lt;br/&gt;round-table discussion involving faculty and industry representatives, &lt;br/&gt;sessions of shorter contributed talks and/or poster sessions, a special &lt;br/&gt;session involving only graduate students, and an informational session &lt;br/&gt;for undergraduates. The round-table discussion would focus on (a) &lt;br/&gt;integrating the needs of local industry into the mathematics curriculum &lt;br/&gt;and (b) current research activities in the region. For the first meeting, &lt;br/&gt;representatives from the Boeing Company have already agreed to attend &lt;br/&gt;and individuals at Motorola, Intel, IBM, and Hewlett Packard have been &lt;br/&gt;approached. Participation is also expected by faculty members from &lt;br/&gt;departments of physics, electrical and computer engineering, computer &lt;br/&gt;science, and industrial engineering. Faculty and students from other &lt;br/&gt;universities in the region and from broader areas will be invited to &lt;br/&gt;attend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference series will be jointly supported by the Applied &lt;br/&gt;Mathematics Program and the Infrastructure Program of the Division of &lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities &lt;br/&gt;of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
