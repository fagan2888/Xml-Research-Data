    <AbstractNarration>This project is establishing a collaboration, called Project Sun, among Brevard Community College (BCC), the Florida Solar Energy Center, Brevard Public Schools, the University of Central Florida, and the Astronauts Memorial Foundation. It increases the number and diversity of prospective K-12 teachers at BCC by providing opportunities to improve technological literacy, strengthen science and mathematics preparation, transfer seamlessly to a four-year program, and connect with business and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project are to:&lt;br/&gt;(a) improve the technological literacy of 150 pre- and in-service teachers by providing them an opportunity to learn technology applications in a hands-on workshop called the Sun Academy.&lt;br/&gt;(b) increase the knowledge of these pre- and in-service teachers about the use of workplace technologies in the classroom through follow-up learning opportunities during the academic year.&lt;br/&gt;(c) increase by 10% the number of prospective K-12 teacher enrolling in the community college while also increasing diversity.&lt;br/&gt;(d) facilitate a smooth and seamless transition for community college students to four-year teacher preparation programs through articulation partnerships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the academic year, participants work in elementary school classrooms, evaluating how students learn from Solar Matters, an online solar energy curriculum unit, and the Sun Kids Website. An Inquiry Group is forming an online discussion group, developing mentoring relationships, posting lessons and observations to the Website, and meeting annually to review the effectiveness of student learning. Participants also visit the Florida Solar Energy Center and the University of Central Florida Instructional Technology Resource Center.</AbstractNarration>
