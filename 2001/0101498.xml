    <AbstractNarration>Major challenges face the Northwest and the nation both in sustaining environments and economies and in developing educational programs to meet present and emerging needs. Natural resources and resource-based economies are severely threatened; restoration and conservation based on ecosystems approaches must be implemented through public-private partnerships supported by education programs developed in concert with new land management efforts. As an Advanced Technological Education (ATE) focal point, the Northwest Center for Sustainable Resources (NCSR) is transforming two-year community college programs to meet the needs of the technological, high performance workplace in natural resource management. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center is:&lt;br/&gt;(a) marketing and distributing curriculum projects and clearinghouse materials both in traditional formats and electronically through the Center's website.&lt;br/&gt;(b) offering faculty development institutes for high school teachers (NCSR's Natural Resources Institute) and community college instructors (NCSR's Ecosystem Institute and GIS Institute).&lt;br/&gt;(c) developing and delivering new NCSR Adaptation Institutes to provide frameworks for curriculum adaptation for community colleges and high schools across the nation.&lt;br/&gt;(d) disseminating the Center's model partnership approach through institutes and presentations; emphasizing employer connections and infusion of industry and professional standards into technician education programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is building on successful Center activities including the development and beta-testing of over 30 courses; production of materials, newsletters, reports, and a Website; and the offering of over 20 faculty development institutes.</AbstractNarration>
