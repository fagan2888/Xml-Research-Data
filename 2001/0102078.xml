    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Microbial Biology for FY2001. The fellowship supports training and research on the basic biology of protozoan, microalgal, fungal, archaeal, bacterial and viral species that are not generally considered to be model organisms. Further, it provides opportunities for a recent doctoral recipients to obtain additional training in microbial biology, to gain research experience under the sponsorship of established scientists, and to broaden his/her scientific horizons beyond the research experiences during the undergraduate and graduate training. These fellowships are further designed to assist new scientists to direct their research efforts across traditional disciplinary lines and to avail themselves of unique research resources, sites, and facilities, including foreign locations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan is entitled "Genetic Diversity in Benzoate Degrading Denitrifying Bacteria and Environmental Samples." Genetic diversity of 16S rRNA, nitrite reductase, and benzoyl-CoA reductase in bacteria capable of degrading benzoate under denitrifying conditions are being investigated with bacterial pure cultures isolated from estuarine sediments of a contaminated landfill site. In addition, DNAs will be extracted directly from the same sediment and environmental DNA clonal libraries (metagenome library) will be constructed to link the different kind of genetic information obtained from 16S rRNA genes and functional genes involved in benzoate degradation and denitrification in the environment.</AbstractNarration>
