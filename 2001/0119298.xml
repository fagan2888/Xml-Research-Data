    <AbstractNarration>0119298&lt;br/&gt;Ishman&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas award will support a planning visit by Dr. Scott E. Ishman of Southern Illinois University-Carbondale to finalize a cooperative research project with Drs. Ruben E. Martinez of the National Museum of Natural History, Rodolfo Martinez of San Pedro Nolasco College and Luis A. Chirino of Museo Fonck, all in Chile, respectively. The researchers will meet in Antofagasta and Santiago, Chile and will do site visits to localities in the Mejillones region of Chile.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The northern region of Chile provides a unique geographic setting to investigate the oceanographic and climatic sensitivity of the eastern South Pacific to significant changes in Antarctic ice volume change as interpreted from sea-level records. The Mejillones Basin is ideal for this research. It represents a shallow marine setting developed on an active margin with nearby volcanism and other significant tectonic features. Results from this proposed project will provide a better understanding of the interconnection between Antarctic ice volume change, oceanographic and atmospheric circulation, and the impacts these have on recurring oceanographic and meteorological events such as El Nino, which have global and economic significance.</AbstractNarration>
