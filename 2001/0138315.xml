    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for an investigation of the normal subgroup&lt;br/&gt;structure of groups of rational points of algebraic groups over&lt;br/&gt;general as well as over special (primarily, global) fields. The&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator attempts to prove a new conjecture on&lt;br/&gt;solvability of finite quotients of the groups of rational points of&lt;br/&gt;simple algebraic groups over arbitrary infinite fields.&lt;br/&gt;He also plans to analyze finite quotients of the multiplicative group&lt;br/&gt;of a finite dimensional division algebra in order to obtain their&lt;br/&gt;reasonable classification. Another central problem is investigation&lt;br/&gt;of the Margulis-Platonov conjecture for special unitary groups over&lt;br/&gt;global fields. The principal investigator collaborates on these problems&lt;br/&gt;with Gopal Prasad, Yoav Segev and Gary Seitz. He also plans to work&lt;br/&gt;with Gopal Prasad on a joint book project in the congruence subgroup&lt;br/&gt;problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions related to the normal subgroup structure of linear groups&lt;br/&gt;have historical roots in the 19th century (Galois, Jordan, Dixon),&lt;br/&gt;and have been an area of active research in the 20th century. Recently,&lt;br/&gt;new techniques for analyzing this problem for anisotropic groups&lt;br/&gt;over general fields have been discovered in the joint work of the&lt;br/&gt;principal investigator with Y.Segev and G.Seitz. These techniques enable&lt;br/&gt;one to investigate groups over general fields using methods of the&lt;br/&gt;theory of valuations, which were previously used only in the&lt;br/&gt;number-theoretic setting of global fields. This approach fits into&lt;br/&gt;the general area of investigation of the congruence subgroup problem,&lt;br/&gt;which is connected with other fundamental problems in number theory,&lt;br/&gt;currently applied in data transmission, data processing and communication&lt;br/&gt;systems.</AbstractNarration>
