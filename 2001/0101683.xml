    <AbstractNarration>This project is building on prior efforts of the American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC) in the area of teacher preparation to:&lt;br/&gt; (a) elevate awareness among two-year college mathematics faculty of the role two-year colleges play in teacher preparation;&lt;br/&gt; (b) identify and promote model programs that use appropriate technology as a foundation piece of the teacher preparation coursework in the first two years of college;&lt;br/&gt; (c) broaden the information base by collecting data on the nature of mathematics coursework and the appropriate use of technology at two-year colleges for preservice teacher;&lt;br/&gt; (d) strengthen collaborative bonds between two- and four-year colleges and feature successful collaborations;&lt;br/&gt; (e) equip two-year college mathematics faculty to strengthen teacher preparation initiatives at their colleges; and &lt;br/&gt; (f) disseminate information about effective two-year college strategies in the areas of early field experiences for preservice teachers, the appropriate use of technology, mathematics content for preservice teachers, and recruitment of prospective teachers, particularly minorities and underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the three-year program is holding four regional conferences that highlight the role of two-year colleges in teacher preparation. These conferences where best practices are being disseminated are being attended by teams who prepare action plans for improving preservice education at their own institutions. Two intensive summer institutes are being offered to address issues of content, technology, and pedagogy for prospective teachers. Capstones for the project are the creation of Traveling Workshops in Teacher Preparation and an extensive website of resource materials.</AbstractNarration>
