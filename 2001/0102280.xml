    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0102280&lt;br/&gt;Dey, Tamal K.&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CISE Postdoctoral Associates in Experimental Computer Science: Sampling Based Geometric Modeling&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many application domains ranging from engineering to medicine require the computer modeling of physical objects. Laser range scanners and other modern scanning devices are capable of sampling large numbers of points on the surface of a physical object. Computing a model of an object, often referred to as surface reconstruction, has received wide attention in recent years. In the proposed postdoctoral training and research project, the problem of how to perform surface reconstruction of a physical object from a set of sampled points will be further studied. Specifically, a postdoctoral associate will focus on extending the cocone algorithm to handle large, noisy, and undersampled sets of data points. The associate's research will contribute to building a software library that provides the reconstruction functionality needed to meet the widespread demands of a range of users across disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
