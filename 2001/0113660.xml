    <AbstractNarration>Disk systems have long been a source of performance and management&lt;br/&gt;problems, and they grow in importance as the years pass. Of particular&lt;br/&gt;concern are the slow-to-improve mechanical positioning delays. To&lt;br/&gt;address these problems, storage devices and host systems have abundant&lt;br/&gt;resources and knowledge. Independently, engineers of both device&lt;br/&gt;firmware and operating system (OS) software aggressively utilize their&lt;br/&gt;local knowledge and resources to mitigate disk performance problems.&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this research is to increase the cooperation&lt;br/&gt;between these two sets of engineers, which will increase the&lt;br/&gt;end-to-end performance and robustness of computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a deep understanding of available device&lt;br/&gt;and workload information and how it can be collectively exploited.&lt;br/&gt;Exploiting this understanding in real systems will require more&lt;br/&gt;expressive interfaces and new cooperative algorithms. Two concrete&lt;br/&gt;examples to be explored are: (1) device-side specializations, such&lt;br/&gt;as freeblock scheduling, that have access to system-provided&lt;br/&gt;information about priority levels and forthcoming demands, and&lt;br/&gt;(2) OS-side specializations, such as track-aligned extents, that&lt;br/&gt;have access to device-provided details about physical data layout&lt;br/&gt;and firmware cache algorithms. In addition, the insights generated&lt;br/&gt;by this research will assist end-to-end education and thinking in&lt;br/&gt;storage systems.</AbstractNarration>
