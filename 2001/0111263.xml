    <AbstractNarration>0111263&lt;br/&gt;Cetinkunt&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award is to support a collaborative project between Dr. Sabri Cetinkunt, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois and Dr. Magdy Abdelhameed, Design and Production Engineering Department, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. The goal is to develop new control systems for a nano-positioner mechanism (piezoelectric tool post) used in high precision machining, specially when machining brittle materials such as mirrors, silicon wafers and ceramics. The performance of control systems used in controlling the motion of a nano-positioner is crucial in maintaining a stable and accurate trajectory tracking. These investigators will develop new control algorithms based on neural network architectures. Specifically they will use Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) neural network architecture to improve the dynamic control performance. They will also design and implement a hardware setup for the mechatronics control system at the laboratory at Ain Shams University. This will include a Nano-positioner mechanism, sensing system, power amplifier of the PZT actuator and the real time controller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The project supports collaboration between two experienced investigators. The laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago has the required facilities. Dr. Cetinkunt has experience using neural net-based controllers for nanomachining and fast tool post machining operations. The Egyptian collaborator has an active research program in the dynamic and control of manufacturing systems, and an active research program in mechatronics. The project will include exchange of graduate students between the two universities. The proposal meets the INT objective of supporting collaborative research in areas of mutual interest. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.</AbstractNarration>
