Program. ENTRY POINT! a national effort to discover and develop talent among students with disabilities, seeks summer internship opportunities for students majoring in science, mathematics and engineering. Through the program academically prepared students have received quality internship assignments throughout federal government agencies and industry. Participants are exposed to various career options in the Federal sector that serve as a basis in helping students make informed career choices and solidify career objectives. By partnering with the Federal government, AAAS has been able to successfully place over 175 students in summer positions since ENTRY POINT! commenced in 1997. In an effort to continue its collaboration with AAAS, the National Science Foundation, one of two of the participating government agencies, will offer challenging assignments that will broaden the exposure of participants pursuing careers in science, mathematics, engineering and technology (SMET). Internship opportunities create an unique opportunity to assist in the fulfillment of two core strategies related the goals of NSF's mission: developing intellectual capital, and integrating research and education. As a result the Foundation actively participates in strengthening the infrastructure to achieve excellence in SMET education.</AbstractNarration>
