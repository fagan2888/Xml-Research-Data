    <AbstractNarration>0107687&lt;br/&gt;Williams&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposed is an innovative approach to solving the problem of visually unappealing base-station antennas. It seeks to examine how parts of existing buildings and structures might be used as transmitting and receiving antennas for these wireless applications. The major issues that must be solved to successfully develop antenna systems that are essentially invisible in a local environment include understanding&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- how to effectively exite existing structures&lt;br/&gt;- how to examine their basic radiation properties&lt;br/&gt;- how to predict their radiated fields&lt;br/&gt;- how to control their radiation characteristics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In some cases minor modifications may have to be made to the existing structure, but the visual impact of such actions would be minimal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Possible candidates for investigation include flashing and gutters around the tops of buildings, lightning protection systems, metallic window frames, building supports, power lines and supports, portions of existing towers and billboards, metal roofs or cupolas, and portions of the metal structure interior to a building.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The initial phase of the proposed research program will address the following tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- the development of appropriate feeding and matching techniques&lt;br/&gt;- the evaluation of the radiation properties for the proposed radiation elements&lt;br/&gt;- the investigation of the use of perturbing materials and modifications of the structures for current and pattern control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note, however, that these tasks are interrelated. Each must be accomplished to insure the success of the others. Hence, these efforts will be conducted concurrently. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of the successful implementation of such antenna systems on the world of telecommunications should be most significant. The final results of the proposed study&lt;br/&gt;should provide essential information on the feasibility of using existing structures as effective radiators, as well as providing preliminary tools and procedures for the design&lt;br/&gt;of these antenna systems.</AbstractNarration>
