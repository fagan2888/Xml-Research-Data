    <AbstractNarration>0139236&lt;br/&gt;Rosenthal&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Symposium on the Mathematical Theory of Networks &lt;br/&gt;and Systems (MTNS) is a major international conference. It attracts &lt;br/&gt;typically 400 mathematicians and other scientists working in theoretical &lt;br/&gt;aspects of systems theory. The symposium is interdisciplinary and attracts &lt;br/&gt;mathematicians, engineers and researchers working in all aspects of &lt;br/&gt;systems theory. Mathematical methods which play a role in the areas &lt;br/&gt;mentioned above stem from a broad range of fields of pure and applied &lt;br/&gt;mathematics, including ordinary and partial differential equations, real and &lt;br/&gt;complex analysis, numerical analysis, probability theory and stochastic &lt;br/&gt;analysis, operator theory, linear and commutative algebra as well as &lt;br/&gt;algebraic and differential geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In August 2002 the MTNS symposium will be held on the campus of the &lt;br/&gt;University of Notre Dame. Travel support will be provided by this award &lt;br/&gt;for approximately twenty new researchers (graduate students and recent &lt;br/&gt;doctoral recipients) and 2-3 international researchers needing special &lt;br/&gt;assistance to attend this conference. The symposium program will include &lt;br/&gt;plenary lectures, special topic invited lectures, mini-symposia, mini-&lt;br/&gt;courses, special topic sessions and contributed papers. The symposium &lt;br/&gt;will cover serious mathematical issues as well as some important applied &lt;br/&gt;areas. Several broad application areas were selected: (1) Systems theoretic &lt;br/&gt;questions in biology, (2) Applications in the area of telecommunications, &lt;br/&gt;(3) Computational questions arising in control and systems theory and (4) &lt;br/&gt;Systems theoretic questions in the area of mathematical finance. In each of &lt;br/&gt;these important application areas 2-3 established researchers were asked to &lt;br/&gt;organize a "Mini-symposium". This is a sub-symposium which typically &lt;br/&gt;consists of a sequence of tutorial lectures as well as a sequence of invited &lt;br/&gt;sessions each consisting of 4 research papers. The organizers had these &lt;br/&gt;areas of research in mind at the time the plenary speakers and the special &lt;br/&gt;topics speaker were selected.</AbstractNarration>
