    <AbstractNarration>The proposed activity aims to improve the recruitment and retention of women in&lt;br/&gt;engineering academia and to enhance career development of women engineering&lt;br/&gt;academics by addressing publications in refereed scholarly journals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop a CD ROM that demystifies the journal publication process.&lt;br/&gt;The CD ROM will contain both text material and digital video. An overview of how the&lt;br/&gt;system works and the differences, both in procedure and in impact, of journal articles,&lt;br/&gt;journal short papers, journal notes, refereed proceedings and book chapters will be&lt;br/&gt;documented in clear and general terms. How the editorial board of a journal operates&lt;br/&gt;from editor-in-chief down to individual reviewers will be explained with suggestions on&lt;br/&gt;how to become involved with a journal in an editorial capacity. Then, a set of best&lt;br/&gt;practices case studies that follow engineering papers from first submittal through&lt;br/&gt;publication will be included. These will take the user through the review and revision&lt;br/&gt;process step by step and at least one case study will involve a rejected paper that is&lt;br/&gt;successfully transformed for another journal. The video clips will provide comments and&lt;br/&gt;discussion by article authors, journal editors and reviewers, using women engineering&lt;br/&gt;academics where possible. While the focus is on journal papers, this CD ROM will&lt;br/&gt;assist the users in developing other peer reviewed publications including proposals.&lt;br/&gt;Dissemination will be in two phases and will be aligned with assessment efforts&lt;br/&gt;involving surveys and interviews. This project will benefit a large number of women&lt;br/&gt;academics and potential academics by addressing an issue vital to scholarly success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
