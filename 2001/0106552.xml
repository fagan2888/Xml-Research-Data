    <AbstractNarration>Organizations have knowledge. The knowledge is typically dispersed&lt;br/&gt;throughout the organization. Some of it is codified in documents and&lt;br/&gt;policies, some is embodied in projects and strategies, and some is tacitly&lt;br/&gt;held by individuals and small groups. The problem of knowledge management&lt;br/&gt;is that an organization's knowledge is often locally produced, haphazardly&lt;br/&gt;disseminated, and ineffectively indexed. It is inaccessible when and where&lt;br/&gt;it is needed. Knowledge management techniques take a participatory approach&lt;br/&gt;to identifying, codifying, and integrating knowledge resources throughout&lt;br/&gt;the organization. Their objective is to help people make sense of their&lt;br/&gt;organizations, to develop and maintain trust, to make commitments and take&lt;br/&gt;responsibility, to more effectively challenge, negotiate, and learn, and&lt;br/&gt;thereby to improve the quality of the contributions people make to their&lt;br/&gt;organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will adapt knowledge management concepts and techniques, and&lt;br/&gt;the information technology they employ, to understand and enhance knowledge&lt;br/&gt;management in school organizations. We will work with school&lt;br/&gt;administrators, but chiefly with teachers. First, we will investigate and&lt;br/&gt;characterize knowledge management practices as they exist today, and&lt;br/&gt;identify needs and opportunities to improve knowledge management. We will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate teacher-initiated development of organizational knowledge&lt;br/&gt;resources, and identify, and accessibly codify the critical knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;the school systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will assess the impact of this intervention on teachers, on the school&lt;br/&gt;system, and on the perception of the school by the community. We will&lt;br/&gt;compare and contrast this analysis and intervention to knowledge management&lt;br/&gt;interventions now becoming typical in business organizations.</AbstractNarration>
