    <AbstractNarration>0106561&lt;br/&gt;Wilcock&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bed surface coarsening, broadly termed armoring, is a pervasive feature of&lt;br/&gt;gravel rivers. Armoring strongly influences channel hydraulics, determines&lt;br/&gt;the population of grains available for transport, and defines the habitat&lt;br/&gt;for aquatic invertebrates, salmonid spawning, and juvenile fish. A general&lt;br/&gt;and predictive understanding of flow, transport, and benthic ecology in&lt;br/&gt;gravel-bed rivers requires an ability to predict the bed surface&lt;br/&gt;composition as a function of water and sediment supply. In general, the bed&lt;br/&gt;surface is not in equilibrium with contemporary conditions, so cause and&lt;br/&gt;effect cannot be deduced from simple correlations of field observations.&lt;br/&gt;Instead, we turn to the laboratory for controlled observations and to&lt;br/&gt;computational models to capture the varied and transient conditions in the&lt;br/&gt;field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations of armoring have been made for decades and algorithms capable&lt;br/&gt;of predicting armoring have been developed. Key elements are missing in&lt;br/&gt;both data and models, however, and the empirical and the theoretical have&lt;br/&gt;not yet merged into a complete model. This work aims to bridge that gap by&lt;br/&gt;building from both sides. On the empirical side, we will use a laboratory&lt;br/&gt;flume to make coupled observations of flow, transport, and bed surface&lt;br/&gt;composition in order to describe the evolution of surface and subsurface&lt;br/&gt;grain sizes with unprecedented spatial and temporal detail. On the&lt;br/&gt;theoretical side, we will develop a transport and armoring model that&lt;br/&gt;includes size-dependent vertical transfer of grains between surface and&lt;br/&gt;subsurface (kinematic sorting). This mechanism can be incorporated in&lt;br/&gt;current models, but the necessary transfer functions remain undefined and&lt;br/&gt;will be identified using the data from the experimental portion of this&lt;br/&gt;project. Testing of the model will be based on internal comparisons&lt;br/&gt;between different sediment supply configurations and a set of runs with&lt;br/&gt;progressive bed aggradation and degradation. The result will be a&lt;br/&gt;physically-based, tested model capable of predicting transport and armoring&lt;br/&gt;under the complex, transient conditions typical of the field.</AbstractNarration>
