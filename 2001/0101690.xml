    <AbstractNarration>This Research in Undergraduate Institution project at Western Washington University, a renewal of an earlier award, is to synthesize and characterize metal oxide-supported boride and phosphide catalysts to remove sulfur from organic sulfur compounds by hydrodesulfurization. This interdisciplinary project is jointly supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program in the Chemistry Division of the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Kinetics, Catalysis and Molecular Processes Program in the Division of Chemical Transport Systems of the Engineering Directorate. Professor Bussell and his students will prepare novel catalysts based on borides and phosphides of cobalt, nickel and molybdenum, and they will characterize them to optimize the catalyst synthesis and to determine the relationship between surface chemistries and catalytic properties. The research will introduce undergraduate and masters degree students to state of the art techniques in materials and surface chemistries, and will provide training to them in synthetic methods to prepare novel materials for heterogeneous catalysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide fundamental information for the design, synthesis, characterization and application of novel bimetallic systems for hydrodesulfurization by heterogeneous catalysis. Metal oxide based borides and phosphides of nickel, cobalt and molybdenum will be prepared and evaluated for the removal of sulfur from organosulfur compound for potential application in the removal of sulfur from crude oil and coal. In addition, the research program will provide a rich multidisciplinary education and training opportunity to undergraduate and masters degree students in material and surface chemistries.</AbstractNarration>
