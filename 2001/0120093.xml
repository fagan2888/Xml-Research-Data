    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Information Technology Workforce (ITWF)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Id: EIA-0120093&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dorothy T. Bennett and Cornelia Brunner&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Education Development Center (EDC)&lt;br/&gt;Title: Designing for Diversity: Investigating Electronic Games as Pathways for Girls into Information Technology Professions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides support for a 2-year study to research design criteria of electronic games that affirm and support 8-14 year old girls' positive notions of (Information Technology) IT professions. While much is known about general characteristics of games that appeal to girls and boys, there is a little information about the specific game design features, characteristics and problems that might successfully attract different children into IT. The study is expected to result in the development of specific design criteria for game designers and practical guidance for educators interested in using games to foster children's IT skills and interests.</AbstractNarration>
