    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Abstract &lt;br/&gt;David Kaiser, Program in Science, Technology, and Society/Department of Physics, MIT&lt;br/&gt;Training Scientists, Crafting Science: A Workshop for Putting Pedagogy on the Map for Science Studies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Questions of pedagogy, training, and the crafting of scientific research practices have usually fallen between the cracks separating traditional institutional and disciplinary studies on the one hand, and intellectual or conceptual studies on the other. A small but growing literature within the history, sociology, and anthropology of science, however, scrutinizes the intersection of these domains. This project involves a two-part workshop in order to probe the deep interrelations between scientists' training, learning, and research efforts --and to sharpen and consolidate this nascent segment of the science studies literature. The 19 participants in the workshop include several distinguished leaders in the field, together with many early-career scholars. The workshop convenes in Spring 2002 at MIT and again in Fall 2002, to discuss and analyze original pre-circulated papers. The discussions and papers are to be disseminated in an edited volume. The goals for the workshop and edited volume are twofold. First, this meeting should help solidify the small community of science-studies scholars who share interests in pedagogy, raining, and learning, thereby building connections between otherwise isolated case studies. Second, it is to catalyze the larger science-studies field to consider the constitutive roles played by pedagogy in making modern science happen.</AbstractNarration>
