    <AbstractNarration>0112193&lt;br/&gt;Atzmon&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Symposium on Metastable, Mechanically Alloyed and Nanocrystalline Materials (ISMANAM 2001) will be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, during 24-29 June 2001. Nanostructured materials (e.g., nanocrystals or nanoparticles) as well as amorphous and other metastable materials will be covered. Both fundamental issues and applications will be addressed. As a forum for novel ideas, the symposium is intended to promote contact between basic research and technological needs for industrial applications. The program will include invited and keynote lectures by internationally distinguished scientists as well as contributed papers, in either oral or poster presentations. The symposium proceedings will be published in the journal "Materials Science Forum." The symposium Web site (http://www.ners.engin.umich.edu/ISMANAM2001) has further details about the symposium. &lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;Research on nanostructured materials and amorphous and other metastable materials has increased as opportunities arise for industrial applications of these unusual materials.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
