    <AbstractNarration>Research and educational activities tied to biomaterials and bio-inspired materials are the theme of the career plan of the PI. A fundamental approach is followed towards design of composites of hydroxyapatite and polymers for development of new biomaterials for bone replacement. The new approach takes inspiration from biology. A molecular control of polymer-HAP interactions is attempted with synthetic macromolecules, mimicking the formation of biocomposites in nature. Experiments will involve vibrational microspectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy to elucidate the molecular interactions between polymeric additives and mineral components under simulated body fluid environments. These interactions and understanding their role on bulk macroscopic mechanical response of the composite to loading is the focus of these studies. This research will attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in formation of insitu composites and develop fundamental science based on this understanding to design composites with properties tailored for bone replacement. &lt;br/&gt;The educational activities proposed are very closely linked to the research. PI plans to 1.) Improve awareness of the biomaterials field at NDSU through a new course on biomaterials, summer research projects for undergraduate students and establishing a NDSU chapter of Materials Research Society. 2.) Stimulate interest in engineering and materials related research in middle school girls and 3.) Bring excitement of the materials and biomaterials field into middle school classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
