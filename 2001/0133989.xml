    <AbstractNarration>The broad aim of this project is to conduct research over a five-year period that investigates the link between visual representations and conceptual understanding of atoms and molecules in simple inorganic and organic molecules. Specific goals of the project are to investigate learners' understanding of simple inorganic and organic structures at the atomic and molecular levels, explore how visual spatial-ability relates to the formation of representations of atomic and molecular structure, and develop an Internet-deliverable, multimedia package that has instructional and assessment functions in promoting conceptual understanding of atomic/molecular structure through visualization. Specific objectives of the study are to survey student understanding of the difference between atoms and molecules at the microscopic level in relation to their understanding of elements and compounds at the macroscopic level, determine the conditions under which learners invoke the particle nature of matter when explaining chemical phenomena such as phase changes or chemical reactions, describe the nature of students' two-dimensional and three-dimensional understanding of atomic and molecular structure in simple molecules, determine the nature of the relationship between visual-spatial ability and the formation of representations of atomic and molecular structure, investigate the efficacy of visual-spatial training in the development of the particle nature of matter using handheld models and molecular modeling applications, and examine the effect of visual-spatial training using handheld models or molecular modeling software on the ability of students to alternate between two- and three-dimensional representations of molecules. Research methods include semi-structured interviews, paper-pencil and on-line tasks, and video recording of student performance. Subjects will be enrolled in chemistry courses for majors, non-majors, and for future elementary teachers. Results from the research will lead to a better understanding of the relationship between cognitive skills and conceptual development leading to improved curricular design and pedagogy in the chemistry classroom.</AbstractNarration>
