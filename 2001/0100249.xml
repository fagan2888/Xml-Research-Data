    <AbstractNarration>The proposer will continue the research that he has&lt;br/&gt;been pursuing under the support of the National Science Foundation. The&lt;br/&gt;specific areas of the proposed research include the following: (1)&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneous diagonalization of commuting tuples of self-adjoint operators&lt;br/&gt;modulo various norm ideals. This problem has been solved (with NSF&lt;br/&gt;support) in the case where the norm ideal is the Schatten p-class when p &lt;br/&gt;is strictly greater than 1. The proposer will next consider the case&lt;br/&gt;where p is 1, i.e., where the norm ideal is the trace class. This is&lt;br/&gt;a difficult problem, but this is also an important problem because of its&lt;br/&gt;potential applications. The proposer will also consider a class of&lt;br/&gt;ideals which are related to the Schatten class. (2) The complete&lt;br/&gt;determination of automorphisms of the full Toeplitz algebra on the unit&lt;br/&gt;circle which are induced by homeomorphisms of the circle. This has been&lt;br/&gt;accomplished under previous NSF support in the case where the&lt;br/&gt;homeomorphism in question is bi-Lipschitz. The final goal is to remove&lt;br/&gt;the bi-Lipschitz condition. This involves some careful estimates of norms&lt;br/&gt;in the Toeplitz algebra and the use of certain singular integral operators. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Toeplitz algebras associated with minimal flows. The ultimate goal&lt;br/&gt;here is to use K-theory to characterize the invertibility of systems of &lt;br/&gt;Toeplitz operators associated with such flows. (4) Hankel operators on&lt;br/&gt;certain reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces. Here the main question is the&lt;br/&gt;Schatten-class membership of these operator. The reproducing kernel&lt;br/&gt;will be involved in certain quantitative estimates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed problems are fairly representative of the current&lt;br/&gt;research interests in operator theory and operator algebras, which is a&lt;br/&gt;study of, among other things, the spectral properties of various linear&lt;br/&gt;operators. In part inspired and demanded by the development of the&lt;br/&gt;quantum theory in the early part of the 20th century, this study was&lt;br/&gt;initiated by great mathematicians such as H. Weyl and J. von Neumann.&lt;br/&gt;Because additivity (i.e., linearity) appears in many fundamental aspects &lt;br/&gt;of nature, operator theory provides the right mathematical tools for&lt;br/&gt;scientific fields ranging from atomic physics to optimal control. Many&lt;br/&gt;abstract problems in operator theory and operator algebras owe their&lt;br/&gt;origin to these fields of applications. For example, both for theoretical&lt;br/&gt;reasons and for practical applications, quite often one must deal with, &lt;br/&gt;or introduce, perturbations which are "small" by some measure or other.&lt;br/&gt;Problem (1) is about such perturbations. The root of this problem can be&lt;br/&gt;traced back to a paper of Weyl published in 1909, which asserts that a&lt;br/&gt;continuous spectrum can be turned into a discrete one by a compact &lt;br/&gt;(which a measure of "smallness") perturbation. Problem (2) requires both&lt;br/&gt;modern techniques and classical-style mathematical analysis. A theme&lt;br/&gt;which underlies all these problems is the establishment of various &lt;br/&gt;estimates (i.e., bounds or growth rates). In general, the sharper the&lt;br/&gt;estimates, the better theorems one obtains.</AbstractNarration>
