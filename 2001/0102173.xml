    <AbstractNarration>The investigator will study questions in the deformation&lt;br/&gt;theory of global Galois representations. Let a two&lt;br/&gt;dimensional mod p Galois representation be given.&lt;br/&gt;Serre has conjectured this representation "comes from"&lt;br/&gt;a modular form. His conjecture necessarily implies the mod p &lt;br/&gt;Galois representation is the mod p reduction of some p-adic&lt;br/&gt;Galois representation. The author plans to continue his&lt;br/&gt;study of whether such deformations exist independently of&lt;br/&gt;Serre's Conjecture, and if they can &lt;br/&gt;be arranged to be potentially semistable in the sense of Fontaine. &lt;br/&gt;Such constructions, especially combined with recent work of Taylor,&lt;br/&gt;could be regarded as providing evidence for Serre's Conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;There are interesting cases that are still open, such as reducible&lt;br/&gt;residual representations and representations of the absolute&lt;br/&gt;Galois group of totally real fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research falls under the general area of Number Theory,&lt;br/&gt;which has its roots in the study of whole numbers and their &lt;br/&gt;various properties. Natural questions that arise in this field, &lt;br/&gt;such as properties of prime numbers and how frequently they occur,&lt;br/&gt;can have applications to coding theory and cryptography. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;research is also related to Galois Theory, the study of symmetries&lt;br/&gt;of solutions to equations. Studying these symmetries&lt;br/&gt;can shed light on the understanding their solutions, a&lt;br/&gt;basic mathematical question.</AbstractNarration>
