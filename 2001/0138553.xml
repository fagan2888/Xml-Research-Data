    <AbstractNarration>Biochemistry and molecular biology employ methods from chemistry, physics, cell biology, microbiology, and genetics to study the structure and function of complex biomolecules. These functions include how they operate in living organisms and how alterations in these molecules perturb the living state. Biochemistry and molecular biology research integrates didactic and experimental material learned in many basic courses. This REU Site Program in Molecular Biosciences will continue to enable qualified undergraduates to do independent research projects using a variety of experimental approaches. The program is designed to offer the participants a variety of research areas from which to choose a meaningful and exciting independent study project. Students will learn how to formulate and test hypotheses and develop the ability to troubleshoot and problem-solve when confronted with the unexpected. They will have access to and training in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation. Through weekly meetings and a research poster presentation, students will develop the ability to communicate their results to their peers. The program will provide appropriate role models for these students to reinforce their excitement for a scientific research career and will emphasize to all participants the gender and diversity issues that impact research careers in science. For the past two years, through International Internships, the program has provided and will continue to provide the opportunity for undergraduates who demonstrate superior research aptitude to work in a foreign host laboratory on a collaborative research project for which they have received prior training. These students have learned to appreciate scientific research as an international endeavor and have helped strengthen international collaborative research projects. The program will assist participants in preparing applications to graduate schools and graduate fellowships.</AbstractNarration>
