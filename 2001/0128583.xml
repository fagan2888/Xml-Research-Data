    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate a design approach for a high energy density hydrogen/air Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell. The proposed research will demonstrate a means of creating sections of membrane, integral with the parent material, which are thermoplastic in nature and which are impermeable to hydrogen, oxygen and water for sealing edges. The same membrane modification will be used to create narrow, inerted sections of membrane to serve as borders of inactive membrane between segmented, series-connected, coplanar fuel cells. The material innovations will be demonstrated in actual 50 cm 2 PEM fuel cells, both single and segmented. Ionic conductivity and water and gas permeability will be determined to show the extent of inactivation in treated regions. Tensile strength tests will be conducted to demonstrate the integrity of the structures and the strength of thermally bonded edge seals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PEM segmented or coplanar have potential fuel cells applications where exceptionally long total service lives (&gt;30,000 Hrs) of operating times are required. Long service life is required for residential applications, battery replacement and standby power supplies for critical computer and control facilities.</AbstractNarration>
