    <AbstractNarration>0115362&lt;br/&gt;Feldhaus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports the US-India Workshop: Region and Regional Consciousness in India, Pune, India, December 2001. The conveners are PI Anne Feldhaus, Arizona State University and coPI Rajendra Vora, University of Pune, India. This symposium will bring together scholars from the humanities and social sciences that are researching various aspects of conceptualization and loyalty to regions in India. They will examine regions from differing disciplinary perspectives and a variety of scales with the goal of advancing understanding of ways in which people express, create, and foster a sense of their area as a distinct and coherent unit to which they belong. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The symposium will foster new institutional arrangements between Arizona State University and the University of Pune that will promote collaborative research in the near future including the convening of a follow-up symposium at Arizona State University, December 2003. This symposium will also provide an occasion for the founding of the Centre for the Study of Regions in Pune. Participants include senior and junior scholars, and recent Ph.Ds. This award is supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
