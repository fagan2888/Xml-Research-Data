    <AbstractNarration>0138275 &lt;br/&gt;Batarseh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This project supports a cooperative research project between Dr. Issa Batarseh, School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida and Dr. Ahmad Harb, Department of Electrical Engineering, Jordan University of Science and Technology in Irbid, Jordan. This project deals with bifurcation and chaos theory for power electronic circuits. Most of today's dynamic modeling methods applied in power electronic converters is based on either linear ripple approximation, assuming that the natural frequencies of the converter are well below the switching frequency, or on time-averaging the output or the duty ratio function, effectively eliminating the sampling effect of the switch. These methods fail to predict the system behavior at high frequencies. The accuracy of these models degrades as the modulation frequency approaches one-half the switching frequency; hence they fail to predict the instability occurring in this region of frequencies. The objective of this joint research project is to investigate the application of bifurcation theory to newly developed modern high frequency dc-dc converters. The project will focus on two groups of power electronic circuits: I) parallel-input/series-output two-module boost-derived DC-DC converter with mutually coupled output filter inductors, and II) Single-stage Power Factor Correction (PFC) circuits. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project enables the US and Jordanian scientists to pool their complementary expertise and resources in providing a new approach to analyzing the behavior of power electronics converter systems. One US graduate student from UCF will participate in this international collaborative project. The project meets the INT objective in supporting workshops where mutual benefits and dissemination of information is likely to result. This project is funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems.</AbstractNarration>
