    <AbstractNarration>This project develops certificate and associate degree programs in computer integrated manufacturing. It provides a seamless educational pathway from high school through the two year associate degree on to a baccalaureate engineering degree and career placement. It involves a regional partnership focused on recruiting and training women and non-traditional students to meet the technology workforce needs of the region. It builds on and adapts a site-based learning approach employed in a prior ATE project implemented in the regional high schools. The major activities include establishing computer integrated manufacturing options in existing courses and curricula, integration of technical experiences across the curriculum, establishing a center and lab to simulate projects prior to the site-based learning experience, outreach and recruitment, summer orientation and internships and a host of other support services. A compendium of all instructional materials is to be made available to others interested in developing similar programs in computer integrated manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
