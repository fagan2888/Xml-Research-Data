    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop an economical platform technology for producing well-dispersed polymer nanocomposite films. Emphasis has been placed on the mechanical property advantages of mixing nano-sized clay flakes into conventional polymers. Processing techniques include sol-gel, various vacuum-based deposition methods, physical mixing, gas phase synthesis, chemical synthesis, liquid dispersions, and mixed solvent casting. To overcome potential production problems, a low-cost alternative technology, the modified Combustion Chemical Vapor Deposition (CCVD) process can be utilized. The modified CCVD process allows for the incorporation of nanoparticles of various sizes, distributions, and types in the polymer matrix. As a test bed for this platform technology, nanocomposite films for light emitting diode (LED) with voltage dependent wavelength output will be synthesized for display applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial application of this project will be in the polymer based LED segment of the flat panel display market. A low-cost, voltage variable LED system that is less expensive to manufacture, more reliable and with a longer life-span could have a significant impact in capturing more of this market.</AbstractNarration>
