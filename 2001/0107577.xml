    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "The role of epigenetic signaling in the evolution of trait allometries: Integrating development with morphometrics." This series of studies is determining the proximate mechanisms by which morphological trait allometries evolve in insects, specifically the wings and bodies of butterflies . Changes in the shapes of, and allometries among, morphological traits are being produced by artificial selection. The response to selection is being quantified using statistical and morphometric methods developed by the Fellow.</AbstractNarration>
