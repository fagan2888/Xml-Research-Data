    <AbstractNarration>In the current climate of nationwide education reform, a strong movement is afoot to place inquiry at the&lt;br/&gt;center of science education. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the National Science Education&lt;br/&gt;Standards (National Research Council, 1996), which recommend that students be ieengaged in inquiryld&lt;br/&gt;that involves combining ioprocesses and scientific knowledge as they use scientific reasoning and critical&lt;br/&gt;thinking to develop their understanding of scienceln (p. 105). Clearly, if teachers are to promote&lt;br/&gt;meaningful learning as advocated by the Standards, some of their instructional practices will have to&lt;br/&gt;change, and such changes must be supported by strong, research-based professional development&lt;br/&gt;programs. The proposed study will document the ways in which specific professional development&lt;br/&gt;opportunities influence science teachers beliefs and knowledge and, consequently, their instructional&lt;br/&gt;practices.&lt;br/&gt;Several factors influence teachers instructional decisions, including their beliefs about the nature of&lt;br/&gt;science, their theories about teaching and learning, and their knowledge of scientific concepts. Through a&lt;br/&gt;series of week-long summer institutes, teams of elementary and middle school science teachers will gain&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry, the role of models in scientific inquiry, and various&lt;br/&gt;strategies for creating robust inquiry opportunities in diverse classrooms. Ongoing monthly meetings&lt;br/&gt;throughout the academic year will provide teacher teams with opportunities to discuss issues related to&lt;br/&gt;implementing inquiry pedagogy, share materials, and seek assistance with particular concerns.&lt;br/&gt;A variety of professional development interventions will be employed to help alter teachers beliefs and&lt;br/&gt;develop their knowledge about scientific inquiry and conceptual models. These interventions include:&lt;br/&gt;collaborative study of a theoretical framework describing scientific inquiry;&lt;br/&gt;eflective writing;&lt;br/&gt;ongoing collegial interactions; and&lt;br/&gt;quality curricular materials.&lt;br/&gt;The analytical method employed for the study will be that of the collective case study. One focus teacher&lt;br/&gt;from each teacher team will be the subject of a case study. Collectively, the case studies will be&lt;br/&gt;formulated to shed light on the processes that teachers undergo in their attempt to adopt inquiry pedagogy&lt;br/&gt;and the types of professional development and support that have positive influences on these processes.&lt;br/&gt;Qualitative data such as interview transcripts, field notes, and teacher journals will be examined using&lt;br/&gt;QSR NUD*IST, a theory-building qualitative analysis tool.&lt;br/&gt;It is undeniable that national and statewide reform initiatives, bolstered by renewed emphasis on&lt;br/&gt;standardized testing, are putting pressure on teachers to adopt inquiry-based instructional techniques.&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, utilizing inquiry-based curriculum materials and providing hands-on learning experiences&lt;br/&gt;in classrooms are not enough to enable students to ioengage in the same activities and thinking&lt;br/&gt;processes [italics added] as scientists who are seeking to expand human knowledge of the natural worldll&lt;br/&gt;(NRC, 2000, p. 1). To accomplish this tall task, teachers will need support in developing greater&lt;br/&gt;understanding about the nature of scientific inquiry and ways of implementing inquiry instruction into&lt;br/&gt;their classrooms. The proposed study will make an important contribution to our knowledge of how&lt;br/&gt;specific professional development opportunities enable teachers to adopt more inquiry-based practices.</AbstractNarration>
