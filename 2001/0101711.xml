    <AbstractNarration>This project is developing a fully interactive three-dimensional model of the fermentation process. The virtual reality biochemical processing plant has three levels of immersion and is targeted to run on a standard personal computer. This model places special emphasis on bioprocess technology workplace preparedness. Indian Hills and its partners - Iowa State University, Iowa BioDevelopment, Southeastern Iowa Accelerated Career Education Biotechnology Consortium, Bio-Link, Madison Area Technical College, Pennsylvania College of Technology, Iowa Equity Resource Center, and Iowa Department of Education are developing and disseminating best practices in biotechnology education and the use of virtual reality for instruction in complex technical fields. The virtual reality bioprocessing plant provides students with an unprecedented opportunity to "see" how a bioprocessor works from the inside out. In addition, the virtual plant accurately models the controls and response of the real plant so that students can explore cause and effect relationships without costly plant shut-downs or product loss. Prior to this project, only in-plant training was available to technicians entering this field, yet in-plant training is expensive and the student cannot fully examine hazardous, non-profitable or transient conditions. In contrast, 3-D modeling and synthetic environment technology offers an inexpensive and flexible first step to training new operators on the biochemical processing system. Students in the Indian Hills Associate in Applied Science Degree program in Bioprocess Technology are benefiting directly from the virtual reality bioprocessor experience which is integrated into a number of courses. In addition, this technology is being utilized in a variety of settings ranging from high school to university as the technology has applications to a number of fields including biochemistry, engineering, biophysics, microbiology, and computer science. Students utilizing the virtual reality bioprocessor, whether in the personal computer format or in full immersion environment with pincher gloves and goggles, are able to visualize and test the information that is presented, internalizing the lesson. This technology fills a major gap in the academic preparation, in-service training, and continuing education of technicians in the biotechnology industry.</AbstractNarration>
