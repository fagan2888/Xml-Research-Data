    <AbstractNarration>0125385 &lt;br/&gt;Ustad &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the University of South Dakota to support the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners of the award are the University of South Dakota (Lead Institution), Black Hills State University, Dakota State University, Northern State University, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, South Dakota State University, South Dakota Board of Regents, Forward Sioux Falls, Rapid City Economic Development, Genesis of Innovation for South Dakota, Genesis Equity Fund, LLC, Small Business High Technology Institute, South Dakota Health Research Foundation, Dairean, Inc., Pacer Corporation, South Dakota Health Technology Innovations, TJ Technologies, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Activities&lt;br/&gt;The activities include: (1) creation of a series of technology entrepreneurship education modules that will be integrated in science, math, engineering, and other subjects, (2) modify several existing business and entrepreneurship undergraduate and graduate courses to focus on technology and R&amp;D businesses, and (3) integrate university and private sector partners into technology evaluation and development teams to move innovations and technologies to market. Current innovation courses at the academic institutions are business-oriented with little science, engineering, and technology emphasis. This award will support integration of science and engineering with the business and management courses and establishment of offices for technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Innovation&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop the knowledge and skills needed by students, faculty, entrepreneurs, and private sector partners to start and expand technology-based businesses in the technology business incubators being developed in South Dakota. The project involves a collaborative effort between public universities and the private sector to facilitate technology transfer into viable technology and business. The project will educate and encourage new technology entrepreneurs to start and grow new businesses. The technology sectors being emphasized are biomedical sciences and health, materials, information technology/education, and biotechnology and agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The businesses formed will contribute to the economic wellbeing of South Dakota. Education of a workforce to fill positions in those businesses will be a priority. The six university campuses will lead as a source of new knowledge through research and a source of education for the businesses as well as in providing an entrepreneurial workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Societal Impact&lt;br/&gt;Creation of wealth and high-paying jobs for the citizens of South Dakota will be a major outcome. Indigenous Americans will also benefit from</AbstractNarration>
