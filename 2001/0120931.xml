    <AbstractNarration>The objectives of the Symposium on RNA Biology IV. RNA: Tool and Target are: To promote communication in a variety of research areas central to understanding the role of the structure and function of RNA in biological systems in a focused and intimate manner not obtainable at regular society, or other group meetings. To provide an educational experience for young investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students (especially women and minorities) in a setting conducive to open discussions with access to established investigators who have broad experience in all fields of RNA biology. To stimulate inclusive discussion and the sharing of ideas and techniques by postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, as well as principal researchers. To bring researchers to a venue where three major universities, federal research institutions and laboratories, and many corporate research centers are located. RNA research, especially&lt;br/&gt;RNA as target and tool, has spawned a dozen biotechnology companies in the US alone and has been funded extensively by several large, well-established corporations, including those in North Carolina's Research Triangle. This proposal requests funds to cover the costs of bringing several major speakers to the meeting, to cover the registration fees for selected young speakers and for covering some of operating expenses&lt;br/&gt;that will be incurred during the symposium.</AbstractNarration>
