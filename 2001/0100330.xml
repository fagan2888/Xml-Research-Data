    <AbstractNarration>One of the basic geometric and analytic problems in several complex &lt;br/&gt;variables is to determine when two real submanifolds in &lt;br/&gt;multidimensional complex space are locally biholomorphically &lt;br/&gt;equivalent. That is, when is it possible to find a local invertible &lt;br/&gt;holomorphic transformation sending one submanifold onto the other? &lt;br/&gt;This problem has attracted the attention of many mathematicians since &lt;br/&gt;the beginning of the twentieth century, starting with the work of &lt;br/&gt;Poincare and continuing with the major contributions of E. Cartan, &lt;br/&gt;Tanaka, Chern, Moser and others. The principal investigators will &lt;br/&gt;continue their research on several aspects of this problem. In &lt;br/&gt;particular, they will focus on determining when it is possible to &lt;br/&gt;reduce the biholomorphic equivalence problem to solving systems of &lt;br/&gt;polynomial equations with complex coefficients. They also plan to &lt;br/&gt;determine when a formal mapping sending a real submanifold into &lt;br/&gt;another is necessarily convergent. In addition, they will attempt to &lt;br/&gt;categorize those submanifolds for which such mappings are determined &lt;br/&gt;by finitely many derivatives at a given point. They expect that this &lt;br/&gt;study will lead to the discovery of new geometric, analytic, as well &lt;br/&gt;as algebraic invariants of these submanifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators will continue their study of fundamental &lt;br/&gt;properties of analytic and geometric objects, such as surfaces and &lt;br/&gt;curves, in multidimensional complex spaces. A complete classification &lt;br/&gt;of these mathematical objects can have important implications for a &lt;br/&gt;number of other questions in mathematical science. In fact, this &lt;br/&gt;study is motivated by the rich interplay between several areas of &lt;br/&gt;mathematics and physics, including control theory, string theory, and &lt;br/&gt;other areas of mathematical physics. Progress on the problems &lt;br/&gt;proposed by the Principal Investigators will likely have impact on &lt;br/&gt;the above-mentioned areas as well.</AbstractNarration>
