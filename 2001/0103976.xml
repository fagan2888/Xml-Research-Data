    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0103976&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Frank Quinn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project involves two distinct areas: 4-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;manifolds, and high-dimensional controlled topology. Recent&lt;br/&gt;successes with topological 4-manifolds suggest the time is ripe&lt;br/&gt;to try to formulate surgery obstructions for arbitrary&lt;br/&gt;fundamental groups. Improved understanding of handlebody&lt;br/&gt;structures and a new construction of topological field theories&lt;br/&gt;in dimension 4 offer hopes for combinatorially-defined invariants&lt;br/&gt;of smooth 4-manifolds. In the controlled area recent work with&lt;br/&gt;Ranicki has provided a proof of an elusive stability theorem for&lt;br/&gt;controlled surgery obstructions. This may point the way to a full&lt;br/&gt;description of the groups as generalized homology, analogous to&lt;br/&gt;earlier descriptions of the end and controlled h-cobordism&lt;br/&gt;obstructions. Such a description would have applications ranging&lt;br/&gt;from local structure in stratified sets to sharpening 2-torsion&lt;br/&gt;conclusions in some cases of the Novikov conjecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the boundary between the discrete and&lt;br/&gt;continuous worlds. Geometry and analysis (continuous points of&lt;br/&gt;view) have revealed strange behavior in dimension 4. In terms of&lt;br/&gt;the mathematics used in physics, other dimensions are "classical"&lt;br/&gt;while dimension 4 seems to be "quantum." Topologically&lt;br/&gt;4-dimensional objects are described in terms of 3-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;building blocks (a discrete point of view), particularly knots&lt;br/&gt;and links in 3-space. One objective is to bridge the gap between&lt;br/&gt;these two views, and in particular understand the quantum&lt;br/&gt;behavior from the topological point of view. In higher dimensions&lt;br/&gt;algebraic and qualitative topology (e.g. surgery theory) are&lt;br/&gt;discrete points of view. Twenty years ago the PI bridged the gap&lt;br/&gt;between this and local continuous topology in one case,&lt;br/&gt;"pseudoisotopy." This has had numerous applications. Many more&lt;br/&gt;applications await a widening of this bridge to include other&lt;br/&gt;cases, for instance algebraic K-theory and surgery, but the&lt;br/&gt;methods are complex and intensely technical and have so far&lt;br/&gt;resisted extension. The other objective of the project is to&lt;br/&gt;carry through these generalizations.</AbstractNarration>
