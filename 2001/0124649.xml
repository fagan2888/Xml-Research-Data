    <AbstractNarration>Since its inception as a formal program, one of the unique characteristics of the I/UCRC Program has been its commitment to a systematic and objective evaluation effort. As it has evolved over the years, the evaluation effort relies heavily on standardized collection of data by independent on-site evaluators at every IUCRC Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An evaluation system built upon a national network of local evaluators requires a considerable amount of support and coordination. Although the support and coordination provided by NSF staff and the "evaluators coordinating committee" are essential to the program's success, these mechanisms are not adequate to meet the needs of an evaluation project that has grown to be national in scope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is also being provided for a one-year project, "Quantifying Industry IUCRC Benefits" The project will attempt to develop quantitative measures of some of the benefits firms might receive via their participation in IUCRCs.</AbstractNarration>
