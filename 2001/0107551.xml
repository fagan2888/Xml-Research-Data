    <AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biological Informatics for FY2001. The fellowship supports research and training at the postdoctoral level at the intersection of biology and the informational, computational, mathematical, and statistical sciences. The goal of the fellowship is to provide training to a young scientist in preparation for a career in biological informatics in which research and education will be integrated. There is an increasing need for training in biological informatics at all occupational levels, and it is expected that Fellows trained through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research and training plan for this fellowship is entitled "Modeling the Effects of Hurricane and Fire Disturbances on the Population Dynamics of South Florida Slash Pine." Fires and hurricanes are frequent disturbances affecting community structure and dynamics of pine forests in the southeastern US. This research is developing spatially explicit, individual-based models of pine population dynamics, parameterized from empirical data that include hurricane and fire disturbances. The models are to be used to predict how pine populations will respond to hypothetical disturbance regimes associated with global change.</AbstractNarration>
