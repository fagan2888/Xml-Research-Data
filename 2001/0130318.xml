    <AbstractNarration>The Museum of Science in Boston is proposing to work with eight other science centers to investigate how science centers might collaborate to enhance the public understanding of research. The purpose of the planning effort is to identify and elaborate on promising approaches to increase the public understanding of the nature of scientific research, the process of technological innovation, and the interaction between science and technology and societal issues. Planning will be conducted in the context of three topics (tentative): global climate change, alternative energy sources, and genetically modified foods. Questions to be explored include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;what it would take for each science center to offer exhibits and presentations on all three topics,&lt;br/&gt;how can the exhibits be kept current,&lt;br/&gt;what is the best mechanism for keeping science centers informed about current research,&lt;br/&gt;what would motivate visitors to return in order to follow a single line of research,&lt;br/&gt;how can visitors best continue their connection with the science centers after their visits,&lt;br/&gt;what will science centers change in the way they develop exhibits and programs in order to present current science and technology,&lt;br/&gt;what costs and logistical factors will need to be taken into consideration,&lt;br/&gt;will "one size fit all" or will different designs be needed for different science centers, and&lt;br/&gt;how might the exhibits and programs be designed to encourage the incorporation of local resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will be coordinated with other media that are developing efforts to convey on-going science to the public. Evan Hadingham, Science Editor for NOVA at WGBH, will bring the perspective of television production; Rob Semper from the Exploratorium will represent the Internet; and Bruce Lowenstein, Editor of Public Understanding of Science, will represent print. The science centers participating in the planning effort include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Museum of Science, Boston&lt;br/&gt;New York Hall of Science&lt;br/&gt;Science Museum of Minnesota&lt;br/&gt;Arizona Science Center&lt;br/&gt;Tech Museum of Innovation&lt;br/&gt;California Science Center&lt;br/&gt;The Exploratorium&lt;br/&gt;Pacific Science Center&lt;br/&gt;American Museum of Natural History</AbstractNarration>
