    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0100710&lt;br/&gt;Nicholas J. Kuhn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Kuhn has a long record of developing &lt;br/&gt;methods to solve interesting problems in homotopy &lt;br/&gt;theory, K-theory, and representation theory. &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the largest part of this project is &lt;br/&gt;to connect new 'polynomial' resolutions of classic &lt;br/&gt;function spaces to other things: model categories of &lt;br/&gt;structured spectra, equivariant stable homotopy, &lt;br/&gt;classial loop space theory, and periodic homotopy. &lt;br/&gt;These connections will be used to calculate previously &lt;br/&gt;inaccessible cohomological invariants of both such &lt;br/&gt;function spaces and infinite loop spaces. A second &lt;br/&gt;part of the work is a continuation of the study of the &lt;br/&gt;generic representation theory of finite fields. &lt;br/&gt;In particular, from his homotopical/K-theoretic point &lt;br/&gt;of view, he is studying his newly discovered lattices &lt;br/&gt;of generalized Schur algebras, with an eye towards &lt;br/&gt;gaining insight about the modular representations of &lt;br/&gt;the finite permutation groups, and the finite general &lt;br/&gt;linear matrix groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Homotopy theory, K-theory, and representation theory &lt;br/&gt;are mathematical subjects in which one is trying to &lt;br/&gt;discover, and ultimately classify, fundamental building &lt;br/&gt;blocks of various sorts of mathematical structure. &lt;br/&gt;(This is quite analogous to a chemist studying simple &lt;br/&gt;molecular configurations, and how these can be assembled &lt;br/&gt;in more complex ways.) Homotopy is concerned with &lt;br/&gt;deformations of geometric objects such as higher &lt;br/&gt;dimensional surfaces. A sample hard problem is to &lt;br/&gt;understand the `shape' of all continuous functions &lt;br/&gt;from a sphere (surface of a ball) to itself. &lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is concerned with the algebraic &lt;br/&gt;symmetries of more rigid and discrete objects such &lt;br/&gt;as configurations of lines and planes. A sample hard &lt;br/&gt;problem is to understand all the basic ways in which &lt;br/&gt;the set of n by n matrices of 0's and 1's can act on &lt;br/&gt;strings of 0's and 1's. Finally K-theory is a &lt;br/&gt;sophisticated hybrid of the two. Professor Kuhn is &lt;br/&gt;studying new connections relating these subjects, by &lt;br/&gt;developing and using a variety of state-of-the-art &lt;br/&gt;algebraic and homotopy theoretic tools.</AbstractNarration>
