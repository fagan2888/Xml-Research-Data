    <AbstractNarration>Since 1998, The Evaluation Center at Western Michigan University has been conducting a project for Materials Development, Training and Support Services (MTS) through the support of the Division of Research, Evaluation and Communication. This award has permitted intensive evaluation training of faculty and advanced graduate students through summer institutes. In addition, a number of other training activities as well as support mechanisms for evaluators have been developed, such as training materials, an Evaluators' Directory, and checklists for evaluators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, the work of the Evaluation Center on MTS will continue. Forty-five participants will be trained during the summer, and 18 of these will continue on into internships during the following academic year. Additionally, a model for training evaluators will be developed and tested, including an instrument for testing knowledge and a self-assessment measure. There will also be training materials developed by participants that will be made available to the field. Finally, the web-site developed for evaluators will be enhanced and used more widely.</AbstractNarration>
