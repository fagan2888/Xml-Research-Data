    <AbstractNarration>0108541&lt;br/&gt;Hadly&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to use prehistoric information to test ideas about why animal populations are distributed as they are across modern landscapes. Geographic variation of modern species contributes to our understanding of population biology. The research is important because few opportunities exist to use historic samples to investigate population structure in naturally functioning ecosystems through time. This study will use fossil and modern specimens to trace two rodent species (pocket gophers and montane voles) through the last several thousand years in the northern Rocky Mountains. The work will reveal which aspects of a species' life history, such as dispersal ability, litter size and social organization, must be considered in the analysis of long-term population genetic data. The fossil deposits span several climatic warming and cooling events, thus providing a context for investigating species response to environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is the first in the burgeoning field of ancient DNA to analyze sequential fossil populations through thousands of years. In assessing genetic variation through time and across geographic space, this study will deepen our understanding of processes underlying the history and future survival of species. Results will provide a historical context for how mammals with different life histories respond to climatic change.</AbstractNarration>
