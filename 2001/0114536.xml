    <AbstractNarration>0114536&lt;br/&gt;Rose&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports a US-India cooperative research project entitled "A Comprehensive Digital Library of Stellar Spectra." The US PIs are Drs. James Rose, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and David Bell and Francisco Valdes of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO). With Indian counterparts Drs. Ranjan Gupta and Harinder Singh of the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCCA), they will work toward completing a comprehensive library of stellar spectra, obtained with the coude feed telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The library will consist of spectra for more than 1000 stars, covering a large range of atmospheric parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and metal-abundance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The library will be made publicly available through the NOAO archives. It will be a major resource for many investigators, given its unprecedented scope and quality in spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and coverage of stellar atmosphere parameters. The library will also be used by both the US and India investigators in their efforts to apply Artificial Neural Network techniques to the classification of stellar spectra and population synthesis of galaxy spectra. This award is supported by the Division of International Programs and the Division of Astronomical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;0114536&lt;br/&gt;Rose &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports US-India Cooperative Research: A Comprehensive Digital Library of Stellar Spectra.
