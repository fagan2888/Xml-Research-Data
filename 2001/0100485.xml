    <AbstractNarration>Lenstra&lt;br/&gt;0100485&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research belongs to the interface between number theory and&lt;br/&gt;algebra. It is inspired by problems that come up in an algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;context and in arithmetic algebraic geometry. Altogether, the proposal&lt;br/&gt;contains 19 problem sets: five from Algorithmic Number Theory, three&lt;br/&gt;from Algebraic Number Theory, five from Commutative and Homological&lt;br/&gt;Algebra, three from the Geometry of Numbers, and three from Group Theory.&lt;br/&gt;The collection has been composed with a view towards assisting the&lt;br/&gt;investigator's many current and future graduate students in choosing&lt;br/&gt;suitable thesis subjects. The problems have the appealing features of&lt;br/&gt;appearing to be feasible without being trivial, and of being specific&lt;br/&gt;without being narrow. They belong to mainstream areas that will also&lt;br/&gt;serve the students after obtaining their degrees. Of the nineteen&lt;br/&gt;problem sets, the following two are both easy to formulate and&lt;br/&gt;attractive. The first is the development of an algorithmic theory of&lt;br/&gt;quadratic forms over rings and fields of arithmetic interest. A typical&lt;br/&gt;question is how quickly one can find a representation of a positive&lt;br/&gt;integer as a sum of four squares. Or: it is known that any odd unimodular&lt;br/&gt;indefinite inner product space over the ring of integers is&lt;br/&gt;diagonalizable; given the symmetric matrix that defines the inner&lt;br/&gt;product, how quickly can one find the change of basis that diagonalizes&lt;br/&gt;the form? A first investigation shows that one may expect a wide spectrum&lt;br/&gt;of answers to the algorithmic questions in this area, displaying all the&lt;br/&gt;riches of number-theoretic algorithms. The second is giving class number&lt;br/&gt;estimates for orders in number fields. What is a good upper bound for the&lt;br/&gt;number of equivalence classes of fractional ideals of a giving order,&lt;br/&gt;expressed as a function of the degree and the discriminant of the order?&lt;br/&gt;And can one find better estimates for orders that have nice properties,&lt;br/&gt;such as being Gorenstein? This type of question is of importance in the&lt;br/&gt;theory of abelian varieties, and one will need to apply techniques coming&lt;br/&gt;from commutative algebra, abelian group theory, combinatorics, and&lt;br/&gt;elementary analytic number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to place the project in perspective one may consider the recent&lt;br/&gt;development of number theory. Present day number theory differs in two&lt;br/&gt;important respects from number theory twenty five years ago, namely in&lt;br/&gt;the roles played by algorithms and computers, and by algebraic geometry.&lt;br/&gt;It has been found that algorithmic number theory has important&lt;br/&gt;applications, notably in cryptography, and in addition number theorists&lt;br/&gt;have learned how to use computers for their research. Inventing good&lt;br/&gt;computational methods for number-theoretic problems has thus become of&lt;br/&gt;central importance. One of the principal investigator's strengths is in&lt;br/&gt;the interaction between theory and practice, on the one hand using recent&lt;br/&gt;theoretical advances for algorithmic purposes and on the other hand&lt;br/&gt;deriving purely mathematical inspiration from the problems suggested by&lt;br/&gt;the applications. At the other end of the spectrum, knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;algebraic geometry has become a standard requirement for aspiring number&lt;br/&gt;theorists. Virtually every breakthrough in number theory over the past&lt;br/&gt;few decades, including Andrew Wiles's work on Fermat's Last Theorem, has&lt;br/&gt;involved arithmetic algebraic geometry. Algebraic geometry depends on a&lt;br/&gt;broad spectrum of techniques from algebra and algebraic number theory,&lt;br/&gt;and gives rise to an unending array of tantalizing questions in those&lt;br/&gt;areas, of which the project studies a sample. What is maybe the most&lt;br/&gt;exciting of all, is the way in which arithmetic algebraic geometry and&lt;br/&gt;algorithmic number theory are presently being tied together, both in the&lt;br/&gt;application of geometric objects to cryptography and in the application&lt;br/&gt;of algorithmic techniques to investigate geometric objects in number&lt;br/&gt;theory. The project will be carried out by the investigator's graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, many of whom will, as experience shows, acquire combined&lt;br/&gt;expertise in these two areas, which is a very precious but fairly rare&lt;br/&gt;commodity.</AbstractNarration>
