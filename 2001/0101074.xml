    <AbstractNarration>0101074&lt;br/&gt;McDuff&lt;br/&gt;This award to University of Washington's School of Oceanography provides instrumentation to significantly improve the oceanographic research capabilities of the research vessels Barnes and Thompson, two ships operated by UW as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. It also provides instrumentation to UW that will be used to support scientific operations on USCG Healy, an icebreaker operated by USCG in support of NSF-funded Arctic research projects. The specific items supported with this award include an acoustic Doppler current profiler for coastal research on R/V Barnes, a plotter, copier and fiber-optic multiplexer for R/V Thompson, and deep-sea pingers and cryogenic freezers for research use by scientists on R/V Healy. These improvements will be of substantial advantage to marine scientists using these three ships in their research during 2001 and future years.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
