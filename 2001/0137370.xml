    <AbstractNarration>This award supports an American Physiological Society conference entitled "The Power Of Comparative Physiology: Evolution, Integration And Application," scheduled for August 24-28, 2002 in San Diego, California. The fundamental goal of this conference is to bring together comparative biologists who utilize a diversity of approaches including molecular, cellular, organ, and organismal physiology/biochemistry, functional morphology, biomechanics and biophysics, ecology and evolutionary biology to understand physiological processes and traits. The meeting will highlight the accomplishments that have occurred since the last large meeting on comparative physiology, and more importantly, will provide a forum to showcase new directions and approaches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Convene an internationally recognized interdisciplinary group of investigators to explore the rapid changes that comparative physiology has undergone as a result of the incorporation of a variety of new tools and technologies into the discipline; 2) Promote widespread participation of young scientists with an emphasis on women and under-represented minorities, through a travel award program; and 3) Interest new investigators and students in pursuing research using comparative approaches to understand physiological processes and traits.</AbstractNarration>
