    <AbstractNarration>DMS-0105256&lt;br/&gt;Kari Vilonen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the the work of the principal investigator &lt;br/&gt;is to develop geometric techniques for applications in &lt;br/&gt;representation theory and the geometric Langlands program. &lt;br/&gt;From this point of view the basic geometric problem is to &lt;br/&gt;understand perverse sheaves from the microlocal point of &lt;br/&gt;view. A sufficiently deep understanding of microlocal &lt;br/&gt;perverse sheaves on flag manifolds should lead to interesting invariants of irreducible representations of reductive &lt;br/&gt;Lie groups and, hopefully, in the end, to an understanding &lt;br/&gt;of unipotent representations. Similar techniques are also &lt;br/&gt;being applied to modular representation theory. The goal of &lt;br/&gt;the last project is to gain insight in the geometric Langlands conjecture in its various forms. In addition to microlocal &lt;br/&gt;techniques the point of view of Whittaker models is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental theme of the project is the interplay &lt;br/&gt;between geometry and representation theory. The idea of &lt;br/&gt;reducing the understanding of various geometries to their &lt;br/&gt;groups of symmetries goes back to Felix Klein at the end &lt;br/&gt;of the nineteenth century. From this point of view the &lt;br/&gt;basic objects, the "atoms" of the theory, are the &lt;br/&gt;irreducible representations of the group of symmetries &lt;br/&gt;of a given geometry. It turns out that these atoms arise &lt;br/&gt;from a particular geometric situation and hence we can &lt;br/&gt;apply geometric methods to analyze the properties of the &lt;br/&gt;irreducible representations. This is the goal of the &lt;br/&gt;first part of the the proposal. The second part of the &lt;br/&gt;project deals with the deep conjectures of Langlands. &lt;br/&gt;Here the geometry in question arises from an arithmetic &lt;br/&gt;situation and this brings number theory in the mixture of &lt;br/&gt;geometry and representation theory.</AbstractNarration>
