    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to develop a series of organic chemistry/spectroscopy experiments for the general chemistry laboratory that use organic chemistry students as peer mentors. Working in groups, the general chemistry students work on inquiry experiments that introduce them to UV-visible, IR, and NMR spectrometry. Using electronic tools such as e-mail and Web-based discussion boards, organic chemistry peer mentor groups collaborate on-line with the general chemistry students after the experiments, which helps the general chemistry students apply their newly learned knowledge. This portion of the project is adapted from the Physical Chemistry On-line project (NSF DUE-9950809). Because of the relative simplicity of C-13 spectra, we introduce NMR with C-13 rather than proton spectra. An upgrade of our existing Varian EM360 with an Anasazi EFT-GENII FT-NMR conversion package provides an instrument that allows us to do both proton and C-13 spectra. We also are using this spectrometer in our organic chemistry and advanced organic chemistry courses, and are adapting experiments from the Journal of Chemical Education that allow students to work in groups. The upgraded NMR completes the suite of instruments to which we introduce our undergraduate students at an early point in their careers. It also allows us to institute a peer-mentoring program, which we expect will enhance our students' communication skills and make organic chemistry more attractive to students who have finished general chemistry. The project serves as a model of how organic chemistry peer mentors can be used in general chemistry. We also are developing new experiments that introduce NMR to introductory students.</AbstractNarration>
