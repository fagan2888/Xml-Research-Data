    <AbstractNarration>The PI intends to continue the study of singularities of nonlinear heat&lt;br/&gt;equations in differential geometry and mathematical physics, such as The&lt;br/&gt;Ricci flow, Harmonic Map flow, Mean curvature flow, and the Porous medium&lt;br/&gt;equation. Possible singularities will be analyzed by means of matched&lt;br/&gt;asymptotic expansions.&lt;br/&gt; In addition to this the PI hopes to continue his collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;groups in medical imaging, serving at least as a source of theoretic&lt;br/&gt;knowledge for such groups and perhaps collaborating more intensely.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonlinear diffusion equations occur in many forms in mathematical physics&lt;br/&gt;and engineering, as well as in pure mathematics (differential geometry).&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of the solutions to such equations can be gained by studying&lt;br/&gt;their singularities. E.g. singularities of a solution to an equation&lt;br/&gt;modeling a chemical reaction in a reactor may correspond to explosion as&lt;br/&gt;opposed to steady reaction. The PI intends to study such singularities.&lt;br/&gt; In addition, the PI intends to continue his collaboration with a&lt;br/&gt;research group in Medical Imaging. The practical problems of how to&lt;br/&gt;automatically process 3D fMRI images all belong to a branch of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;called differential geometry. A detailed knowledge of differential geometry&lt;br/&gt;has proved to be very useful in medical imaging in the past, and promisses&lt;br/&gt;to stay important. Conversely, medical imaging problems may serve as a&lt;br/&gt;source of new mathematical problems and theories.</AbstractNarration>
