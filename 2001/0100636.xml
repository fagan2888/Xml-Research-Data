    <AbstractNarration>We propose an experimental and theoretical investigation of quantum interference current control (QUIC) in a number of large- and small-gap semiconductors. The investigations will include terahertz burst generation and detection using ultrashort laser pulses. We request funds for two graduate students and faculty summer salary. With prior NSF support, the basic theoretical concepts of the proposed experiments have been worked out, a well equipped, state-of-the-au ultrafast laser laboratory was set up, and preliminary experiments were conducted. With support committed by UNTvI / NASA's PURSUE (Preparation for University Research of Students in Undergraduate Education) program, one to two undergraduate/minority students will be involved in this project.</AbstractNarration>
