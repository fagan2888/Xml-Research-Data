    <AbstractNarration>Geometric Graph Theory is a new discipline at the borderline of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science which has been developed to deal with the fundamental problems that arise from the drawings of graphs. During the past 10 years Geometric Graph Theory has been effectively used to settle several important problems in combinatorial and computational geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference titled "Geometric Graph Theory" will be held at the University of North Texas in Denton from May 28, 2002 through June 1, 2002. Professor Janos Pach, a leading authority in this area, will be the principal lecturer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We expect that the conference will attract advanced researchers, as well as beginners and graduate students in all areas of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.</AbstractNarration>
