    <AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for construction of two bunkhouse-style dormitories, a small laboratory building, a dining/lecture hall and related physical improvements at the Indio Mountains Research Station (IMRS). Funds are also provided for a professional-grade weather station that will provide short and long term climatic information. The IMRS occupies 38,000-acres in the Chihuahua Desert of west Texas, adjacent to the U.S.- Mexican border. The station, which consists of a former ranch house with three rooms and a small storage building, is used by scientists, educators and students from the University of Texas at El Paso, Southwest Texas State University, University of New Mexico, Sul Ross State University, and El Paso Community College. Use of the station is currently at the level of 700 person-days per year, reflecting both research and educational uses. However, use is limited by the relatively primitive accommodations and lack of laboratory facilities on site. The planned improvements will allow the station to host researchers and provide education activities that require participants to reside at the station for several days at a time, and will improve the quality of work that can be done on site.</AbstractNarration>
