    <AbstractNarration>EAR-0106892&lt;br/&gt;Eugene D. Humphreys&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators address North America plate dynamics by modeling &lt;br/&gt;the forces applied to the&lt;br/&gt;plate and comparing the predicted stresses with those inferred from the style&lt;br/&gt;of ongoing tectonics and those observed in drill holes. Modeling is done with&lt;br/&gt;the finite element method. Input forces applied to modeled North America&lt;br/&gt;include boundary and basal forces, and those generated internal to the plate&lt;br/&gt;(arising from potential energy variations such as those created by topography).&lt;br/&gt;The relative magnitudes of applied forces are estimated to account for stress&lt;br/&gt;and deformation information. Furthermore, because the magnitude of many of the&lt;br/&gt;forces applied North America are well known a priori (such as ridge push), the&lt;br/&gt;magnitude of all the the applied forces will be well constrained. Tectonic&lt;br/&gt;stresses deform North America at a rate inversely proportional to its strength.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators model strength with a viscous rheology, which they &lt;br/&gt;estimate by ratioing the&lt;br/&gt;calculated stress with the (reasonably well known) strain rate.&lt;br/&gt;The research can be divided into several tasks: estimation of input fields,&lt;br/&gt;description of an appropriate finite element representation of North America,&lt;br/&gt;evaluation of model predictions against observables, and as modeling progresses&lt;br/&gt;toward resolving the input fields and assessment of their uniqueness.&lt;br/&gt;--</AbstractNarration>
