    <AbstractNarration>Old Dominion University (ODU) in collaboration with Norfolk Public Schools, Portsmouth City Public Schools and the Virginia Space Grant Consortium, seek to enhance existing resources for mathematics and science teachers and provide opportunities for graduate students to work with teachers from these two urban school districts. The program will allow ODU to place graduate students from the College of Engineering into 4th and 5th grade classrooms to support specially designated Master Teachers. The program will be integrated through the ODU College of Education, Center for Urban Education, Professional Development Schools (PDS) program which fosters joint inquiry into research problems by reviewing and revising curricula: drawing on shared expertise, co-teaching experiences; and through sharing insights with colleagues &lt;br/&gt;in the educational community. Teaching Fellows and Master Teachers will collaborate in this atmosphere through four professional development seminars designed to address applied mathematics, problem-solving, gender equity and inquiry based instruction in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. Hands on classroom activities, focused on inquiry and teamwork, will incorporate the Lego Control Laboratory as the tool to introduce elements of modern technology into the classroom. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
