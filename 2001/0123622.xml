    <AbstractNarration>The problem of under-representation of women in engineering and sciences is critical.&lt;br/&gt;This is particularly true of senior women in engineering. To address this urgent problem&lt;br/&gt;of under-representation and to meet the marketplace demand for the technological&lt;br/&gt;workforce in the 21 st century, a program is proposed that provides for mentoring and&lt;br/&gt;leadership development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Mentoring and Leadership Program is to sustain and broaden the existing&lt;br/&gt;initiatives at Syracuse University to promote the advancement of women faculty in&lt;br/&gt;engineering and sciences. Some of the existing initiatives are the brainchild of WISE,&lt;br/&gt;which the PI co-directs with the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and others&lt;br/&gt;are the direct results of the PI's Meredith Professorship initiatives. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;Mentoring and Leadership Program will capitalize on the existing initiatives and will &lt;br/&gt;introduce new features that reflect current knowledge of leadership development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ADVANCE Leadership Award will also enable the PI to maintain an active&lt;br/&gt;research program while she develops and implements initiatives aimed at the&lt;br/&gt;advancement of women students and faculty at Syracuse University.&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
