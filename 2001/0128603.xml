    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses security of operating systems. This approach is based on developing specifications that capture security-relevant behaviors of programs, and constraining their execution to ensure adherence to these specifications. Since all security-relevant operations are administered through system calls, program behaviors are modeled in terms of sequences of system calls made by them, together with their arguments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The system will achieve enhanced security without compromising on functionality by (a) being able to protect against known as well as novel kinds of attacks, (b) maintaining a very low false-alarm rate, and (c) reduced maintenance needs.</AbstractNarration>
