    <AbstractNarration>The principal investigator would like to continue his work on partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations and variational problems. The first theme of&lt;br/&gt;this project, and also of the research of the PI over the past several&lt;br/&gt;years, is to study special sets associated to solutions to differential&lt;br/&gt;equations and variational problems. The problems that the PI would&lt;br/&gt;continue to work on include the geometric structure of level sets, in&lt;br/&gt;particular the nodal sets and the singular sets. The study is partly&lt;br/&gt;motivated by the desire to understand to what extent the solutions can&lt;br/&gt;be described quantitatively by polynomials or by homogeneous solutions.&lt;br/&gt;These problems have a close connection with other fields in mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;including several complex variables and algebraic geometry. A new&lt;br/&gt;research trend is the study of the relation between the growth of nodal&lt;br/&gt;sets and the growth of solutions themselves. It is expected that they&lt;br/&gt;are closely related to each other. The second theme of this project is&lt;br/&gt;to study the isometric embedding of two-dimensional metrics in the three&lt;br/&gt;dimensional Euclidean space, both locally and globally. In general, the&lt;br/&gt;isometric embedding is based on the complicated Nash-Moser iteration,&lt;br/&gt;which requires detailed discussions of the linearized equations. Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;the global isometric embedding is expected to meet some topological&lt;br/&gt;obstacles. Difficulties arise when the Gaussian curvature changes its&lt;br/&gt;sign. Singular sets may appear even if the embedding exists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems of the singular sets originate from the material science&lt;br/&gt;and the control theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those&lt;br/&gt;sets where singularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to&lt;br/&gt;problems where they arise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate&lt;br/&gt;singular sets, the so-called "bad sets". An example is provided by&lt;br/&gt;cracks in the building material. Hence one of the central tasks is to&lt;br/&gt;investigate the conditions under which the singular sets can be&lt;br/&gt;controlled and hence can be made small. Another application involves&lt;br/&gt;the high-performance computing, in particular the image processing. One&lt;br/&gt;problem is to recover the image from a distorted copy and the difference&lt;br/&gt;is measured exactly by some singular sets. It is highly expected that&lt;br/&gt;such sets should be small enough to be neglected. The problems stated&lt;br/&gt;in the project are simplified mathematical models. It is the hope by&lt;br/&gt;the investigator that the discussion of these mathematical problems&lt;br/&gt;would improve the methods to control the singular sets in various&lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>
