    <AbstractNarration>This research program concerns several topics in stochastic control&lt;br/&gt;theory and related areas of applied probability and nonlinear partial&lt;br/&gt;differential equations. One topic is risk-sensitive control on an&lt;br/&gt;infinite time horizon, motivated by problems of robust feedback&lt;br/&gt;controller design for nonlinear systems. Another application of&lt;br/&gt;risk-sensitive control is in mathematical finance, including dynamic&lt;br/&gt;portfolio allocation problems on long time horizons. Yet another&lt;br/&gt;research topic concerns first order partial differential equations of&lt;br/&gt;Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type. While such equations are nonlinear in the&lt;br/&gt;usual sense, they are linear with respect to max-plus algebra&lt;br/&gt;operations. This allows for approximate solution via max-plus basis&lt;br/&gt;expansions. Finally stochastic control models for economic growth and&lt;br/&gt;debt which arise in international finance are being studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stochastic control provides a framework for modeling and analysis of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic decision making in the presence of uncertainty. The method of&lt;br/&gt;dynamic programming provides a way to obtain optimal stochastic control&lt;br/&gt;policies by solution of corresponding nonlinear partial differential&lt;br/&gt;equations. The research funded through this grant is motivated by a&lt;br/&gt;range of applications in engineering and financial economics, including&lt;br/&gt;robust feedback controller design, nonlinear estimation and filtering&lt;br/&gt;and optimal dynamic investment allocation. In international&lt;br/&gt;finance,growth/debt models are considered in which the goal is to choose&lt;br/&gt;national investment and consumption policies which optimize a suitably&lt;br/&gt;chosen criterion subject to imposed constraints. The model performance&lt;br/&gt;under optimal control may provide benchmarks to suggest whether actual&lt;br/&gt;current account deficits and levels of foreign debt are sustainable&lt;br/&gt;under current policies.</AbstractNarration>
