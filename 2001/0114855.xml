    <AbstractNarration>The partners of the Louis Stokes Missouri Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-MoAMP) are proposing to move the consortium into a Phase II initiative. The new phase focuses on increasing baccalaureate production by fifteen percent annually over a five-year period. A primary strategy proposed to support that objective is to include all four-year public institutions in the partnership for Phase II, increasing the collaborative by four institutions: Truman State University, Missouri Western State College, Missouri Southern State College, and Northwest Missouri State University. This addition is expected to increase participation by twenty-five percent. The alliance's baseline and degree target is adjusted to reflect this addition.</AbstractNarration>
