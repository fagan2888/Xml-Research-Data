    <AbstractNarration>The research proposed lies at the interface between measurable&lt;br/&gt;and topological dynamics. In these and other areas of dynamics&lt;br/&gt;the problems concerning the relationship between the dynamical&lt;br/&gt;and cohomological properties of systems proved to be very&lt;br/&gt;important. One circle of the proposed problems can be&lt;br/&gt;informally called "inverse problems for coboundaries", and,&lt;br/&gt;roughly speaking, is aimed to understand how and to what extent&lt;br/&gt;the dynamics of a measurable group action can be recovered&lt;br/&gt;from the cohomological information, and in particular, from the&lt;br/&gt;collection of all measurable coboundaries. It turns out that,&lt;br/&gt;in the case of group actions, the algebraic properties of the&lt;br/&gt;acting group play an important role. Another line of the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research is an attempt to get a complete understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the possibility of constructing minimal topological models&lt;br/&gt;for arbitrary families of measurable dynamical systems.&lt;br/&gt;In the case when the family consists of one single ergodic&lt;br/&gt;automorphism, the answer is given by the famous Jewett-Krieger&lt;br/&gt;theorem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classical theory of dynamical systems originated with the&lt;br/&gt;study of qualitative behavior of the solutions of differential&lt;br/&gt;equations describing the motion of a mechanical system. The&lt;br/&gt;fundamental theorem of Liouville provided the bridge between&lt;br/&gt;the classical theory and modern measurable dynamics. The study&lt;br/&gt;of the connections between the different and seemingly&lt;br/&gt;unrelated properties of the measurable systems, as well as&lt;br/&gt;relations between the measurable and continuous structures in&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, strengthens our sense of connectedness of the entire&lt;br/&gt;building of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
