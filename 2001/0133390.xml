    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to advance theory and practice in the design, modeling and control of high performance communication networks. The scope of the project encompasses system-level issues in high-speed wireline networks, and interconnecting of wireline/wireless networks. The research component of the project will be directed in three focus areas: (1) switch architectures and control algorithms for high speed networks; (2) mobility, connectivity and control of wireless networks; and (3) network modeling and simulation methodologies. Our proposed program of research in these areas is expected to make significant contributions to the design, modeling and control of large-scale, high-speed, heterogeneous communication networks. Research and education will be integrated through the following activities: (1) supervision of graduate and undergraduate research projects; (2) co-authoring of a graduate level two-volume textbook on modeling and analysis of high performance networks; (3) teaching of undergraduate and graduate level courses in the area of communication networks; and (4) development and maintenance of an up-to-date data networking laboratory that will provide students with hands-on experience in the operation and configuration of modern networks.</AbstractNarration>
