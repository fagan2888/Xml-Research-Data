    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER project addresses complementary scanned probe microscopy (SPM) techniques for covalently nanopatterning polymer and biological molecules on silicon surfaces with an integrated research and education plan. One approach explores feedback controlled lithography as a means for templating hydrogen passivated silicon surfaces for subsequent wet chemistry in ambient conditions, and a second approach, termed liquid phase nanolithography (LPN), attempts to pattern organic molecules onto silicon surfaces directly from solution using conductive AFM. In addition to nanolithography, this project explores innovative frequency dependent nanoelectronic and nanophotonic characterization schemes. Nanoscale impedance spectroscopy (NIS) will be developed to delineate the phase and amplitude response of current through a conductive AFM tip in response to a variable frequency applied bias. NIS would provide, in effect, a nanoscale spatial map of the frequency dependent electronic behavior of hybrid hard and soft materials. In the case of photoactive materials, photocurrent will be detected through the conductive AFM tip under sample illumination; whereas, photons emitted from electroluminescent materials will be measured with a photodiode and current preamplifier. The basic elements of these research ideas will be incorporated into a comprehensive interdisciplinary nanoscale education and outreach program. In an effort to induce interdisciplinary interactions among graduate and undergraduate students, the research includes domestic and international collaborations with faculty and industrial representatives from other academic departments. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical area of materials science having technological relevance. Outreach to undergraduates and underrepresented minorities will be addressed through a Research Experience for Undergraduates and Minority Internships in Nanotechnology program that the PI is co-organizing through the Northwestern University Nanoscale Science and Engineering Center. Additionally, the PI is involved in developing new web- based nanomaterials coursework. This undergraduate coursework will then be adapted for the development of a nanomaterials world module for K-12 students, non-science majors, and the general public both domestically and abroad. The scope of the project will expose students to new challenges and research approaches in materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, and the integration of research and education. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
