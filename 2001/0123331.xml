    <AbstractNarration>The Department of Science and Engineering Support (DSES) of the National Technical Institution for the Deaf (NTID) has provided access and educational serves to hearing disabled/impaired students at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) for more than thirty years. Each year the program serves100 students who receive degrees in science, mathematics, and engineering, and 10-15 underprepared high-school students in a pre-baccalaureate program, as well as 150-200 students who are matriculating in other majors and taking science/mathematics as part of their curricular requirements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NTID DSES provides mentoring through advising/counseling, tutoring, instruction, note-taking and interpretive services, and as a liaison with host colleges as advocates for students. Those activities are deemed as critical for this population of students who are otherwise ignored or invisible in mainstream education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also, it is especially beneficial to the greater population of students who are not hearing impaired, to be mentored in relating to the hearing impaired. This is a positive effect for global society. Programs and networks within the NTID are well planned, carefully documented, and provide a trusted base for participants.</AbstractNarration>
