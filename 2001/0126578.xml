    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;This project is developing a multidisciplinary B.S. Program in Biotechnology that places a heavy emphasis on both methodology and ethical, socio-political and economic outcomes to provide students with the necessary skills required for (1) entry-level laboratory positions in the pharmaceutical industries and academia, and (2) placement into research-based graduate programs. We are adapting materials from institutions offering a B.S. in Biotechnology including: Cedar Crest College, Clarion University of Pennsylvania, Eastern Washington University, Elizabethtown College, Ferris State University, Moorhead State University, University of Southern Maine, University of Wisconsin and Worcester State College. A newly-approved B.S. in Biotechnology is providing cutting-edge technology training for biotechnology students within a framework of a core curriculum, community service, internships in biotechnology laboratories, and small faculty/student ratios. Cabrini College is constructing a state-of-the-art building to house a new Center for Science, Education and Technology. The Biotechnology Program is to be housed in the new Center.&lt;br/&gt;In its first stage, this program is being offered to traditional undergraduate students, and concentrates on outreach, recruitment and admissions . As it matures, additional students will be drawn from non-traditional students and transfer students. Area high school teachers participating in a Cabrini-taught summer course," DNA and the New Millennium", will be part of the feeder school process for locating new students for the program.</AbstractNarration>
