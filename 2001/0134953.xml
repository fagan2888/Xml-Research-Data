    <AbstractNarration>This CAREER award to Professor Neil Kelleher of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division. The overall research goal is to analyze entire proteins by mass spectrometry as efficiently as small peptides are processed today. The main research goal involves development of a unique measurement platform centering around Fourier-Transform Mass Spectrometry (FTMS) and automating the fractionation and fragmentation of wild-type proteins above 10 kDa. Realization of this goal will detect biological events in the extremophilic organism, Methanoccoccus janaschii, that unexpectedly generate a protein of different molecular weight than that predicted from the sequenced and annotated genome. This career plan also reflects a determination to positively influence large numbers of young students. Specific plans include direct visitation to six high schools in Illinois with follow up field trips to the University for students to peek at research, and a teaching conference for regional educators of 14-18 year old students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our society's expectations for postgenomic biomedicine and bioengineering demands a better understanding of proteins and their structural modifications. The unique analytical platform described above will contribute to the national research infrastructure and analyze genome-predicted proteins with unprecendented detail in the least-studied domain of life. The thermophilic enzymes encountered could be engineered into industrial catalysts with less negative impact on the environment. Execution of this plan will also recruit, train and educate people at many levels for an improved understanding of modern biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>
