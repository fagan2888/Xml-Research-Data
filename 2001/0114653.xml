    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a novel optical technique, termed&lt;br/&gt; Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET), as a resource for the plant&lt;br/&gt; functional genomics community, specifically in the model species Arabidopsis&lt;br/&gt; thaliana. BRET has shown promise as a tool to chart the physical contacts&lt;br/&gt; between specific cellular proteins, and their time-resolved interactions, in&lt;br/&gt; living tissue and in real time. While the importance of such interactions has&lt;br/&gt; long been recognized in the life sciences, the corresponding experimental tools&lt;br/&gt; have largely been limited to in vitro conditions or to heterologous, non-plant&lt;br/&gt; organisms. Therefore, the BRET technique will provide a unique contribution&lt;br/&gt; toward delineating the functions of the 25,000 genes thought to be contained&lt;br/&gt; within the Arabidopsis genome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; BRET is a form of radiation-free energy&lt;br/&gt; transfer that can occur when two compatible optical probes are brought into&lt;br/&gt; molecular proximity. In detail, to probe for a protein-protein interaction&lt;br/&gt; between two given partner proteins, the two proteins are genetically fused to a&lt;br/&gt; blue light emitting luciferase and to a blue light absorbing yellow fluorescent&lt;br/&gt; protein. If the two hybrid proteins interact, the excitation energy of the&lt;br/&gt; luciferase may be transferred to the fluorescent protein, resulting in an&lt;br/&gt; easily detected yellow-shift in the luminescence spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The first goal&lt;br/&gt; of this project is to construct molecular genetic tools, such as cloning&lt;br/&gt; vectors, for the expression of BRET hybrid proteins. Second, instrumentation&lt;br/&gt; and experimental protocols will be optimized for time-resolved BRET data&lt;br/&gt; acquisition. Moreover, as a prototype example of the efficacy of BRET for&lt;br/&gt; research in plants, BRET will be applied to illuminate the genetic networks&lt;br/&gt; that mediate the control of nuclear gene expression by light and the circadian&lt;br/&gt; clock. Resources developed in this project shall be widely disseminated to&lt;br/&gt; encourage their application within the entire plant science community&lt;br/&gt; (http://chicory.bio.vanderbilt.edu/chj/arabidopsisbret</AbstractNarration>
