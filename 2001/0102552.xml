    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0102552&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator studies complete &lt;br/&gt;aspherical spaces with particular emphasis on the &lt;br/&gt;rigidity of local splitting structures &lt;br/&gt;and the minimal volume problem. Dr. Cao &lt;br/&gt;intends to continue his work on Gromov's &lt;br/&gt;minimal volume gap conjecture jointly with &lt;br/&gt;his coauthors. Using the F-structure theory developed &lt;br/&gt;by Cheeger and Gromov and the heat flow, he &lt;br/&gt;would like to study the minimal volume gap &lt;br/&gt;conjecture for complete aspherical &lt;br/&gt;manifolds. The investigator hopes to &lt;br/&gt;show that if a compact nonpositively curved &lt;br/&gt;manifold $M$ is homotopy equivalent to a generalized &lt;br/&gt;graph-manifold, then $M$ must be a generalized &lt;br/&gt;graph-manifold with vanishing minimal volume as well. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, Cao plans to continue &lt;br/&gt;his study of the sign of the Euler number of &lt;br/&gt;compact aspherical manifolds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the study of global &lt;br/&gt;geometric shape of aspherical spaces. The examples &lt;br/&gt;of aspherical spaces include flat tires and surfaces &lt;br/&gt;with more than two holes, such as pretzels. There are &lt;br/&gt;also examples of higher dimensional aspherical &lt;br/&gt;spaces. Our universe can be viewed a 3-dimensional &lt;br/&gt;aspherical space. Dr. Cao is trying to investigate &lt;br/&gt;diameter, volume, spectrum and other geometric data &lt;br/&gt;of those spaces. Cao has also been interested in the &lt;br/&gt;study of the shortest closed curves on non-positively &lt;br/&gt;curved spaces. He has already shown that two such surfaces &lt;br/&gt;with possible cusps are isometric if and &lt;br/&gt;only if the data of lengths of all shortest closed curves on &lt;br/&gt;the two surfaces are identical. The data of lengths &lt;br/&gt;of all shortest closed curves on a closed &lt;br/&gt;surface M is called the marked length spectrum &lt;br/&gt;of the space M. The study of marked length spectrum on &lt;br/&gt;spaces with boundaries has a number of applications &lt;br/&gt;in modern industry and geological sciences.</AbstractNarration>
