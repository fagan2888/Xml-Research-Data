    <AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to explore ways of integrating forefront research into undergraduate education. The PI is creating a collaborative environment in which research faculty scholars at universities translate their cutting-edge scientific research into meaningful undergraduate educational experiences. Participating faculty have a) free access to the PI's open source core software tools, which ease the development of new software, b) a full set of assessment-based curriculum development frameworks based on the PI's prior education efforts, c) access to the education and research staff of the PI and collaborating institutions, and d) web-based community support. The PI is also developing collaborations with teaching faculty scholars from 2- and 4-year colleges and community colleges to facilitate the introduction of research-based educational materials into their science courses and encourage science research opportunities for undergraduates. Participating faculty have a) free access to all educational technologies developed through prior and concurrent development collaborations, b) free access to assessment-based curriculum activities, c) an ongoing collaboration with a research university and the research staff of the PI and collaborators, and d) Web-based community support.</AbstractNarration>
