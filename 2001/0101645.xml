    <AbstractNarration>Midlands Technical College is adapting and implementing the telecommunications education program developed at Springfield Technical Community College's Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technologies (NCTT). The Departments of Engineering Technologies and Engineering Transfer are adapting the NCTT curriculum to include a pre-telecommunications technologies component to be delivered by secondary teachers to high schools in Richland, Lexington and Fairfield counties. Laboratories are being designed to house the appropriate equipment, and Midlands is ensuring the ongoing operation and continued support for the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to articulated coursework in telecommunications in local high schools, the project is facilitating the professional growth and development of college and high school instructors as well as recruiting, retaining, graduating, and placing students in good jobs. Partners include Springfield Technical Community College, the Northeast Center for Telecommunications Technologies, the three schools districts, CISCO, the Central Carolina Economic Development Alliance, the SC State Technical College System, and the Central Midlands School-to-Work Consortium.</AbstractNarration>
