    <AbstractNarration>The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory's (SREL) research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program provides scientific training and hands-on experience in the process of research by actively involving undergraduates in projects with full time research ecologists. Project participants will examine the influence of nuclear and fossil fuel energy production and associated technologies on selected biological and chemical properties in southeastern ecosystems. SREL is located on the US Departments of Energy's 720 km2 Savannah River Site (SRS), where a variety of habitats including pine forests, abandoned farmlands and freshwater wetlands adjoin industrial facilities and anthropogenetically-disturbed areas. Participant selection is based on written statements of interests and goals in the application, letters of recommendation, and academic record. We seek diversity and actively recruit minority applicants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this program is to provide the next generation of ecologists and environmental scientists with an introduction to the practice of scientific research. Students accepted into the program perform independent research projects that interface with ongoing research programs at SREL. Faculty members actively engaged in research and publication are paired with students with compatible research interests. At the beginning of their residence, students participate in a series of workshops led by SREL faculty and staff on research design, ethics, data collection and processing, and oral and written presentation of results. They also prepare a formal research proposal in collaboration with their faculty advisor. Students receive hands-on training while performing their projects, as well as through brown bag seminar-discussion groups, formal seminars, group field trips to representative biomes of the southeast, and collegial interactions among themselves and permanent research staff and faculty. Near the conclusion of their residence, there is a formal workshop on graduate study. Each student must present a brief seminar on their project before their peers and SREL faculty and staff. They also prepare a scientific manuscript based on their research, and participate in an exit interview and survey to provide feedback for program improvement. These activities continue and refine undergraduate research training at SREL, which began over 30 years ago, and has involved over 600 undergraduate participants to date. This type of hands-on training and experience has proved highly beneficial in attracting quality students to careers in environmental science, and preparing them for graduate study and future research endeavors.</AbstractNarration>
