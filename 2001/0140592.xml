    <AbstractNarration>PI: Barry Simon, California Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;DMS-0140592&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Simon will continue his research focusing on direct and inverse&lt;br/&gt;spectral problems for Schrodinger operators and their discrete analogs. He&lt;br/&gt;plans to explore the impact of sum rules for spectral theory both for Jacobi&lt;br/&gt;matrices (where he and Killip recently solved several long open conjectures&lt;br/&gt;from the Orthogonal Polynomial community using sum rules) and Schrodinger&lt;br/&gt;operators. Other problems he expects to look at include the structure of&lt;br/&gt;the isospectral manifold for problems with discrete spectrum, resonance&lt;br/&gt;counting in higher dimensions, and the study of mixed singular continuous&lt;br/&gt;and point spectrum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental problem in wide swaths of science is determining the relation&lt;br/&gt;between some object that can only be observed indirectly and the information&lt;br/&gt;you can observe indirectly. There are two sides of issue: determine what&lt;br/&gt;is indirectly observed for a given state of the system, called the direct&lt;br/&gt;problem, and trying to induce properties of the system from the indirect&lt;br/&gt;observations, called the inverse problem. Professor Simon will study&lt;br/&gt;various aspects of direct and inverse problems in quantum mechanics. While&lt;br/&gt;the focus will be on the equations of quantum theory, there are potential&lt;br/&gt;spinoffs to tomography and radar/sonar direct and inverse problems.</AbstractNarration>
