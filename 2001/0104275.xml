    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0104275&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Tim Cochran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops a new area of noncommutative algebraic&lt;br/&gt;topology and its applications to low-dimensional topology. The&lt;br/&gt;success of algebraic topology in knot theory, for example, has,&lt;br/&gt;until recently centered around abelian invariants, that is to&lt;br/&gt;say, invariants associated to the universal abelian covering&lt;br/&gt;space of the knot or link exterior. These invariants are the&lt;br/&gt;Alexander module, which is the first homology of this cover as a&lt;br/&gt;module over a commutative Laurent polynomial ring, and the&lt;br/&gt;Blanchfield pairing. These determine the S-equivalence class of&lt;br/&gt;the knot as well as various other invariants. From the&lt;br/&gt;perspective of the knot group G, the Alexander module is simply&lt;br/&gt;G'/G". Hence any behavior associated to G" will be invisible to&lt;br/&gt;these abelian invariants. We remedy this deficiency by studying&lt;br/&gt;the quotients of successive terms of the higher derived series,&lt;br/&gt;or, put another way, study modules associated to more general&lt;br/&gt;solvable covering spaces. These are modules over noncommutative&lt;br/&gt;rings and thus are difficult to work with. We use techniques from&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative algebra and C* algebras to define invariants. We&lt;br/&gt;find , for each integer n, an entire theory which parallels the&lt;br/&gt;Alexander module and Blanchfield form and signatures. There are&lt;br/&gt;applications to estimating genus, detecting fibered knots and&lt;br/&gt;3-manifolds, new invariants of concordance and representations of&lt;br/&gt;mapping class groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advent of quantum mechanics led scientists to many&lt;br/&gt;paradoxical, but now accepted, facts about our universe. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, there came the realization that "commutative&lt;br/&gt;mathematics" was inadequate to describe our physical&lt;br/&gt;world. Recall that 2 times 3 equals 3 times 2 is the commutative&lt;br/&gt;law of multiplication of numbers. Quantum mechanics showed that&lt;br/&gt;physical quantities are not mere numbers but more like arrays or&lt;br/&gt;matrices of numbers. Since multiplication of matrices is not&lt;br/&gt;commutative, this explains and models noncommutative phenomena at&lt;br/&gt;the most fundamental levels of the physical world. This project&lt;br/&gt;studies the shape of 3 and 4-dimensional spaces by using new&lt;br/&gt;noncommutative mathematics arising from algebra.</AbstractNarration>
