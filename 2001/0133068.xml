    <AbstractNarration>The Advanced Materials Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this Career award to Washington University. With this award, Professor Thomas Vaid will systematically study controlled doping of organic hydrocarbons using isostructural n- and p-dopants. Dopants will be synthesized and characterized for electrical charge transport behavior in solid state and electrochemical properties in solution. Doped crystals will be grown by a number of methods including vapor sublimation, melt crystallization and solution-phase crystallization. Junctions will be formed between doped semiconductors by vapor deposition or alloy junction growth to study current rectification behavior and photovoltaic responses. Organic light emitting diodes and organic field effect transistors are potential devices to be expected from these doped organic semiconducting crystals. The proposed educational program includes introduction of materials chemistry courses and laboratory experiments with special emphasis on acquisition and analysis of physical data on molecules and materials synthesized by students. Research training provided by the program will prepare graduate and undergraduate students for advanced studies and research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;New organic semiconducting crystal will be synthesized from hydrocarbons using isostructural doping using newly synthesized n- and p-dopants. Educational programs in materials chemistry will prepare students for advanced studies and research in electrooptic and conjugated materials.</AbstractNarration>
