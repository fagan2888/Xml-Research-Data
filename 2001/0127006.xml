    <AbstractNarration>Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;Using the recommendations from a workshop supported jointly by NSF, AGU, and the Keck Consortium (NSF, 1996), Western Oregon University recently implemented a broad-based, integrated Earth systems science approach to undergraduate geoscience education that is a unique program in the state of Oregon. One of the key objectives of this state-of-the-art curriculum shift is to engage undergraduate Earth Science majors in the process of "doing science" (NSF, 1996). The primary objective of this course improvement project is to adapt and implement an active, inquiry-based approach to teaching mineralogy and petrology within the context of this new Earth systems science curriculum. This pedagogical model integrates geologic problem solving with petrographic microscopy and digital image analysis in an introductory petrology course that serves as the foundation for the study of Earth materials in the Earth Science major. Using thin sections as a geologic database, Earth Science majors become proficient in making observations, identifying scientific problems, proposing working hypotheses that can be tested using computer-based technologies, and defending their results in class-wide discussions via multi-media presentation systems and written reports. To implement this innovative pedagogical model, a petrographic microscope and digital camera are interfaced with a computer, digital image analysis software, and a set of student petrographic microscopes. In addition to the petrology course, this instrumentation is being widely utilized throughout the broad-based, undergraduate Earth systems science curriculum and is being used for outreach activities that are designed to showcase the exciting world of microscopy and digital image analysis to K-12 students and science educators.</AbstractNarration>
