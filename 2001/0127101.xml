    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13) In order to better attract and retain students, the physics department is beginning a new research and teaching emphasis in optics. About half of a new 4-credit-hour research preparation course is devoted to optics. For the research preparation course, the project is adapting and implementing optics experiments that were developed at Boston University and New Jersey Institute of&lt;br/&gt;Technology with funding from NSF. Experiments are chosen to both to prepare students to carry out independent research projects in holographic interferometry and to give them exposure to the rapidly developing field of fiber optics. The project is supporting laser beam characterizing equipment, modal analysis, a fiber optics kit, optical table, and hardware. The project is adapting the experiments to the smaller institutional size and to focus on holography. In the first implementation of the course, students choose one of these experiments as a special project. Using the existing materials and the new equipment, they set it up and demonstrate it to their classmates. Their work is then the basis for use by future students.</AbstractNarration>
