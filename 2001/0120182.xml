    <AbstractNarration>This is funding to subsidize travel and housing expenses of students selected to participate in the Student Research Workshop to be held in conjunction with the 2nd Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL-2001), which will take place June 3-7, 2001 in Pittsburgh. The intimate workshop format will encourage student participants to begin building a rapport with established researchers. Students will have sufficient time to present their research (25 minutes) and then receive feedback from a panel of established researchers in the field (15 minutes). The workshop will provide students with invaluable exposure to outside perspectives on their work at a critical time in their research, and will also allow them to put their work into perspective based on feedback from the panel and from fellow participants.</AbstractNarration>
