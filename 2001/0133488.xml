    <AbstractNarration>Internet data traffic is doubling each year. If this rate continues,&lt;br/&gt;data traffic will surpass voice traffic around the year 2002. However,&lt;br/&gt;not included in the Internet traffic growth rate estimates are the&lt;br/&gt;potential data generated by web phones and mobile web-enabled PDAs,&lt;br/&gt;nor are the effects of future, unforeseen ``killer apps'' that may&lt;br/&gt;great increase the current demand for bandwidth. Thus, the data growth&lt;br/&gt;rate could be significantly higher in the aggregate and at the very&lt;br/&gt;least, some ``hot sites'' may experience a quadrupling of traffic each&lt;br/&gt;year. Unfortunately, due to technological barriers, bandwidth growth&lt;br/&gt;rates per fiber will be limited to only doubling per&lt;br/&gt;year. Consequently, short falls in available bandwidth may result,&lt;br/&gt;thus placing the burden to effectively manage bandwidth on overworked,&lt;br/&gt;network management teams. Network managers will require techniques and&lt;br/&gt;tools that enable them to "nowcast" not only their local network, but&lt;br/&gt;surrounding networks as well in order to ensure, stable, effective&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth allocation in the face of dynamic, high-bandwidth, next&lt;br/&gt;generation ``killer web apps''.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address this "nowcasting" problem, we propose the use of a new&lt;br/&gt;parallel simulation modeling technique called "reverse&lt;br/&gt;computation". Here, network models designed for parallel execution are&lt;br/&gt;able to execute both forwards and backwards in simulated time. For&lt;br/&gt;simplistic network models, reverse computation has been shown to&lt;br/&gt;reduce the state memory requirements of parallel optimistic&lt;br/&gt;simulations by a factor of 100 and increase the overall speedup by a&lt;br/&gt;factor of 6 when compared to classic state-saving techniques used to&lt;br/&gt;support rollback processing in optimistic simulations. We also believe&lt;br/&gt;reverse computation will allow large-scale network models to scale to&lt;br/&gt;much larger processor configurations as well as enable a more&lt;br/&gt;efficient design of simulation experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to understand the fundamental&lt;br/&gt;functional and performance limits of reverse computation when applied&lt;br/&gt;to the modeling of large-scale systems. Because of its importance and&lt;br/&gt;impact, we have selected network models as our driving application.&lt;br/&gt;To achieve this goal, we propose to investigate reverse computation in&lt;br/&gt;the following five major research thrust areas:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. the design and implementation of perfectly reversible computation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for event-list management, and time management to enable&lt;br/&gt;scalable, efficient optimistic event processing,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. the development of processes and techniques to effectively model a&lt;br/&gt;large-scale, multi-protocol network scenario in a parallel simulation,&lt;br/&gt;reverse computation framework,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. the comparison and contrast of reverse computation performance to&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art conservative synchronization techniques,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. the creation of new methods and techniques for the design of&lt;br/&gt;simulation experiments that take advantage of reverse computation,&lt;br/&gt;and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. the exploration of the linkages between reverse computation,&lt;br/&gt;quantum computing and classic parallel/distributed computing that&lt;br/&gt;could lead to a more unified view of these disparate classes of&lt;br/&gt;computation.</AbstractNarration>
