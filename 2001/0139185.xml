    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to the University of North Dakota for the support of a three-year REU Site entitled, "Engaging Undergraduates in Multidisciplinary Remote Sensing Image Acquisition and Analysis Research at the University of North Dakota," under the direction of Dr. Richard R. Schultz. This 10-week summer program will provide eight undergraduate students and two math/science middle/high schoolteachers with the opportunity to conduct research on three remote sensing projects with the assistance of faculty mentors. The students will participate in research group meetings, professional development seminars, and a mini-conference at the end of the summer where they will be required to individually prepare and deliver an oral presentation to Senior Personnel and all other interested parties. Each participant will be required to submit a research paper to her/his project mentors, which may be submitted by the mentors to an undergraduate research conference or an international research conference.</AbstractNarration>
