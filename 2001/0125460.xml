    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By integrating computer ethics across the curriculum, this project addresses the following &lt;br/&gt;concerns: 1) the increased use of instructional technology in the classroom; 2) the growth &lt;br/&gt;of enrollment in online distance education programs; 3) the need to improve the knowledge &lt;br/&gt;of ethical, social and legal issues in computing of women and underrepresented minorities; &lt;br/&gt;and 4) the limited ties between technology and other disciplines. The workplan is to: &lt;br/&gt;1) develop modules that are interdisciplinary in design and that capitalize on the life &lt;br/&gt;experiences of Mercy students for all the general education courses offered at the College; &lt;br/&gt;2) develop modules addressing the specific issues of online distance learning courses; &lt;br/&gt;3) lead workshops on designing ethics modules for all courses for the Mercy faculty on a &lt;br/&gt;faculty seminar day; 4) design and conducting an online workshop for faculty at other &lt;br/&gt;colleges and universities; and 5) develop a new course for computer information science &lt;br/&gt;majors. These curriculum enhancements are designed to: 1) increase the diversity of &lt;br/&gt;students who are knowledgeable about computer ethics and the related social and legal&lt;br/&gt;issues so the rewards of technology can be reaped by all in an equitable manner, and &lt;br/&gt;2) emphasize oral, written and critical thinking competencies while focusing on the &lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary connections of computer ethics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to accomplish this work, we are adapting a range of materials previously developed and made available to the community via NSF support. These materials include a range of case studies in computer ethics and the social aspects of computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This course includes an online team-taught module with a faculty member of DePaul &lt;br/&gt;University and student-student collaborative projects from the two institutions.</AbstractNarration>
