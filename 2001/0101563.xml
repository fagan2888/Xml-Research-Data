    <AbstractNarration>Kopriva, David&lt;br/&gt;From: R. Bruce Kellogg [kellogg@ipst.umd.edu]&lt;br/&gt;Sent: Thursday, May 31, 2001 6:04 AM&lt;br/&gt;To: dkopriva@nsf.gov&lt;br/&gt;Cc: kellogg@ipst.umd.edu&lt;br/&gt;Subject: Proposal No: 0101563 - Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: 0101563 - Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some problems of mathematical and numerical analysis related to&lt;br/&gt;singularly perturbed boundary value problems will be studied. The&lt;br/&gt;mathematical problems include obtaining sharp bounds for derivatives of&lt;br/&gt;the solution that take into account boundary layers, interior layers, and&lt;br/&gt;corner singularities. The numerical problems include the development of&lt;br/&gt;stabilized discretizations for these singularly perturbed problems and&lt;br/&gt;the study of the best approximation properties of singular perturbation&lt;br/&gt;problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work studies physical systems in which some quantities&lt;br/&gt;undergo rapid changes in certain regions. Such systems include fluid flow,&lt;br/&gt;where the rapid changes occur at boundary layers, shocks, and interior&lt;br/&gt;layers. These systems arise in the design of fluid machinery, the study&lt;br/&gt;of underground oil and water transport, the modeling of airflow over&lt;br/&gt;cars and airplanes, and other areas. The results of this research will&lt;br/&gt;be of use in the development of more accurate computer simulations of&lt;br/&gt;these systems, with consequent improvements in the design of equipment&lt;br/&gt;used in such real-world problems. In addition, the proposal provides&lt;br/&gt;for regular visits of Professor M. Stynes to the U.S.; it is planned&lt;br/&gt;that Prof. Stynes will interact with graduate students in mathematics who&lt;br/&gt;are working in related areas.</AbstractNarration>
