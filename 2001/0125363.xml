    <AbstractNarration>When professional mathematicians and scientists discuss the nature and&lt;br/&gt;origins of their own creativity, they often mention the central role&lt;br/&gt;played by visual and spatial thinking. But despite the apparent importance&lt;br/&gt;of visual/spatial cognition in mathematics and science education, there is&lt;br/&gt;still relatively little research aimed at understanding, enhancing, and&lt;br/&gt;assessing spatial reasoning in math and science students. Even more, there&lt;br/&gt;are few efforts that seek to blend novel computational media with the&lt;br/&gt;sorts of spatially and mathematically rich hands-on crafting activities&lt;br/&gt;that influenced and motivated earlier generations of scientists. We&lt;br/&gt;believe that progress can be made on both these fronts--on both basic&lt;br/&gt;cognitive research and pedagogical development--by an effort at&lt;br/&gt;integration. That is: by designing playful, creative, and technologically&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated educational materials for exercising and enhancing spatial&lt;br/&gt;cognition, we can use those materials as the means to explore and&lt;br/&gt;understand fundamental issues in spatial cognition as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of this project, then, we plan to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Characterize the nature of spatial expertise in the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional forms, while creating flexible assessment techniques to&lt;br/&gt;measure development of that expertise;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Devise a practical spatial curriculum of materials designed to enhance&lt;br/&gt;and exercise spatial cognition. This curriculum will be based on a&lt;br/&gt;combination of both hands-on work and creative computational papercrafting&lt;br/&gt;activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Extend our current software research environments (HyperGami and&lt;br/&gt;JavaGami) to incorporate online spatial advisors that assist students in&lt;br/&gt;reflecting upon, understanding, playing with, and interpreting&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional polyhedral forms; and&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Create new software to explore both traditional and novel realms of&lt;br/&gt;mathematical papercrafting, such as pop-ups, flexagons, anamorphic art,&lt;br/&gt;and surface models. In exploring these areas, we seek to expand the&lt;br/&gt;landscape of traditional mathematical papercrafts by exploiting the&lt;br/&gt;creative potential of computational media.</AbstractNarration>
