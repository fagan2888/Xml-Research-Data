    <AbstractNarration>Professor Jonathan L. Sessler in the Department of Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry at the University of Texas at Austin is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on novel polypyrrolic macrocycles that differ from naturally occurring tetrapyrrolic systems by virtue of being "pyrrole-inverted" or topographically non-planar. The preparation of these new materials and the study of their basic chemical properties, including those associated with anion complexation, cation coordination, and ability to stabilize unusual oxidation states, will be undertaken.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jonathan Sessler is studying the interactions between ions and polycyclic organic compounds which function as receptors for them. Potential analytical and medical applications for these polypyrrolic materials are anion sensing and purification, radioactive waste remediation, or as fluorescent markers for the diagnosis of neoplastic or cardiovascular disease.</AbstractNarration>
