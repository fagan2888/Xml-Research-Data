    <AbstractNarration>The focus of this proposal is the design and implementation of&lt;br/&gt;cluster-based electronic commerce servers (or simply distributed&lt;br/&gt;e-commerce servers) that are efficient, scalable, and capable of&lt;br/&gt;service differentiation. To achieve these properties, our servers&lt;br/&gt;will efficiently adapt their quality of service, will efficiently&lt;br/&gt;handle any type of incoming request according to the client's profile,&lt;br/&gt;will not involve any centralized resources, and will cache both static&lt;br/&gt;and certain dynamic content. The key challenges are in determining&lt;br/&gt;the set of policies and mechanisms that should be used to&lt;br/&gt;differentiate the services provided and to implement truly efficient&lt;br/&gt;and scalable policies and mechanisms for request processing. At the&lt;br/&gt;end of the project, we will demonstrate two distributed e-commerce&lt;br/&gt;servers (an on-line store and an auction server) running on a cluster&lt;br/&gt;with 64 processors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contributions of this project will be the following: (1) A&lt;br/&gt;complete and general characterization of e-commerce workloads; (2) An&lt;br/&gt;understanding of the issues involved in service differentiation for&lt;br/&gt;distributed e-commerce servers, including the use of optimizations&lt;br/&gt;based on the past history of actions taken by high-priority clients;&lt;br/&gt;(3) The design, implementation, and evaluation of mechanisms for&lt;br/&gt;shared state maintenance and transaction support in distributed&lt;br/&gt;e-commerce servers; and (4) The study of techniques and mechanisms for&lt;br/&gt;improving the efficiency and scalability of distributed e-commerce&lt;br/&gt;servers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We believe that the potential implications of our research and&lt;br/&gt;contributions are far reaching. In fact, we think that the impact of&lt;br/&gt;our research can be substantial, given how significantly various&lt;br/&gt;companies have come to rely on their on-line networking operations.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, our research can be useful for operating systems and&lt;br/&gt;distributed systems teaching purposes, as our software infrastructure&lt;br/&gt;will provide a tool for the study of distributed e-commerce servers.</AbstractNarration>
