    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0104196 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three principle investigators on this proposal will be&lt;br/&gt;involved in research in the following areas: Barry Mazur will be involved&lt;br/&gt;in at least four major projects. The first concerns Euler systems and&lt;br/&gt;their applications in algebraic geometry, arithmetic and analytic number&lt;br/&gt;theory. The second project will study interpolations of modular&lt;br/&gt;eigenforms via special curves. The third concerns the ABC conjecture in&lt;br/&gt;number theory and the fourth concerns rational points on rationally&lt;br/&gt;connected varieties. Raoul Bott will conduct research at the interface&lt;br/&gt;between mathematics and physics including research topics that relate to&lt;br/&gt;computational complexity, equivariant cohomology, diffeomorphism groups&lt;br/&gt;and toric varieties. The major project of Clifford Taubes concerns the&lt;br/&gt;coding of smooth 4-manifold structures by the pseudo-holomorphic curves&lt;br/&gt;defined by their self-dual 2-forms. The first long range goal is to read&lt;br/&gt;off invariants of smooth 4-manifolds from these curves. The second goal&lt;br/&gt;is to use them to simplify a presentation of the manifold.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here are some comments of a less technical nature about this&lt;br/&gt;research: Barry Mazurs work concerns properties of the integers and&lt;br/&gt;relations between them. A typical question asks for integers, say a, b&lt;br/&gt;and c, that satisfy some given equation. An example is the equation of&lt;br/&gt;Pythagoreas, which asks that the sum of the squares of a and b equal that&lt;br/&gt;of c. There are very general and natural classes of such relations (such&lt;br/&gt;as those involved in the now proved Fermat conjecture) that probe to the&lt;br/&gt;heart of the theory of numbers; and the study of such equations forms the&lt;br/&gt;core of Mazurs research. Raoul Botts work probes the manner in which&lt;br/&gt;families of symmetries can be used to simplify computations in mathematics&lt;br/&gt;and theoretical physics. These symmetries relate different structures and&lt;br/&gt;often this relation equates a simple to understand property of one system&lt;br/&gt;to a mysterious and not understood property of another. Clifford Taubes&lt;br/&gt;major project probes the possibilities for the large scale structure of&lt;br/&gt;four dimensional universes. Our universe has four dimensions, these the&lt;br/&gt;usual three dimensions of space plus time as the fourth. This said, the&lt;br/&gt;research seeks to provide a complete list of the possible large scale&lt;br/&gt;structures for a universe such as ours. To put this in perspective, there&lt;br/&gt;is a conjectured list for all possible three dimensional spaces, but there&lt;br/&gt;is as yet no credible conjecture for a similar list for four dimensions.</AbstractNarration>
