    <AbstractNarration>With this award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program in the Division of Materials Research, scientists at the University of Maryland will develop a microwave microscope based on the phenomenon of ferromagnetic resonance. Using a novel hemispherical cavity design, which focuses the microwave field, they will attain the spatial resolution of 5 micron or better with an ultimate goal of less than 1 micron. The instrument will allow mapping out many different magnetic properties including magnetization, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic anisotropy. It will also measure magnetic homogeneity and image local stresses via magnetoelastic coupling. In addition, by using multiple cavity resonance, which range from 5 to 50 GHz, we will also be able to investigate local spin relaxation dynamics. The instrument will play a key role in the education and training of the next generation of students studying magnetic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program in the Division of Materials Research is for instrument development at the University of Maryland. Scientists at the university of Maryland will develop an innovative scanning probe microscope, which allows mapping of a variety of magnetic properties of materials. Magnetism plays a critical role in many technological applications including magnetic storage and magneto-optic switches for high-speed communications. The microscope will be invaluable for investigating properties that are difficult to study by conventional magnetic techniques. This will also be used to screen combinatorial libraries to aid in the search for novel magnetic materials. This new type of scanning probe microscope will become a useful educational tool by providing spatially resolved images of various properties.</AbstractNarration>
