    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding to create a mathematical framework to design effective aviation security system strategies. Aviation security protects vital national interests, as well as passengers and aircraft. Key components of an aviation security system include baggage and passenger screening devices and operations. The goals of this project are to determine: (1) how to measure the performance of aviation security systems, (2) where to deploy aviation security technology devices when designing such systems, (3) how to operate such devices optimally after they are deployed, and (4) how to quantify and optimize the resulting effectiveness of deployment and security operation strategies. The methodology will use discrete optimization models such as the knapsack problem, complexity analysis, and heuristics developed for intractable instances of the models to conduct the necessary analysis and to obtain the desired results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will provide a systematic approach to compare and evaluate different types of aviation security system strategies that incorporate both new and existing aviation security technologies. This approach also has the potential to be used to design and implement new aviation security system strategies capable of enhancing the level of security attainable given the security resources and technologies that are currently available or may be available in the future. Moreover, the results of this research can be used to quantify the value of new investments in different types of aviation security technologies, to determine their potential impact on enhancing aviation security at airports within the nation. Beyond aviation security, this approach may also be applied to other screening environments, such as computer security systems screening for unauthorized users and food safety systems screening for toxic levels of bacteria.&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to create a mathematical framework to design effective aviation security system strategies.
