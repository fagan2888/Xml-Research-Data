    <AbstractNarration>There are now close to 20 documented examples of a role for quantum effects in enzyme catalyzed C-H activation processes. Insights from the ongoing work on H-tunneling in enzymes include the recognition that enzymes modify the entire reaction barrier shape (i.e., reaction barrier width as well as height) and that protein dynamics may play a role in the bond cleavage events catalyzed by enzymes. Further investigations are to be focused on establishing a firmer and more detailed relationship between protein dynamics and H-tunneling. Several hydride transfer reactions will be studied, catalyzed by a high temperature alcohol dehydrogenase (ht-ADH) with homology to the mesophilic horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase and a thermophilic dihydrofolate reductase (ht-DHFR) with significant homology to mesophilic DHFR. In the case of ht-ADH, studies are in progress to solve the three dimensional structure for this enzyme. This structural information will guide site specific mutagenesis experiments to analyze the effect of protein side&lt;br/&gt;chains on catalysis. In particular, the effects at elevated temperatures where tunneling is dominant and at reduced temperatures where H-transfer becomes more classical will be analyzed. Since the ht-ADH is too large for a study of dynamics by NMR, H/D exchange, followed by limited proteolysis and mass spectrometric analysis will be pursued to map out protein flexibility. This laboratory has recently succeeded in cloning and over-expressing a ht-DHFR from B. stearothermophilis. This protein will be analyzed for the contribution of tunneling to H-transfer as a function of temperature. In parallel studies, this small protein (19 KDa) will be studied by NMR (as a probe of local dynamics) and by FT-IR H/D exchange (as a probe of global flexibility).</AbstractNarration>
