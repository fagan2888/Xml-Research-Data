    <AbstractNarration>This project is a three-day conference/workshop at Florida A&amp;M University designed to develop strategies&lt;br/&gt;and mechanisms to bring African American students from HBCUs into graduate programs leading to the PhD in the mathematical sciences. The request is to support the HBCUs involved: Alabama A&amp;M, Jackson State University, and South Carolina State University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference responds to the NSF's Program Solicitation NSF 00-109 and is designed to "contribute to the Foundations effort to enlarge the science personnel of the nation by including students and recent doctoral&lt;br/&gt;recipients, women, minorities..." The goals of the conference are: To facilitate the transfer of mathematics students from the participating HBCUs to the participating majority institutions; to provide integrated student development and counseling oppportunities for the students participating in the program; and to institute linkages with industry and government which will provide intern and employment opportunities for the students involved.</AbstractNarration>
