    <AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the PI to establish a long term research program on the environmental effects (temperature, salinity, prey density) on the population dynamics of jellyfish (including scyphomedusae, hydromedusae, and ctenophores) in the waters of the Puget Sound basin. Jellyfish populations exhibit dramatic interannual fluctuations, and the reasons for this are largely unknown. The PI will conduct laboratory experiments to test the combined effects of temperature, salinity and prey density in combination with in situ sampling with a video system. The initial target species is Aurelia labiata, whose congeners are among the most abundant large jelly fish worldwide. This research is significant because jellyfish populations may be increasing around the world due to the combined effects of human activities. Jellyfish are important consumers of zooplankton, and are generally deleterious to fish populations and commercial fisheries through direct predation on fish eggs and larvae, predator competition, and interference with fish harvesting. It is important to understand the factors that affect their population fluctuations in order to understand the possible effects of changing ocean conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ADVANCE award will promote the career of a female scientist at a critical point. This investment is likely to allow her to re-establish her career a new university, where she will be an excellent role model for students. In addition, the SPML has two strong programs focused on undergraduate research in which the PI will participate as a mentor and instructor. The programs, Minorities in Marine Science Undergraduate Program (MIMSUP) and an Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site program will allow the PI to mentor numerous undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
