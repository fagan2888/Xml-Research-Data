    <AbstractNarration>0118558&lt;br/&gt;Bohs&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is a continuation of the NSF-supported (award 9631587) program at Duke University in which students design and build custom projects for people with disabilities. The objectives of the design projects are to enhance engineering education, provide students with insight into careers in rehabilitation, improve the quality of life of people with disabilities, and serve the community. These projects will address special needs not met by commercial devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program will comprise a course, summer support of student interns, and follow-up service for projects already delivered. During the past five years the course was offered only in the fall semester; however, because of increasing student interest, now it is to be offered in both fall and spring semesters. The expanded program will allow approximately ten projects to be completed each year. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will undertake a real-world design as they develop assistive, recreational, and therapeutic devices for people with disabilities. A health care professional familiar with the client will meet regularly with the student design team to insure that the project meets the client's needs. In addition to this capstone design experience, the course will provide students with exposure to engineering design procedures and ethics, and the overall program will help establish and strengthen ties between the university and the local community.</AbstractNarration>
