    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21)&lt;br/&gt;This project develops software material for teaching mathematical statistics to advanced undergraduate students in science, mathematics, and engineering. The project is a collaborative effort of educators and researchers at the University of California, Berkeley and Davis, the Naval Postgraduate School, and Lucent Technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The software integrates case studies based on real-life problems from diverse fields with multimedia demonstrations of statistical concepts that use visualization, animation, and simulation to create a unique interactive learning environment. The philosophy behind the project is well represented by Moore's statement, "The case for substantive change in statistical instruction is built on strong synergies between content, pedagogy, and technology," (ISR, 1997). The case studies from Stat Labs: Mathematical Statistics through Applications (Nolan &amp; Speed, 2000) provides a model and example content for integrating cases into the software. A distinguishing feature of this interactive environment is the use of professional statistical software, R, as a plug-in to the browser for running demonstrations. Some implications of this feature are that: extensive Java programming of plotting and numerical routines are avoided, the content (cases) and demos can be integrated into one cohesive document, more attention can be paid to the pedagogical aspects of the software. Further the project provides an electronic framework that is easily extensible and adaptable to different contents, therefore making it easier for instructors to incorporate the material into their teaching and to adapt the material to special audiences.</AbstractNarration>
