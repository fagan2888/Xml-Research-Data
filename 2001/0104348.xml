    <AbstractNarration>Prop: AST-0104348&lt;br/&gt;PI: Norman, Dara&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Norman is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at the Cerro Tololo InterAmerican Observatory (CTIO) of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO), in La Serena, Chile. She will use the Deep Lens Survey (DLS) underway at CTIO to continue her studies of the two-point angular correlation function between foreground galaxies and high redshift quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). The DLS will increase ten-fold the number of QSOs used in the most recent large scale, homogeneous survey completed in her earlier work. This increase in sample will enable a more accurate measure of the amplitude and scale of the correlation function which will be used to put limits on cosmological parameters. The DLS will also provide data to search for galaxy distortions or shear in these QSO fields. She will also work with the DLS team to improve the image quality of the MOSAIC II camera on the CTIO 4-meter to ensure that any shear signals, if present, can be detected. Dr. Norman will also initiate and participate in a number of outreach projects at CTIO and NOAO that will bridge educational initiatives in the US and in Chile. She plans on becoming involved in the CTIO Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program, working with a local student group in La Serena to provide astronomy activities, with the goal of linking professional and amateur astronomers with 4th - 9th grade teachers in local communities (Project ASTRO), and working as a resource within the NOAO Research Based Science Education Program. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
