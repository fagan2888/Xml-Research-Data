    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal was received in response to NSF-0019. Research is planned in which phenacenes, which are ribbon-like molecules of fused rings, are examined for their potential to reinforce polymer matrices with unprecedented effectiveness. The research activities incl3de synthesis of the desired phenacenes in monodisperse populations of selected lengths, preparation of microscopic mechanical test specimens, and small-scale mechanical testing to demonstrate the hypothesis that the strength and stiffness of nanocomposites made with phenacenes are significantly higher than those of the corresponding nanocomposites made with carbon nanotubes. The research is a collaboration that combines fundamental chemistry with materials engineering and that targets undergraduate women being trained in the basic physical sciences for the field of post-graduate engineering.</AbstractNarration>
