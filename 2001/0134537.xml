    <AbstractNarration>0134537&lt;br/&gt;Seth &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award supports the US-India Cooperative Research: A New Approach to Boolean Division that can Trade Performance for Computation. US PI Shared Seth, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Somenath Biswas, Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) and two of their graduate students will collaborate on solving an important logic synthesis problem in microelectronic design automation. The investigators will decompose a large circuit into three smaller ones by using Boolean division to compute the two smaller circuits. The objective is to develop a best path technique using approximate algorithms that trade-off performance with time. The researchers will design and implement a single system that enables users to control the trade-off between computational efficiency and quality of output. The results of the proposed research may find extensive use in multilevel Very Large-Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuit synthesis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: This project will enhance US infrastructure through the exchange of senior scientists and graduate students between UNL and IITK, one of India's foremost institutes for computer science. The students will present findings at a well-established VLSI design conference in India; the PIs will publish final documentation in an archival journal. The Office of International Science &amp; Engineering and the Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST) support this activity under the NSF/DST joint program.</AbstractNarration>
