    <AbstractNarration>The research on arrest discretion has rarely recognized the marked influence of officers concerns outside their police identity, such as overtime need, personal commitments, and the aversiveness of arrest-processing itself. Moreover, the literature on police work's impact on the officer's private life has seldom explored the converse effect of off-duty roles interfering with official duties. To address this gap, an anonymous survey of 300 New York Police Department patrol officers will examine such issues as: What personal concerns give rise to arrest-related needs for overtime money, schedule-control, or avoidance of arrest-processing difficult? How are these needs related to various arrest-seeking and arrest-avoiding behaviors? To what extent are on-site arrest decisions predicted by prior arrest preference, patrol style, and method of intervention? When do adaptive responses develop? What arrest-related attitudes accompany adaptive behaviors? How are the responses related to officer tour, gender and other traits? Finally, how are adaptive arrest behaviors influenced by management? The study's objectives are to describe and quantify adaptive arrest behavior, and to explore ways both to minimize the potential harms of self-serving arrest motives and reduce the conflict between officers' personal and professional commitments.</AbstractNarration>
