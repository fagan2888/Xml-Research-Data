    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;This project is a joint effort between two Louisiana Universities, Southern University in Baton Rouge and McNeese State University in Lake Charles. We intend to integrate our resources and develop a Collaborative Chemistry Laboratory Model (CCLM) for undergraduate chemistry that can address some common problems. Specifically, poor student performance in the chemistry gatekeeper courses may be due to poor inquiry skills (methodology and reasoning) and poor conceptual understanding of chemistry topics. These problems, in turn, may adversely influence progress in future science courses. The model is based upon the integration of constructivist learning theory with three interactive modes of technology that are designed to enhance experiences with a phenomenon and its representations. Microcomputer Based Laboratory (MBL), i.e., the NSF-funded LabWorks, allows student design of experiments, simultaneous observation of a phenomenon and its representations, and graphical analysis of its data. Interactive Multimedia Computer Simulations (IMCS), the Chemistry Explorer computer modeling and simulation from Riverdeep, expands student decision-making opportunities and allows visualization at the particulate level. We are adapting and integrating the use of the MBL and IMCS systems so that students can emulate the mental world of chemists when they couple the enhanced methodology of MBL with the conceptually rich microworld of IMCS. Online cooperative/collaborative learning methods are providing opportunities for students to share their experiences and ideas between the two universities. The CCLM is being tested in freshman chemistry laboratory courses and later will be implemented in advanced courses. The project involves 800 STEM students distributed within the two universities. Faculty development workshops are being used to share findings throughout the LS-LAMP network of 12 universities. Other methods of dissemination include web publications and professional conferences.</AbstractNarration>
