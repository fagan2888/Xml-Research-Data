    <AbstractNarration>0132901&lt;br/&gt;Har-Peled, Sariel&lt;br/&gt;U of Ill, Urbana-Champaign&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational geometry is the branch of theoretical computer science devoted to the design,&lt;br/&gt;analysis, and implementation of geometric algorithms and data structures. Computational&lt;br/&gt;geometry has deep roots in reality: Geometric problems arise naturally in any computa-&lt;br/&gt;tional field that simulates or interacts with the physical world|computer graphics, robotics,&lt;br/&gt;geographic information systems, computer aided-design, and molecular modeling, to name&lt;br/&gt;a few|as well as in more abstract domains such as combinatorial geometry and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;topology. Aside from their obvious practical significance, geometric algorithms and data&lt;br/&gt;structures enjoy a rich and satisfying mathematical structure, and their development often&lt;br/&gt;requires tools from mathematical disciplines such as combinatorics, topology, and algebraic&lt;br/&gt;geometry, as well as traditional computational tools.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal outlines a challenging career development plan focusing on research in a&lt;br/&gt;broad cross-section of computational geometry, building on and significantly broadening the&lt;br/&gt;PI's successful work in the field over the last several years. Specific problem areas in which&lt;br/&gt;the PI plans to work include approximation algorithms, kinetic data structures, spatial and&lt;br/&gt;temporal databases, external memory computation, geometric optimization, and clustering.&lt;br/&gt;This classification is at best a rough guide, as many interesting geometric problems fall&lt;br/&gt;into more than one category. Furthermore, the PI plans to continue combining theory and&lt;br/&gt;empirical experimentation in his work, putting an emphasize on algorithms that perform&lt;br/&gt;well in practice.</AbstractNarration>
