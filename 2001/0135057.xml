    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Timothy Warren, Department of Chemistry, Georgetown University is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program of the Division of Chemistry, National Science Foundation, for his work under a CAREER Award to establish a fundamental understanding of multiply-bound functional groups in later, first row complexes that participate in catalytic reactions involving cyclopropanation, aziridination and hydrocarbon oxidation. Dr. Warren will prepare carbene, nitrene and oxo complexes of Mn-Cu with a promising class of beta-diketiminate ligands in order to lend insight into these catalytic processes so as to enable the design of more efficient and selective catalysts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Warren has integrated research and education by developing a course, "Introduction to the Research Experience", that introduces motivated freshmen students to the research laboratory through a synthetic research project and plans to promote a better understanding of the scientific effort through a pilot outreach program to minority-serving DC high schools.</AbstractNarration>
