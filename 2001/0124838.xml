    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0124838&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: David Eisenbud&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Banff International Research Station (BIRS), supported by the&lt;br/&gt;Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley in&lt;br/&gt;collaboration with the Pacific Institute of the Mathematical&lt;br/&gt;Sciences in Vancouver, Canada, will provide an environment that&lt;br/&gt;optimizes creative interaction and the exchange of ideas,&lt;br/&gt;knowledge and methods within the mathematical sciences and with&lt;br/&gt;related sciences and industry. It is modeled on the extremely&lt;br/&gt;successful European mathematics centers in Oberwolfach and&lt;br/&gt;Luminy, and the US physics center in Aspen. It is a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative Canada-US venture. BIRS will pursue an extremely&lt;br/&gt;broad program, embracing all aspects of the mathematical&lt;br/&gt;sciences, from the most fundamental work on the great problems of&lt;br/&gt;algebra, geometry and analysis to modern pure and applied&lt;br/&gt;mathematics, theoretical and applied statistics, financial and&lt;br/&gt;industrial mathematics, the mathematics of information technology&lt;br/&gt;and computer science, and bio-mathematics. Conferences on math&lt;br/&gt;education, and Schools ranging in level from high-school to&lt;br/&gt;postgraduate will also be regular features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A conference center in Germany called Oberwolfach has played an&lt;br/&gt;enormously important role mathematics for more than half a&lt;br/&gt;century. Conferences there bring the greatest mathematicians&lt;br/&gt;from around the world to Germany, and this flow of people and&lt;br/&gt;ideas is often credited with aiding the quick recovery of German&lt;br/&gt;mathematics from the devastation it suffered during the war. It&lt;br/&gt;also helped by introducing generations of graduate students to&lt;br/&gt;the great men in their fields and to each other. The Oberwolfach&lt;br/&gt;model was so successful that the French eventually copied it at&lt;br/&gt;the center in Luminy. Senior US mathematicians are often&lt;br/&gt;visitors to these centers, but often graduate students and&lt;br/&gt;younger mathematicians from the United States and Canada are not&lt;br/&gt;invited, and there are many other ways in which those centers&lt;br/&gt;benefit Europe much more than the US. The physics center in Aspen&lt;br/&gt;has provided a resource for the US physics community that has&lt;br/&gt;provided related services, and the mathematicians who happen to&lt;br/&gt;have been involved have been impressed with what can be done in&lt;br/&gt;this mode. It has long been a dream of North American&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians to have a conference center of their own that&lt;br/&gt;would provide similar opportunities here, and the goal of the&lt;br/&gt;Banff International Research Station is to provide this important&lt;br/&gt;resource for mathematics and related fields.</AbstractNarration>
