    <AbstractNarration>Over the past five years, the Principal Ivestigator and student assistants have developed a series of Internet-based courses in a related set of undergraduate mathematics courses utilizing locally developed software for geometric visualization and for communication betwee students and instructors and among students. These new models for teaching and learning change the timing and the level of interactivity for instructors and students, and increase the ability of students to handle complex geometric phenomena. These innovations provide new models for teaching and learning which will be further developed, tested, and evaluated during the period of the proposal. The aim is to produce effective software that can be used in a wide variety of institutions with students at different levels, for mathematics and for its applications to physical science, computer science, and engineering.
