    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models for Kerogen Oxidation, the Carbon Cycle,&lt;br/&gt;and Atmospheric Oxygen over Phanerozoic Time&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Change over geologic time in the level of atmospheric oxygen is both a principal cause and principal effect of biological evolution, and, thus, study of such change is of interest to both the earth and biological sciences. One the four basic processes controlling the level of atmospheric O2 over time is the removal of O2 by the oxidative weathering of organic matter (kerogen) in sedimentary rocks. We propose to construct theoretical models to quantitatively evaluate the role of O2 in the rate and mechanism of kerogen weathering and help decide whether or not the rate limiting step in such weathering is simply the exposure of fresh kerogen by physical erosion. As a check on the modeling we will turn to the field measurements of kerogen weathering that have been done under our previous NSF grant.&lt;br/&gt; In addition, we propose to combine already existing simple models for the evolution of atmospheric O2 over the past 550 million years (Phanerozoic time) with an already published much more complex model for the evolution of atmospheric CO2 that considers such processes as mountain uplift, continental drift, and climate change. Combined with our model results on kerogen weathering, we hope to be able to construct a complete model for the evolution of both atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide and to relate changes in the two gases to biological evolution and climate change.</AbstractNarration>
