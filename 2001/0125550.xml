    <AbstractNarration>.0125550&lt;br/&gt;Kirchner&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The travel time of water through a catchment -- that is, the time it takes for rainfall to reach the stream -- is a fundamental hydraulic parameter controlling the persistence of soluble contaminants, and thus the downstream consequences of pollution episodes. A catchment is characterized by a distribution of travel times, reflecting the diverse flow paths that rainfall can take to the stream. Thus, quantifying catchments' travel time distributions should help to clarify the hydrologic mechanisms controlling flow routing in the subsurface. Understanding the timescales of transport and storage in catchments is also important for predicting how rainfall inputs will be chemically modified by reactions with catchment soils and bedrock. But despite the importance of catchment travel time distributions for watershed hydrology and geochemistry, they have rarely been quantified and the mechanisms controlling them are poorly understood. &lt;br/&gt; Catchment travel time distributions can be inferred from long-term time series of inert tracers, such as chloride, in rainfall and streamflow. It has recently been shown that catchment travel-time distributions can have unexpectedly long "tails", implying that they can retain soluble contaminants for much longer than would otherwise be expected [Kirchner, Feng, and Neal, Fractal stream chemistry and its implications for contaminant transport in catchments, Nature, 403, 524-527, 2000]. The proposed research program builds on this recent work, and has four main components:&lt;br/&gt;a) analyses of long-term time series of rainfall and streamflow concentrations of chloride (a naturally occurring nonreactive tracer) from humid forested catchments in diverse geological settings, using spectral, autocorrelation, and cross-correlation methods to infer each catchment's characteristic travel time distribution,&lt;br/&gt;b) development and testing of alternative conceptual models for the observed travel-time distributions, &lt;br/&gt;c) construction of laboratory-scale physical models to simulate the hypothesized mechanisms underlying these conceptual models, and&lt;br/&gt;d) analyses of reactive tracer data, to complement the passive tracer (chloride) studies.&lt;br/&gt; This integrated program of data analysis, conceptual modeling, and laboratory-scale physical models is designed to clarify the mechanisms that control catchment-scale transport, storage, and mixing of waters and their associated solutes. This project is expected to lead to:&lt;br/&gt;a) improved understanding of catchment flowpaths and travel time distributions, and the factors controlling them,&lt;br/&gt;b) improved understanding of how catchment flowpaths, and reactions between aqueous and solid phases, affect the mobility of reactive solutes at catchment scale,&lt;br/&gt;c) improved tools for using hydrologic and geochemical time series to probe the internal workings of catchments, and&lt;br/&gt;d) improved methods for testing catchment flow and routing models through comparisons with field data.</AbstractNarration>
