    <AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project from Learnimation (TM) will produce a browser-based assessment and feedback engine prototype that evaluates mathematical problem solving skills for students with learning disabilities. This assessment engine prototype will provide adaptive instruction in a learning environment designed to meet individual students' needs. It will also provide adaptive guidance to a student's teacher and caregiver. The importance of high level mathematical problem solving and reasoning and the assessment of these skills is emphasized for all students by the national standards-governing bodies in the United States (NCTM, AAAS, NRC), yet as many as 6% of all school age children have severe math deficits with very few tools at their disposal to help them gain fluency and measure accountability in an increasingly information-based society.&lt;br/&gt; This investigation will provide an alternative assessment platform for mathematics skill development designed specifically for learning disabilities and will ensure that all students with disabilities are included in the present national educational assessment reforms.</AbstractNarration>
