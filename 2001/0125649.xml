    <AbstractNarration>Mathematical Sciences (21). This project is creating materials presenting the structure of the hydrogen atom and the periodic table as a first example of the power of representation theory in predicting physical phenomena from information about symmetries. Despite the centrality of representation theory to modern mathematics, mathematical physics and physical chemistry, undergraduate courses in representation theory often ignore the physical applications. During this proof-of-concept project materials are being tested at a number of different institutions, and a modular approach is being incorporated into the materials development so as to broaden the appeal of the materials to an audience that includes disciplines outside of mathematics . A book on representation theory is planned and an arrangement is already in place with a leading publisher.</AbstractNarration>
