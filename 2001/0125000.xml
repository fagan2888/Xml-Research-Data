    <AbstractNarration>Sumners&lt;br/&gt;0125000&lt;br/&gt; The investigator and his colleagues in the Program in&lt;br/&gt;Mathematics and Molecular Biology (PMMB) organize an&lt;br/&gt;international conference on the subject of multiscale phenomena&lt;br/&gt;at the interface of the biological and mathematical sciences.&lt;br/&gt;This meeting includes a broadly multidisciplinary set of&lt;br/&gt;participants, students and researchers active at the interface&lt;br/&gt;between mathematics (broadly defined) and biology. This project&lt;br/&gt;supports the participation of approximately 15 domestic students&lt;br/&gt;and young scientists, selected from a national pool of applicants&lt;br/&gt;generated by web and journal advertisements for the meeting. An&lt;br/&gt;unusual feature of the meeting is an opening day of tutorials,&lt;br/&gt;which prepare the attendees for the lectures, with mathematical&lt;br/&gt;scientists introducing basic principles to biologists and&lt;br/&gt;biologists giving tutorials for the quantitative scientists. Two&lt;br/&gt;sessions focus on issues of importance to students working at the&lt;br/&gt;interface between the computational sciences and biology.&lt;br/&gt;Students are especially welcome to attend the meeting and present&lt;br/&gt;posters on their work.&lt;br/&gt; The Program in Mathematics and Molecular Biology (PMMB)&lt;br/&gt;conducts research at the interface between molecular biology and&lt;br/&gt;the mathematical sciences and trains students and postdocs in&lt;br/&gt;this area. An essential part of this effort is a series of&lt;br/&gt;conferences on mathematics and molecular biology. The meetings&lt;br/&gt;provide a comfortable but challenging environment where students&lt;br/&gt;and scientists from each discipline can learn about the other&lt;br/&gt;discipline and about multidisciplinary approaches to the solution&lt;br/&gt;of important problems in modern biology. This fosters&lt;br/&gt;interdisciplinary training, catalyzes new interdisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;collaborations, and in an important scientific area helps develop&lt;br/&gt;more people with both mathematics and biology expertise. The&lt;br/&gt;project supports students and junior scientists.</AbstractNarration>
