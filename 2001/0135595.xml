    <AbstractNarration>Extremely halophilic archaea inhabit brine pools containing 3-5 M NaCl, which are&lt;br/&gt;extraordinarily diverse and dynamic with respect to salinity, pH, temperature, pressure, nutrients,&lt;br/&gt;etc. In addition to their obligately halophilic character,some are also acidophilic, alkaliphilic,&lt;br/&gt;psychrophilic, barophilic, or slightly thermophilic. Extreme halophiles are easily cultured in the&lt;br/&gt;laboratory and are excellent experimental systems with well-developed genetic tools. However,&lt;br/&gt;thus far, only a single genome from an extremely halophilic archaeon, Halobacterium species&lt;br/&gt;NRC-1, has been sequenced. In order to study the genomic diversity of extreme halophiles, we&lt;br/&gt;plan to sequence the genome of Haloarcula marismortui, a metabolically versatile halophile with&lt;br/&gt;a high-resolution ribosome structure. If time and resources permit, additional genomic analysis&lt;br/&gt;will be conducted on diverse strains, including Natrialba asiatica, a non-pigmented alkaliphile.&lt;br/&gt;Halorubrum lacusprofundi, a psychrophile capable of growing at temperatures down to 4oC,&lt;br/&gt;Halosimplex carlsbadense, a likely ancient halophile recently isolated from a Permian brine&lt;br/&gt;inclusion, which appears to be a genetic chimera, and Halobacterium species GRB, a closely&lt;br/&gt;related strain to NRC-1. Sequencing will be conducted at the Institute for Systems Biology and&lt;br/&gt;annotation will be done at the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, Center of Marine&lt;br/&gt;Biotechnology. This project will provide better understanding of biodiversity among extreme&lt;br/&gt;halophiles, including genome structure and evolution, adaptation to extreme environments, and&lt;br/&gt;lateral gene transfer. In the long term, the proposed work should provide novel applications in&lt;br/&gt;biotechnology, e.g. engineering salt tolerance in crop plants and development of new antibiotics. This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative program between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems.</AbstractNarration>
