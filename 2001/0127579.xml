    <AbstractNarration>Interdisciplinary (99)&lt;br/&gt;Many problems in science, engineering, and mathematics are inherently spatial in nature. &lt;br/&gt;Examples are understanding and reasoning about atoms in a molecule, the design of mechanical &lt;br/&gt;and electronic systems such as robots, the layout of an integrated circuit or microelectronic&lt;br/&gt;mechanical chip, and the transmission of tension and compression forces in a structural&lt;br/&gt;system. These problems all demand the ability to visualize and reason spatially.&lt;br/&gt;Surprisingly, students of science and engineering are seldom taught these skills.&lt;br/&gt;Visual thinking and the ability to reason spatially can be taught and learned: indeed, this&lt;br/&gt;is a central component of architectural design education. We teach architects to manage&lt;br/&gt;and manipulate complex configurations of physical elements in space, and architectural&lt;br/&gt;educators have developed techniques for teaching this ability. In the past, the principal&lt;br/&gt;means for teaching spatial and visual thinking has been drawing and three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;model-making. Today interactive media and software tools augment these traditional&lt;br/&gt;methods. Based on experience with teaching visual skills to architectural designers we are&lt;br/&gt;developing a series of exercises that, as part of a course on visual and spatial reasoning, &lt;br/&gt;can enhance science, mathematics, and engineering education for undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;The exercises include drawing with pencil and paper as well as computational drawing&lt;br/&gt;media, physical as well as computer-graphics based three dimensional modeling,&lt;br/&gt;and techniques for shifting between computational and physical representations. We are&lt;br/&gt;testing these exercises in a course taught to first-year college students and assessing the &lt;br/&gt;learning experience using both formative and summative evaluations.</AbstractNarration>
