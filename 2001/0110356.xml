    <AbstractNarration>This award to WTEC, Inc. is for organization of a workshop at NSF in February 2001 that will provide a preliminary assessment of U.S. and international research activities in quantum information science. Quantum information science (QIS) is an emerging field of science and technology that draws on the disciplines of physical science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering. Its aim is to understand how fundamental laws of quantum mechanics can be harnessed to dramatically improve the acquisition, transmission, and processing of information. The exciting scientific opportunities offered by QIS are attracting the interest of a growing community of scientists and engineers, both nationally and internationally. Although the U.S. maintains a leadership role in this research, major centers of excellence exist abroad, principally in Japan, Europe, and Australia. The goal of the workshop is to gather information by a panel of U.S. experts for the purposes of planning a more extensive global study of QIS. Its scope is to identify the leading individuals, institutions, and centers of excellence in international research and development in the field. A full international technology assessment study may then be organized separately to complete the major study. Several Divisions in the Directorates for Engineering, for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and for Computer and Information Science and Engineering at NSF are supporting this award.</AbstractNarration>
