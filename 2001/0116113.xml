    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program will support Xavier University with the acquisition of a thin film deposition system for growth of thin films of materials (primarily metals) that range in thickness from tens of nanometers to several micrometers. Three main thrusts of research would benefit from this piece of equipment. These are: 1) the study of the electrical transport properties of superconductors and Josephson junction arrays; 2) the study of the growth and surface morphology of metal films; 3) and the study of the electrical properties of carbon nanotubes. Each of these areas requires metal films for sample fabrication and/or preparation. The deposition system is the next logical step in building existing infrastructure at the institution. In addition, the Xavier University Department of Physics requires all of its undergraduate majors to complete a senior research project. These research projects are usually consistent with, and often directly linked to faculty research program. This deposition system would significantly advance undergraduate education and training by offering viable avenues for undergraduate students to carry out their research requirement. Its use will expose students to an important experimental research tool, as well as to important sample fabrication techniques that are not taught in class but are learned through experience.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program will support Xavier University with the acquisition of a thin film deposition system for growth of thin films of materials (primarily metals) that range in thickness from tens of nanometers to several micrometers.
