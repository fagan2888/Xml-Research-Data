    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Darryl D. DesMarteau, III, Department of Chemistry, Clemson University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division for research into sulfonimides, sulfones and iodine Compounds. The research capitalizes on the unique properties of perfluoroalkylsulfonimides, a class of strong nitrogen acids, to stabilize unusual molecular structures and to promote unusual reactivity. The project has three main thrusts. First, a new class of zwitterionic diaryl iodonium salts containing both the anion and cation directly bound to the aromatic ring will be investigated. A variety of these compounds, which have a broad range of functionalization on the aromatic rings, will be prepared. These compounds have excellent potential for use in photolithography as photoacid generators and may aid in extending photolithography for integrated circuit manufacture to shorter wavelengths for smaller device geometries. Second, a novel iodonium compound that has the ability to selectively place a trifluoroethyl alkyl group onto an amino acid in a water solution will be used to prepare new, potentially bioactive compounds. Third, sulfonimides will be incorporated into dendrimer polymers to give the first examples of perfluorinated dendrimers. Parallel to this effort, a new functionalized crosslinking agent for ionene polymers will be developed in order to obtain higher molecular weights and decreased crystallinity, which will aid these species to form membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research combines fundamental chemical science with applications of importance in microelectronics, drug discovery, electrochemistry and catalysis. The systems selected for study have potential as polymer electrolytes in fuel cells and battery applications, as media in which nanoscale materials can be formed, and as polymer based reagents. One objective is the design of new catalysts for a number of `acid catalyzed` processes (petroleum refining, for example, often uses acidic catalysts). Another is to design ways to introduce fluorine into molecules that may have biochemical significance. This combination will provide an excellent platform to train undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students in basic research in the chemical sciences in technological areas of high current interest.</AbstractNarration>
