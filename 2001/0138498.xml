    <AbstractNarration>Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a medical imaging technique in which&lt;br/&gt;low levels of current are applied through electrodes on the surface of the&lt;br/&gt;body, the resulting voltage is measured on the electrodes, and an inverse&lt;br/&gt;problem is solved computationally to determine the conductivity distribution in&lt;br/&gt;the interior. In EIT the imaged region is often a cross-section of the body, such as&lt;br/&gt;a patient's chest. The tissues and organs in the body have different&lt;br/&gt;conductivities, a fact which enables one to form an image from the&lt;br/&gt;conductivity distribution. There is an essential interplay in EIT between &lt;br/&gt;engineering and mathematics. The design of a fast and accurate EIT system &lt;br/&gt;poses many engineering challenges. Mathematics has helped solve design issues &lt;br/&gt;such as what are the optimal current patterns to apply, what number and size of &lt;br/&gt;electrodes should be used, and what measurement precision is need to distinguish&lt;br/&gt;inhomogeneities. In order to image human processes in real time, the &lt;br/&gt;reconstruction algorithms that solve the inverse problem must be very efficient. &lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, for certain applications, such as distinguishing a breast tumor &lt;br/&gt;from a cyst, the reconstructed conductivity values must be accurate. The design &lt;br/&gt;of reconstruction algorithms draws on many areas of mathematics including &lt;br/&gt;partial differential equations, analysis and complex variables,&lt;br/&gt;mathematical modeling, numerical analysis, and scientific computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Mummy Range Workshop in Electrical Impedance Tomography is to &lt;br/&gt;bring together mathematicians, engineers, and physicians working in EIT to &lt;br/&gt;increase the communication between the groups and address current problems in &lt;br/&gt;design issues, applications, and reconstruction algorithms. To the organizers' &lt;br/&gt;knowledge, this is the first conference in EIT specifically designed to bring &lt;br/&gt;together these groups. The workshop will be held at the Pingree Park Campus of &lt;br/&gt;Colorado State University, a conference center located in the Mummy Range of &lt;br/&gt;the Rocky Mountains. By bringing these groups together, we hope to expand the&lt;br/&gt;clinical applications of EIT and push the technology forward in terms of system&lt;br/&gt;design and reconstruction algorithms. Several important existing clinical &lt;br/&gt;applications of EIT include monitoring heart and lung function, diagnosis of&lt;br/&gt;pulmonary embolis (a blood clot in the lung), diagnosis of pulmonary edema, &lt;br/&gt;monitoring for internal bleeding, and the early detection of breast cancer.&lt;br/&gt;Groups attending the workshop will be presenting work on these applications &lt;br/&gt;and others such as imaging changes in the brain during epilepsy and stroke &lt;br/&gt;and monitoring of cancer tissue during hyperthermia by impedance spectroscopy. &lt;br/&gt;Several groups are presenting work on the design of new systems for specific &lt;br/&gt;applications such as breast cancer detection, and novel reconstruction algorithms &lt;br/&gt;will be presented.
