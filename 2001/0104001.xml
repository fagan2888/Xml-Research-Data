    <AbstractNarration>Over the next five years, the Principal Investigator proposes &lt;br/&gt;to examine the mathematical issues and develop computational methods&lt;br/&gt;for solving the following classes of direct and inverse problems&lt;br/&gt;motivated by industrial applications: scattering and diffraction by periodic &lt;br/&gt;structures (gratings), second harmonic generation in nonlinear diffractive &lt;br/&gt;optics, and inverse and optimal design problems in diffractive optics. &lt;br/&gt;The main topics of the proposed work are as follows:&lt;br/&gt;-- Modeling, analysis, and computation of the diffraction by periodic &lt;br/&gt;chiral structures and the scattering by a perturbed diffractive structure. &lt;br/&gt;Modeling and design of electromagnetic resonances.&lt;br/&gt;-- Well-posedness of the nonlinear Maxwell equations in second harmonic&lt;br/&gt;generation. An interface least-squares finite element method for solving&lt;br/&gt;the three-dimensional model problem. Structure (grating)&lt;br/&gt; enhanced nonlinear optical effects. Effects of coatings on nonlinear &lt;br/&gt;diffractive optics.&lt;br/&gt;-- Optimal design of diffractive structures. A relaxation technique &lt;br/&gt;(homogenization) and a local approach for the optimal design problem. &lt;br/&gt;Uniqueness, stability, and regularity studies of the inverse diffraction &lt;br/&gt;problem. Numerical solution of inverse and optimal design problems in &lt;br/&gt;diffractive optics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent enabling technologies of high-performance computing facilities&lt;br/&gt;and microlithographic fabrication techniques have led to an explosion of&lt;br/&gt;applications of diffraction in optics, establishing diffractive optics &lt;br/&gt;as one of the most rapidly advancing areas of current research &lt;br/&gt;in optical engineering. The practical applications and scientific developments &lt;br/&gt;have driven the need for rigorous partial differential equation&lt;br/&gt;models, mathematical analysis, and numerical algorithms&lt;br/&gt;to describe the diffraction of complicated grating structures, to compute &lt;br/&gt;electromagnetic fields and thus to predict the performance of a given &lt;br/&gt;diffractive structure in linear, chiral, and nonlinear optical media, as well &lt;br/&gt;as to carry out optimal design of new structures. The proposed research has &lt;br/&gt;significant potential for evolving new mathematics and science and providing &lt;br/&gt;industry with guidance to design and fabricate new optical devices.</AbstractNarration>
