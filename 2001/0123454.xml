    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the development and implementation of a workshop for prospective and&lt;br/&gt;current female professors in science and engineering fields as part of the NSF&lt;br/&gt;ADVANCE Leadership Awards Program by a group of researchers from the George&lt;br/&gt;Washington University and Gallaudet University who have collaborated for the past five&lt;br/&gt;years on projects to increase the numbers of women and other underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;minorities in advanced Science, Engineering and Mathematics (SEM) careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using experience from earlier efforts to bring together students from different institutions, large and small, local and far away, specialized communities (e.g. women's colleges, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and comprehensive, to consider and be prepared for graduate&lt;br/&gt;school in science, engineering and math (SEM), the PIs propose to develop and run a similar&lt;br/&gt;workshop for potential and current female faculty members in SEM. The proposed activity will benefit from the pipeline created by the FORWARD program: participants from this program started in 1997 will be reaching graduation and the stage of securing a faculty position within the&lt;br/&gt;proposed timeline of the award. Participation will be solicited from across the country&lt;br/&gt;and will feature speakers from successful programs and careers in SEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE Program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>
