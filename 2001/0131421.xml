    <AbstractNarration>The ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila excises an estimated 6000 specific DNA segments from its somatic nucleus during development. This project aims to understand the regulation of this massive genome reorganization and ultimately learn fundamental principles governing chromosome structure and genetic stability. Understanding how particular DNA segments, called deletion elements, are selectively excised is challenged by the fact that they are quite diverse in size and sequence. The PI's approach toward understanding how the cell recognizes these diverse sequences has been to understand in detail the mechanism of deletion of two DNA segments, called the M and R deletion elements, and thus identify common regulatory properties. In this work, these elements will be mutagenized in order to identify the specific sequences that target these DNA segments for elimination. Mutant deletion elements will be integrated into the genome such that their excision can be monitored during the process. This will allow the determination of mutations in the identified cis-acting sequences that abolish the association between the element and proteins involved in excision. A major goal of these mutational analyses is to delimit the sequences that activate the non-genic transcription of deletion elements and determine whether transcription is required for DNA deletion. To further explore the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation of these DNA rearrangements, the minimal requirements for this regulation will be defined. Several prior genetic studies support a model that RNA copies of the element produced from parental nuclei act as inhibitory signals that block DNA deletion of the homologous element. This and other possible explanations will be tested. Combining studies that address both genetic and epigenetic regulatory components will expedite a comprehensive understanding of this process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates a process of regulated DNA rearrangement that occurs during development of the ciliated protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila. The cellular machinery that accurately rearranges the Tetrahymena genome likely involves many of the components that ensure the proper genetic stability of this organism. This research aims to understand how particular DNA segments are targeted for elimination. Its long-term goal is to learn how removal of these DNA segments affects the normal genetic stability of the somatic genome. Investigation of this process in Tetrahymena should provide fundamental insight into genetic mechanisms that operate in all organisms.</AbstractNarration>
