    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0104621&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algebraic-geometric theory of soliton equations developed in the middle &lt;br/&gt;seventies has become one of the most powerful tools in the theory of integrable&lt;br/&gt;models, and has had enormous influence on many branches of mathematics and &lt;br/&gt;theoretical physics. The main objective of the present project&lt;br/&gt;is a further development of this approach to integration of non-linear &lt;br/&gt;equations, models of solid state physics, and models of quantum field theories.&lt;br/&gt;An immediate goal is to construct integrable models corresponding&lt;br/&gt;to various supersymmetric gauge Seiber-Witten models, &lt;br/&gt;which can be instrumental in investigating key physical issues such as &lt;br/&gt;duality, the renormalization group, or instanton corrections.&lt;br/&gt;Another goal of the project is a classification of commuting difference &lt;br/&gt;operators. Particular attention will be paid to connection of this &lt;br/&gt;theory with the Hitchin system which is central in modern theory of &lt;br/&gt;the moduli space of vector bundles over algebraic curve.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent progress in understanding non-perturbative structures in &lt;br/&gt;supersymmetric gauge theories has shed new insight upon the role of &lt;br/&gt;integrable structures in modern theoretical physics.&lt;br/&gt;The nineteenth century saw many aspects of geometry and analysis,&lt;br/&gt;particularly the development of Abelian functions, drawn together in &lt;br/&gt;the study of integrable systems. The works of Jacobi, Abel, Riemann &lt;br/&gt;and Weierstrass enabled a number of important integrable&lt;br/&gt;problems of mechanics and physics to be solved. The modern discovery of &lt;br/&gt;soliton theory has led to a renewed interest to the theory of integrable &lt;br/&gt;systems. Nonlinear phenomena could now be treated, and the ever-growing &lt;br/&gt;interest in this theory is connected with the fact that it is applicable to &lt;br/&gt;equations which possess a remarkable universality property. They arise in the&lt;br/&gt;description of the most diverse phenomena in plasma physics, the theory of&lt;br/&gt;elementary particles, the theory of superconductivity and in nonlinear optics.&lt;br/&gt;Geometry and algebraic geometry, functional equations and special functions,&lt;br/&gt;Lie algebras and groups all come together in their study. This ubiquity of &lt;br/&gt;integrable systems together with the beautiful structures that underly them &lt;br/&gt;has been confirmed recently by discovery of unexpected relations between the &lt;br/&gt;Whitham perturbation theory of soliton equations developed in earlier works &lt;br/&gt;of the author and the Riemann mapping theorem. It seems urgent to develop &lt;br/&gt;methods which can identify various Whitham hierarchies with conformal maps &lt;br/&gt;for more general types of domains. A range of possible applications&lt;br/&gt;include flows in porous media, fundamental theory of pattern formation.</AbstractNarration>
