    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the Chemistry Department of Birmingham-Southern College, we are enriching the learning experience of our students by developing a new chemistry curriculum which includes more experiential, investigative laboratory exercises across the chemistry program. FT-NMR and other instruments in the department are used to demonstrate scientific problem solving through the use of modern instrumentation. Our goal is to improve students critical thinking skills by adapting and developing laboratory experiments that require them to develop protocols, collaborate in groups, and defend results in oral presentations. To accomplish this, we are adapting a number of experiments form the chemical education literature and implementing them as collaborative laboratory projects into the Organic, Physical, Biochemistry, Inorganic, and Advanced Analytical courses. Our department has already made significant progress in incorporating investigative laboratories into our curriculum and developing an active undergraduate research program. A second goal is to further continue this trend. An NMR spectrometer is critical for fulfilling this goal since it has become an essential tool in chemistry. Our students are exposed to NMR spectroscopy at all levels beginning with organic chemistry and culminating with independent research. With the completion of the Elton B. Stephens Science Center in the spring of 2002, and its significantly enhanced teaching and research facilities that better reflect our new way of teaching, we expect to see an increase in the number of students involved in the sciences and thus impacted by the new chemistry curriculum. We are also making the instrument available to Miles College, a small, historically black college in Fairfield, Alabama, for use in both teaching and research.</AbstractNarration>
