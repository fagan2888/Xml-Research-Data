    <AbstractNarration>Modern operating systems are large and complex code bases in which&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of programmer-years have been invested. As a result,&lt;br/&gt;modifying an operating system is a difficult, costly, and often&lt;br/&gt;impractical endeavor. However, viewing the OS as an immutable object&lt;br/&gt;is at odds with most OS research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research proposes techniques that enable the deployment of OS&lt;br/&gt;ideas without changing OS source code. The thesis is that an OS-like&lt;br/&gt;service can acquire information about the internal state of the OS and&lt;br/&gt;control its behavior, even when no explicit interfaces to do so are&lt;br/&gt;provided. With this approach, the OS is treated as a gray box, in&lt;br/&gt;which the general characteristics of its algorithms are known; this&lt;br/&gt;knowledge is then combined with run-time observations of how the OS reacts&lt;br/&gt;to probes in order to infer its state and exert control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Initial experience with gray-box systems points to additional areas of&lt;br/&gt;research: automated discovery of algorithms, on-line benchmarking to&lt;br/&gt;configure parameters, dynamic insertion of probes, and aggressive&lt;br/&gt;inference of OS internal state. Thus, the goal of this proposal is&lt;br/&gt;two-fold: to understand the theoretical foundations of gray-box&lt;br/&gt;systems and to implement a toolbox of software for the rapid&lt;br/&gt;development of gray-box systems.</AbstractNarration>
