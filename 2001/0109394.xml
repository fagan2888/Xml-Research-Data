    <AbstractNarration>International research interaction and exchange of ideas, particularly in the field of emerging technologies, is in the best interest of United States. Several NSF-sponsored workshops have concluded that thermal issues play an important role in many of the critical areas. NSF support is requested to partially support a team of US young scientists to visit India in January 2002 to participate in the Fifth ISHMT-ASME Heat and Mass Transfer Conference (Calcutta), jointly sponsored by the Indian Society of Heat and Mass Transfer and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The US scientists will also visit several premier institutions including the recently-established Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, and Bangladesh. It will help in developing new ties with Bangladesh Society of Mechanical Engineers. A diversified group of US researchers including graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and non-tenured faculty, will be partially supported from this grant, with special preference to under-represented groups. The visit will expand research interactions between the US and Indian scientists, build new contacts, improve our understanding of thermal science research and education in South Asia, and provide our young scientists with global perspectives of heat and mass transfer research.</AbstractNarration>
