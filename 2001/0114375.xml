    <AbstractNarration>This award supports the formation of The Center for Gravitational Wave&lt;br/&gt;Physics. This Physics Frontier Center is devoted to development of&lt;br/&gt;gravitational wave phenomenology: the physics and astrophysics that can&lt;br/&gt;be explored by gravitational wave observations in all wavebands. It is&lt;br/&gt;organized in three tightly-linked Major Research Components: i)&lt;br/&gt;learning how to exploit the fundamentally new perspective that gravitational&lt;br/&gt;waves offer, when compared to electromagnetic observations; ii) using&lt;br/&gt;gravitational wave observations to test and contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of strong-field, dynamical gravity; and iii) developing&lt;br/&gt;modeling tools that combine detector and source science to provide&lt;br/&gt;quantitative assessments of the ``science reach'' of advanced detector&lt;br/&gt;designs. To achieve its goal of crystalizing the formation of this new&lt;br/&gt;field, the Center functions as a National Facility with a substantial&lt;br/&gt;visitor program; workshops, conferences and institutes devoted to&lt;br/&gt;critical research areas where the focused attention of experts can be&lt;br/&gt;expected to lead to breakthroughs or rapid advancements; and a&lt;br/&gt;substantial, interactive interface to Center activities (seminar,&lt;br/&gt;colloquia, workshops and research group meetings) for off-site Center&lt;br/&gt;members and program participants. The Center's education program&lt;br/&gt;emphasizes middle school children nationwide, through an affiliation&lt;br/&gt;with the educational public television program "What's In The News?".&lt;br/&gt;Three special programs form the core of its outreach program: to&lt;br/&gt;women, through its participation in the Women In Science and&lt;br/&gt;Engineering "Expanding Your Horizons" workshop (focused on grades 7--9)&lt;br/&gt;and the Women In Science and Engineering Research mentoring program&lt;br/&gt;(focused on first and second year undergraduate women), and to upper&lt;br/&gt;division and graduate Hispanic students, through a special liaison with&lt;br/&gt;the University of Texas, Brownsville.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The forthcoming generation of ground and space-based gravitational wave&lt;br/&gt;detectors have unleashed exciting challenges and opportunities at the&lt;br/&gt;interface of general relativity, astrophysics, and experimental&lt;br/&gt;physics. The waves they will detect arise in strong, dynamical&lt;br/&gt;gravitational fields, offering the first opportunities to test the&lt;br/&gt;understanding of fully non-linear relativistic gravity.&lt;br/&gt;Simultaneously, the observations' astrophysical implications are likely&lt;br/&gt;to be novel, diverse and rich as they reveal the inner dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;processes hidden from electromagnetic astronomy: e.g., the collision of&lt;br/&gt;black holes in the center of a galaxy at high redshift. A new field of&lt;br/&gt;physics --- gravitational wave phenomenology --- is thus poised to&lt;br/&gt;emerge; however, lacking a tradition of large experiments,&lt;br/&gt;gravitational physics lacks also a community of phenomenologists ready&lt;br/&gt;to fully exploit the rich physics that the forthcoming observations&lt;br/&gt;offer. The Center for Gravitational Wave Physics provides the&lt;br/&gt;intellectual platform upon which existing expertise can be combined and&lt;br/&gt;focused in a synergistic manner, crystallizing the formation of a&lt;br/&gt;coherent, flourishing field that can fully realize the promise that&lt;br/&gt;gravitational wave observations hold.</AbstractNarration>
