    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Instrumentation Program is for the acquisition of a confocal microscope at Harvard University. This confocal microscope will be the heart of a state-of-the-art optical microscopy facility which will be a core component of the Center for Imaging and Mesoscopic Structures (CIMS), recently established at Harvard University as part of a general initiative of renewed support for the sciences. The facility will provide the Harvard research community with a complete range of modern optical microscopy that will enable optical imaging with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity. This will facilitate a broad range of new research, and will help establish new interdisciplinary research programs at Harvard University, bridging the disciplines of chemistry, physics, engineering, materials science, biology and medicine. This will help meet the important educational aim of CIMS, and this facility, which is to ensure that students become skilled in state-of-the-art microscopy, and are well versed in interdisciplinary collaboration. The research to be conducted ranges from materials science to biology, from synthesis of novel structured materials to probing single macromolecules inside living cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Instrumentation Program will help Harvard University with the acquisition of a confocal microscope.
