    <AbstractNarration>"Addressing Accessibility in Mathematics, Phase 2" is a three-year Professional Development Materials project. Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), in partnership with CAST, proposes to create professional development materials to help teachers enable all students, including those with cognitive, sensory, physical and emotional disabilities, to be successful with standards-based, middle-school mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work is based on a two-year NSF "proof of concept" project (Addressing Accessibility in Middle School Mathematics, Phase 1). The proposed materials comprise six components: (1) an Accessibility Toolkit, (2) Workshop Modules, (3) Collaborative Planning Group Resources, (4) an Addressing Accessibility Implementation Guide, (5) a Guide for Writing Accessible Mathematics Curriculum, and (6) an Addressing Accessibility Website. The project's audience will be mathematics and special-education teachers, school and district leaders, professional-development and technical-assistance providers, curriculum developers and publishers because each is a key stakeholder in ensuring that students with disabilities receive the best possible mathematics education.</AbstractNarration>
