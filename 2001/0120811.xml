    <AbstractNarration>The Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of having data on the Web defined and linked in a way that it can be used by computers not just for display purposes, but for automation, integration and reuse of data across various applications. The goal of the International Semantic Web Working Symposium (SWWS) (July 30-August 1, Stanford, California) is to bring together researchers and practitioners (1) to present the state-of-the-art in the development of the Semantic Web; (2) to examine the research issues that relate to the different components of what constitutes the Semantic Web technology; (3) to cross-fertilize ideas on the development of Semantic Web information systems among different domains. SWWS is both the first workshop on this topic in North America and the first one sponsored or in corporation with three major funding agencies from the U.S. and from Europe, namely NSF, DARPA, and the European Commission. It also has strong ties with the W3C Semantic Web Activity. The expected outcome of the workshop is a better common knowledge and synergy for those wishing to develop new exciting basic technology and applications for the Semantic Web. It should guide the future cooperation for enabling future standards to be adopted worldwide. A written report will be produced following the workshop, summarizing the main conclusions and research directions to follow, which will be published at http://www.semanticweb.org/SWWS/. We expect that this workshop and the follow-up report can serve as guidance for future international collaboration in research projects on the Semantic Web topic.</AbstractNarration>
