    <AbstractNarration>This proposal requests a grant of 43.500 in student support of the 2001 Gordon Research Conference on Nonlinear Optics and Lasers to be held at the Colby-Sawyer College, New London, New Hampshire. July 29 - August 3, 2001. The field of nonlinear optics and lasers has been and continues to be an extremely active and fruitful area of both basic and applied research. Recent Nobel Prizes in laser cooling, femtosecond chemistry, and laser diodes attest to its impact on science. The recent explosive growth of the telecommunications indusiry attest to its impact on our economy and also our daily lives. As in previous years. the purpose of this conference is to provide an informal forum for the presentation and discussion of new work on selected topics in nonlinear optics, quanium electronics and lasers, and their applications to physics, chemistry and engineering, both in academe and in industry. An informal atmosphere with a strong emphasis on discussion and interactions is intended to encourage the exchange of ideas in a manner not possible at regular meetings of professional societies. Students in particular benefit from these opportunities. A total attendance of approximately 100 scientists and students from universities, industry and government is anticipated. Participation at the conference is limited to under 135. to preserve the informal atmosphere and increase the level of interactions. It is proposed that the estimated total expense for the conference of $30,000 be shared by the National Science Foundation (43,500), the funds supplied by the Gordon Conference ($19,000). and funds to be solicited from other sources ($7,500). The National Science Foundation funds will be used to support selected graduate students who, because of limitations of their own sources of funding, require financial assistance to attend the conference. No honoraria will be paid to speakers at the conference.</AbstractNarration>
