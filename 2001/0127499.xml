    <AbstractNarration>Engineering - Chemical (53)&lt;br/&gt;We have developed and deployed a number of virtual unit operations lab projects. Our lab-based units have been developed to pose open-ended "what if" design problems by having students work on real time chemical processes. These chemical processes will include distillation and polymer crystallization for example. This will enable student on our campus as well as students from other campuses, colleges and high schools, to gain experience on a wide range of design, scale-up, and start-up problems generated by these laboratory projects. We hope to have students gain access to experiments that would not otherwise be available to them. These experiments can be used either in a classroom or lecture setting. Development efforts have involved collaboration between faculty at John Hopkins University and MIT.</AbstractNarration>
