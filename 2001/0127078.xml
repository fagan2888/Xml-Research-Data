    <AbstractNarration>Physics (13)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is restructuring the modern physics laboratory course at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne to provide students with experience with in-depth investigations. Six tracks of four experiments each are being developed. These tracks are (1) Lasers and Spectroscopy I, (2) Interferometry and Fourier Analysis, (3) Lasers and Spectroscopy II, (4) Magnetic Resonance, (5) Nuclear Spectroscopy, and (6) Molecular Spectroscopy. The experiments within a track use the same, or similar, equipment and concepts throughout. This allows students to become sufficiently familiar with the concepts and equipment so that they can be given more responsibility and freedom as they proceed through the track to design the investigation, collect appropriate data, and analyze the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is adapting and implementing four major elements. (1) It is adapting procedures for fostering independence in experimental design and analysis learned from a Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) project conducted by co-PIs Masters and Maloney (Award No. 9950511, "Improving Conceptual Understanding and Complex Problem Solving in General Physics"). (2) From professional practice, the project is adapting the practice of having students present poster sessions to classmates and faculty. (3) Also from professional practice, the project is implementing LabView software to introduce students to a standard of the industrial workplace. (4) The project is adapting much of the software from the Visual Quantum Mechanics project (Award No. 9452782) as an independent study resource for students.</AbstractNarration>
