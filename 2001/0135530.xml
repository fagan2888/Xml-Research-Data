    <AbstractNarration>We propose to hold a two-day workshop in Tucson, Arizona during fall 2001 on emerging ultra-large&lt;br/&gt;networks, such as the Internet. Hosted by Arizona Center for Integrative Modeling and Simulation, the&lt;br/&gt;meeting will bring together some of the world's leading researchers in the networking area to meet with&lt;br/&gt;counterparts with expertise in modeling and simulation of networks and of systems more generally. The&lt;br/&gt;workshop will provide these researchers with the task of coming up with the unknowns of ultra-large&lt;br/&gt;networks and with new directions of research in modeling and simulation that can address these unknowns.&lt;br/&gt; The Internet is increasing in connectivity, toward 1 billion nodes in 2005 and node capability providing a&lt;br/&gt;highly interconnected and computationally powerful medium. Such a globally and ubiquitously dispersed&lt;br/&gt;network will provide a new frontier for new kinds of educational, commerce and entertainment activities.&lt;br/&gt;However, there are many issues that arise in the emergence of such a large, highly decentralized, collection&lt;br/&gt;of interaction parts. The increased connectivity and capability creates new complexity and dynamics that&lt;br/&gt;we are only on the verge of appreciating. Difficulties in dealing with large-scale software systems are well&lt;br/&gt;documented in a recent report by the National Research Council. Techniques that work for small software&lt;br/&gt;systems fail markedly when the scale is increased by one million fold. Computer-based modeling and&lt;br/&gt;simulation (M&amp;S) methodology is required to address these issues since the scale is well beyond what&lt;br/&gt;analytical tools alone can handle and there is limited ability to do controlled experiments on the always&lt;br/&gt;on Internet. Traditional M&amp;S approaches have focussed on the micro-level components rather than the&lt;br/&gt;macro level integration of these components. However, with the advent of ultra-large scale systems such as&lt;br/&gt;the Internet of the future, it is necessary to develop M&amp;S approaches for understanding the behaviors of&lt;br/&gt;very large inter-connected networks with very few loci of control and many interacting and varied sources&lt;br/&gt;of input and services demand.&lt;br/&gt; The results of this workshop are expected to be a set of specific finding of gaps in our knowledge of the&lt;br/&gt;behavior of ultra-large networks and how to deal with their design, management, and control. Participants&lt;br/&gt;may assess whether current approaches can be evolved to deal with the large increases in scale or whether&lt;br/&gt;different, revolutionary paradigms are required. Participants will address the need for new techniques and&lt;br/&gt;approaches for building models of ultra-large networks and developing simulation environments for&lt;br/&gt;studying their behaviors. Suggestions for borrowing points of view form other areas such as complex&lt;br/&gt;adaptive systems and from basic theory of modeling and simulation will be encouraged. The proceedings&lt;br/&gt;will be compiled in a form that will provide a useable and significant guide for new NSF funding initiatives&lt;br/&gt;for future network infrastructure research.</AbstractNarration>
