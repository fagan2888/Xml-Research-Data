    <AbstractNarration>The project is taking a four pronged approach to helping Indiana University of Pennsylvania achieve Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education at the undergraduate level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Faculty Development through faculty workshops conducted by Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education James Madison University in which faculty develop and deliver computer security modules that can be readily included in core courses in Computer Science, Management Information Systems, Criminology, Educational Technology and IT as well as forming part of an Interdisciplinary Security minor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Curriculum Development to increase the security content in computing and criminology courses via addition of security modules in core courses, as well as through an interdisciplinary minor in Information Assurance and an upper level security track for computer science students who wish to specialize.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Strengthening Research and Internship opportunities in Information Assurance through creation of the Center for Applied Security involving a strategic partnership with the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), which has as its goal to develop and deliver information protection/assurance (IPA)&lt;br/&gt;services in our region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Providing the Technology for research in Information Assurance through a state of the art lab used for hands on labs, and for experimentation with new threats and vulnerabilities.</AbstractNarration>
