    <AbstractNarration>Chemistry (12)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The chemistry laboratory curriculum is being transformed and revitalized by the introduction of context-based experiments that emphasize critical thinking and that challenge students with real-world problems. Students are also being provided with service learning opportunities. From these activities, the students are understanding the role of chemistry in our society, particularly toward solving environmental issues, the capabilities and limitations of modern instrumentation and technology, and building connections with their community. These laboratory experiences are being adapted from the educational and research literature and are being implemented in part through the use of a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) and a Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer. Teams of students from lower and upper division laboratory courses including Environmental, Analytical, Instrumental, and Organic Chemistry and Physical Science for pre-service teachers are investigating environmental issues related to protecting and sustaining natural resources on a nearby Native American Reservation. As a consequence of the inquiry-based laboratories and their service-learning component, students are focussing on the scientific process and the significance of results, rather than following cookbook-type experiments.</AbstractNarration>
