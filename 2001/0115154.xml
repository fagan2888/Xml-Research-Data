    <AbstractNarration>This project the publication of a book tentatively titled "Beyond inertia: the transformation of mechanics in the seventeenth century." In that century the boundaries of mechanics were greatly expanded to include the study of motion and other areas. The study covers all areas of mechanics as it was understood at different times in the century, not just the motion of projectiles and celestial bodies. Therefore, the project investigates the science of waters and the resistance of materials. The project's methods pay close attention to the role of experiments, especially quantitative experiments, and to the mathematics employed. The best way to capture the wealth of domains progressively incorporated is to focus on the objects studied by scholars, including: the lever; the inclined plane; the pendulum; beams; canals; falling, projected, and colliding bodies; slings; springs; vibrating cords; pierced cisterns; hanging chains; bodies moving in resisting media; planets, satellites, and comets. These objects were studied empirically, including their material characteristics, and in abstract form. The study of the tensions between material and abstract objects is one of the defining methodological features of the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study covers a major transition period in the history of the mathematical disciplines. The topic is one of the classical elements of the history of science and has been widely examined in history of science courses. Indeed, it is so important as to be often the object of specialized courses, besides being included in all history of science surveys. However, there is no recent or reliable monograph on this central topic. The project advances both knowledge and science education because the book is aimed at both scholars in the field and graduate students. The incorporation of technical material in appendices makes the main portion of the book accessible to a wide audience.</AbstractNarration>
