    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS-0104039&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Darren Long&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposers plan to continue their work on a variety of&lt;br/&gt;problems bearing on the understanding of the geometric and&lt;br/&gt;topological aspects of low dimensional manifolds. On the&lt;br/&gt;topological side, the areas of study include Heegaard splittings,&lt;br/&gt;unknotting tunnels and related topics; the geometric side deals&lt;br/&gt;with issues related to orbifolds, the construction and melding of&lt;br/&gt;surface subgroups, developing an understanding of higher&lt;br/&gt;dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, as well as some interactions&lt;br/&gt;with other areas, for example algebraic number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Manifolds play a central role in physics, mathematics and to some&lt;br/&gt;extent in other sciences, since they are objects which on small&lt;br/&gt;scales look like Euclidean space of dimension n. For example,&lt;br/&gt;the space that we live in is a three manifold and space-time is a&lt;br/&gt;four manifold. For this and other reasons, these dimensions have&lt;br/&gt;attracted a good deal of attention in mathematics and physics.&lt;br/&gt;One basic unsolved problem is exactly which manifold is the&lt;br/&gt;correct model for the universe - there has been some speculation&lt;br/&gt;that it falls into the class of so-called hyperbolic manifolds, a&lt;br/&gt;certain class of three dimensional spaces which in some sense&lt;br/&gt;appear to be generic. Cosmological theories about the origins of&lt;br/&gt;the universe put constraints on the shape of space-time and hence&lt;br/&gt;constraints on which manifolds could occur. One of the goals of&lt;br/&gt;this project is refine current methods (which have already ruled&lt;br/&gt;out many possibilities) to narrow the search down further. There&lt;br/&gt;are also other applications of geometric ideas which are less&lt;br/&gt;obvious but still, in fact, directly important. It is no&lt;br/&gt;exaggeration to say that almost any problem which can be&lt;br/&gt;formulated qualitatively can be studied with geometric methods&lt;br/&gt;and as a result the powerful tools developed over the last thirty&lt;br/&gt;years in low-dimensional topology can be brought to bear upon it.</AbstractNarration>
