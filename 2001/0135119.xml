    <AbstractNarration>CAREER&lt;br/&gt;Garnero&lt;br/&gt;0135119&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes a long-term research directive for studying &lt;br/&gt;Earth's deep interior and related activities in science education in &lt;br/&gt;seismology and geophysics. An undergraduate and graduate course in &lt;br/&gt;seismology will be developed in Arizona State University's Department &lt;br/&gt;of Geological Sciences, a department that has experienced recent &lt;br/&gt;expansion in geophysics/seismology. Many topics in seismology are &lt;br/&gt;beyond the scope of an undergraduate course that uses traditional &lt;br/&gt;lecturing approaches. The new courses will utilize more three &lt;br/&gt;dimensional visualizations using computer imaging and animation, &lt;br/&gt;along with more interactive learning methods and analogies. Both the &lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate course will utilize already in-house &lt;br/&gt;research tools to study aspects of seismic data from recent and past &lt;br/&gt;relevant earthquakes. Emphasis on individual student and group &lt;br/&gt;discovery will be emphasized in both classes. Research activities for &lt;br/&gt;the proposed period focus on seismic studies of Earth's interior, &lt;br/&gt;with emphasis on the deep mantle. Three main areas of focus are: (1) &lt;br/&gt;determination of seismic heterogeneity, which is used to infer &lt;br/&gt;thermal and/or chemical heterogeneity; (2) detection and &lt;br/&gt;characterization of seismic wave speed anisotropy, which is related &lt;br/&gt;to rheology, dynamics, and flow in the mantle; and (3) detection and &lt;br/&gt;mapping of boundary layers and/or discontinuities in seismic &lt;br/&gt;properties, which may relate to chemical or phase boundaries in the &lt;br/&gt;Earth. The proposed work utilizes travel time and waveform analyses &lt;br/&gt;of relevant seismic waves and tomographic analyses, and will utilize &lt;br/&gt;two state of the art computer labs in the department, which are both &lt;br/&gt;outfitted with modern PC and UNIX computers. Research efforts &lt;br/&gt;characterizing heterogeneity, anisotropy, and boundary layering will &lt;br/&gt;include 2- and 3-D travel time and waveform analysis and propagation &lt;br/&gt;tools, an important next step in deep Earth seismology.&lt;br/&gt;--</AbstractNarration>
