    <AbstractNarration>Improving the publics" understanding of the scientific enterprise and improving scientific&lt;br/&gt;literacy have been identified as critical goals in the United States. Science learning&lt;br/&gt;occurs in formal (i.e. classroom) as well as in informal (i.e. backyards) settings and there&lt;br/&gt;are likely to be, at least, qualitative differences in outcomes between these learning&lt;br/&gt;environments. It is critical that scientists collaborate with professional science educators&lt;br/&gt;not only to identify the components of scientific literacy, but also to understand how&lt;br/&gt;learning occurs in these different settings and to help provide this information to other&lt;br/&gt;scientists and educators who will be ultimately responsible for the education of the&lt;br/&gt;population in both formal and informal settings. This proposal seeks funding to continue&lt;br/&gt;and complete the important research that I began as a National Science Foundation&lt;br/&gt;PFSMETE Fellow and to support the preliminary research and development of two other&lt;br/&gt;projects that have resulted directly from my post-doctoral position. For the former, I am&lt;br/&gt;proposing to analyze, present and publish my ongoing work on understanding the factors&lt;br/&gt;that most affect student attitudes and motivation in an established Student/Scientist&lt;br/&gt;Partnership, Forest Watch. The new projects include a study of the effects of a&lt;br/&gt;community data collection program called Neighborhood Nestwatch on scientific literacy&lt;br/&gt;in participants, and the development and implementation of two environmental education&lt;br/&gt;courses at Paul Smith's College that will be the cornerstones for the creation of an&lt;br/&gt;environmental science education emphasis within the Natural Resource Bachelor of&lt;br/&gt;Science degree.</AbstractNarration>
