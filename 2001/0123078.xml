    <AbstractNarration>The Connecticut College NSF Math and Computer Science Scholarship Program has three primary objectives: to enhance both the quantity and quality of students entering our existing math and computer science program, especially those from underrepresented minorities such as women and students of color; to increase retention of students who are enrolled in the math and computer science programs through extensive support services and through programs which increase the knowledge and skills of the students; and to expand the number of high school students considering math and computer science as career options by encouraging the scholarship students to become leaders and role models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship program specifically targets high school students, especially women and ethnic and racial minorities, with an interest in or an aptitude for math and computer science. Students in this program are mentored by faculty advisors in their field and by alumni or others in the local community with related careers. The students obtain applied skills through participation in internships, independent studies, and math practicums. In addition, they present results of their work at conferences, open houses, and to others outside the department. They learn leadership and teaching skills through work-study appointments in the Math and Computer Science Help Centers or in Information Services, as well as from the experience of mentoring incoming students. Finally, students in this program are guided toward appropriate job placement or graduate school by career counselors.</AbstractNarration>
