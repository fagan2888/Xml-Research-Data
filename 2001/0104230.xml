    <AbstractNarration>0104230&lt;br/&gt;Gutierrez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Americas Program award will provide support for cooperative research between Dr. Gaston Gutierrez of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and Dr. Marcos A. Reyes Santos of the Universidad Michoacana in Morelia, Mexico, on a project entitled "Search for Glueballs in High Energy Central Reactions."&lt;br/&gt;A fundamental objective of all particle physics research is to understand the interactions of the basic forms of matter and their structure. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is currently the leading theory governing the structure and interactions of particles subject to the nuclear force. A unique feature of QCD is that the force carrier, called gluons, may form bound states known as glueballs. At present, there is little experimental evidence about such states. This proposal will allow the collaborators to analyze existing Fermilab data (Experiment 690), which was collected using an 800 GeV proton beam on a liquid hydrogen target. The results of this analysis will serve to confirm the existence of glueballs in various reactions and increase our understanding of elementary particle physics.</AbstractNarration>
