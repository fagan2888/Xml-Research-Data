    <AbstractNarration>0138172&lt;br/&gt;Angell&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Description: This award provides travel support for 20 American participants at the US-India Workshop: Viscous Liquids and the Glass Transition, Bangalore, India, January 2002. US PI Austen Angell, Arizona State University and Srikanth Sastry and Chandan Dasgupta, Indian Institute of Science, are organizers for a workshop on transition from mobile liquid to glassy solid, a subject of much current debate and an important unsolved problem of condensed matter physics. They will convene leading international physicists and experts in the related areas of granular matter, foams, spin glasses and vortex glasses to discuss problem boundaries and explore a series of well-defined themes. US participants were selected on the basis of their valuable contributions to this research area and for their importance to future progress. The scope of the workshop is exploration of six themes that have generated the current wave of interest on glass transition in structural glasses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scope: The US PI is one of the world's leading scientists in this field. Some of the most active contributing scientists to research in this field are Indian nationals. The workshop will take advantage of the presence in India of theorists attending concurrent statistical physics and condensed matter physics conferences. The Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, the workshop venue, has a long history of achievement in physics and materials research, including those of Indian Nobel Laureate C.V. Raman and CNR Rao. Indian hosts will meet local costs for US participants; the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research jointly support this activity.</AbstractNarration>
