    <AbstractNarration>Under this Major Research Instrumentation award the Principal Investigator will acquire a high-performance computer cluster to be used as the primary computational resource for the mesoscale dynamics and numerical modeling group within the Division of Atmospheric Sciences (DAS) at the University of Nevada. The recent expansion of DAS's research scope including two National Science Foundation funded projects focusing on mesoscale atmospheric phenomena and mesoscale numerical modeling has led to an immediate need for dedicated computational resources to better support present and planned research activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of a 32-node computer cluster will be a significant and cost-effective expansion of the research infrastructure at DAS. Such a dedicated, high-speed computing platform will provide supercomputer performance at a fraction of the cost of a commercial supercomputer, and is crucial for the numerical modeling group and associated students to continue to conduct competitive research aimed at improving numerical weather forecasting within current and future projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The graduate student research training is an important part of the research enterprise at DRI. The requested equipment will provide an environment to extensively train students pursuing advanced degrees in the Atmospheric Sciences Program. It will foster a closer collaboration between the Computer and Atmospheric Science Departments. In the long term, the equipment is expected to provide a focal point for interdisciplinary collaboration and, especially, facilitate a wider adoption of high-performance parallel computing in earth sciences at the University of Nevada.</AbstractNarration>
