    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation and Research (SBIR) Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of using an agitation device based on a resonating elastic member for dispersing and coalescing immiscible liquids. This will have a significant impact in the liquid processing for solvent extraction of metals. The proposed technology offers a mixing regime that promotes high mass transfer, yet easy disengagement between immiscible liquids by forming uniform droplet dispersions and creating interfacial activity that increases mass transport. The post-contact phase disengagement can be further enhanced by applying higher frequency energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The near term commercial application would be presented by the changing technological landscape of the international mining and metals industries. The shift to leaching technology has created a need for advanced solvent extraction equipment. Applications also exist in the pharmaceutical industry, where solvent extraction is an entrenched and accepted approach to recovering products from microbial fermentation broths.</AbstractNarration>
