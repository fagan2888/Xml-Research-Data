    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will design a prototype for a rapid-deployment, three-dimensional (3-D), seismic reflection system for shallow subsurface exploration. Although the 3-D seismic reflection method enjoys tremendous commercial success in marine applications, 3-D seismic systems for land-based geophysical exploration have been limited because cost-effective and environmentally friendly deployment systems have not been developed. Such a system would be useful to build models of ground water flow, track pollutants, identify mineral-laden zones, and aid the siting of large construction projects. The customer base for this seismic reflection system includes civil and environmental engineers and geophysical contractors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PFM Manufacturing and Montana Tech propose to design a rapid-deployment, 3- D, seismic reflection system that employs multiple land streamers with gimbal-mounted vertical geophones. An industrial, low-impact All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) is a critical part of the system both to pull the land streamers and minimize environmental impact. PFM builds an ideal ATV for this purpose. The primary advantage of such a system is that fewer field personnel would be needed compared to conventional surveys and data could be collected more efficiently.</AbstractNarration>
