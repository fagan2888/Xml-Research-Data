    <AbstractNarration>Using assessment as the entry point, the Mathematics Assessment Resources Service (MARS) group at Michigan State University, University of California-Berkeley and the Shell Center at the University of Nottingham will create a set of assessment-related "tools" for educators engaged in reforming mathematics education in K-12 schools. Using a process of "co-development" with participating client systems (e.g., New York City, Clark County, Pittsburgh, El Paso, El Centro, Rhode Island) the project will create a set of specific tools that address critical issues such as how to use assessment information productively, designing effective professional development support around assessment and communicating effectively with parents about data and testing. The process of tool identification and development has been pilot-tested through a prior grant.</AbstractNarration>
