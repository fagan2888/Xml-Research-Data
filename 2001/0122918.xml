    <AbstractNarration>Lehigh Carbon Community College (LCCC) is providing scholarships each year to&lt;br/&gt;approximately 36 to 50 academically talented, financially needy full-time students enrolled in&lt;br/&gt;associate degree programs in the fields of computer science, computer technology, engineering,&lt;br/&gt;engineering technology, and mathematics. These CSEMS scholarships enable students, including those from underrepresented groups, to reduce their dependence on loans to meet their living expenses and decrease the number of hours they work, allowing them more time to study and receive support services in very demanding disciplines. The scholarships are also an incentive for part-time students to enroll full time and for students in one-year certificate programs to change their major to an associate degree program.</AbstractNarration>
