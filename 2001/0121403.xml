    <AbstractNarration>Formal logic is an extremely powerful and general conceptual tool that&lt;br/&gt;can be made even more useful if it can be manipulated computationally.&lt;br/&gt;Since computational logic is often difficult to implement and&lt;br/&gt;computationally expensive, progress on automating it has lagged&lt;br/&gt;somewhat. However, the problems and their solutions are becoming&lt;br/&gt;better understood and computational power has continued to advance&lt;br/&gt;exponentially, so the possibility of developing practical&lt;br/&gt;computational solutions to many interesting logic problems is now&lt;br/&gt;potentially solvable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are three themes to the project: computational logic components,&lt;br/&gt;educational applications, and systems applications. The first theme&lt;br/&gt;encompasses both the theoretical research and implementation work&lt;br/&gt;necessary to develop practical software components for manipulating&lt;br/&gt;logical representations at several levels of abstraction, including&lt;br/&gt;decision procedures for fragments of first order logic and automated&lt;br/&gt;deduction for first-order logic. The second theme involves the use of&lt;br/&gt;computational logic for computer-assisted analysis of designs in three&lt;br/&gt;application areas of critical importance: networking, hybrid systems,&lt;br/&gt;and computer security. The third theme is the development and use in&lt;br/&gt;the classroom of instructional courseware for mathematical concepts&lt;br/&gt;relevant to computer science. This work is in collaboration with&lt;br/&gt;Stanford's Educational Program for Gifted Children (EPGY).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this work follows from making computational logic&lt;br/&gt;accessible and available. Computational logic components will make it&lt;br/&gt;easier to construct sophisticated software applications, by providing&lt;br/&gt;powerful off-the-shelf building blocks for solving problems that would&lt;br/&gt;not otherwise be tractable. Improved analysis tools and techniques&lt;br/&gt;will result in superior system designs achieved faster and at lower&lt;br/&gt;cost. Instructional software will enhance the sophistication and&lt;br/&gt;problem-solving abilities of computer science students.</AbstractNarration>
