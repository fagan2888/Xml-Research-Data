    <AbstractNarration>Karin Ruhlandt-Senge, Department of Chemistry, Syracuse University, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry Program for her work with organometallic complexes of calcium, strontium and barium. Sigma-bonded alkyls, aryls and thiolates can be prepared and studied by using ancillary ligands that can stabilize these large, highly electrophilic metal centers. One important goal of this work is to obtain details about the ionic or covalent character of the metal-carbon or metal-sulfur bond and to investigate periodic trends down the alkaline earth family. Another goal is to exploit the unique reactivity of these complexes to prepare desirable organic structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental studies of bonding and reactivity of these alkaline earth compounds will lead to an increased understanding of the organometallic chemistry of these relatively unexplored metals. In addition, undergraduate and graduate students involved in the work will learn valuable skills in synthesis, characterization and catalysis by studying these reactive species.</AbstractNarration>
