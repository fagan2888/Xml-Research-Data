    <AbstractNarration>Online computation involves optimization problems for which the input is&lt;br/&gt;revealed progressively. Online algorithms base their decisions only on the&lt;br/&gt;past without knowledge of the future, much in the same way that a stock&lt;br/&gt;market investor or a robot that explores an unknown environment decide&lt;br/&gt;about their next action. Naturally such problems of decision-making with&lt;br/&gt;incomplete information arise in many areas. During the last decade&lt;br/&gt;research in the area of online algorithms has been very intensive. Still,&lt;br/&gt;some of the fundamental problems remain unresolved and important problems&lt;br/&gt;arise from new applications. The project deals both with old and new&lt;br/&gt;online problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the most important fundamental unsolved problem is the k-server&lt;br/&gt;problem. The objective is to settle the k-server conjecture and to&lt;br/&gt;investigate other variants of the problem such as the k-taxicab problem&lt;br/&gt;and the CNN problem. Another objective is to design and analyze&lt;br/&gt;competitive algorithms for a related problem, the online matching problem&lt;br/&gt;on Euclidean spaces; some interesting variants of the problem seem to play&lt;br/&gt;a central role in new e-commerce applications. For all these and many&lt;br/&gt;other problems, one algorithm, the generalized Work Function Algorithm,&lt;br/&gt;seems to have almost optimal competitive ratio. The research addresses the&lt;br/&gt;roots of this phenomenon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research deals also with the pertinent problem of indexing of databases;&lt;br/&gt;the size of datasets of real applications has been increasing dramatically&lt;br/&gt;and so does the importance of good indexing schemes. Competitive analysis&lt;br/&gt;can be used to quantify how much the performance of indexing schemes is&lt;br/&gt;affected by changes in a database. Finally, the techniques of competitive&lt;br/&gt;analysis are a useful tool to address specific game-theoretic problems in&lt;br/&gt;networks.</AbstractNarration>
