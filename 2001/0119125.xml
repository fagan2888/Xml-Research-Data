    <AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the Stig Lundquist Research Conference: "The Advancing Frontiers of Condensed Matter Physics". The Conference will be held in Trieste, Italy, July 2-6, 2001, under the sponsorship of the Abdus Salam International Centre of Theoretical Physics (ICTP. The theme of the Conference is Non-Conventional Systems and New Directions". Funds will be used to support the travel and local expenses of advanced graduate students, postdocs and young faculty from the United States. Core support for the Conference will be provided by the ICTP, with additional support provided by the Office of Naval Research. An excellent agenda and speaker list will address major developments taking place in "hard" and "soft" condensed matter physics, and the interface between physics and biology.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support for the travel and local expenses of advanced graduate students, postdocs and young faculty from the United States to attend an international Conference in Trieste, Italy, July 2-6, 2001. The Conference deals with the frontiers of condensed matter physics, and will address traditional areas of solid state physics, such as superconductivity, as well as areas of soft condensed matter, like colloids, polymers, rheology, etc. These topics relate to biological materials such as bone minerals (hard materials) and tissue (soft materials). Thus the interface between physics and biology will also be addressed during the conference.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
