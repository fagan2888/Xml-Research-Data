    <AbstractNarration>This grant is the result of a proposal submitted to the Information Technology Research (ITR) Initiative. The grant supports a Center for Modeling of Quantum Dynamics, Relaxation and Decoherence in Solid State Physics for Information Technology Applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical research center will investigate solid state implementation of coherent, controlled quantum dynamics in support of the recently established experimental efforts in quantum information processing. The initial research focus of the center will be on the theoretical study of few- and multi-qubit systems where the medium for the qubit interaction, relaxation, and decoherence is a semiconductor heterostructure containing a two-dimensional electron gas. For quantum computing applications, the latter is frequently considered at low temperature and high magnetic fields, corresponding to the conditions of the quantum Hall effect. This project includes exploration of the main research topics of relevance to quantum computing in the solid state, for instance, transport associated with single-quantum (single-spin) measurement ideas, or effects of gates on qubit interaction control, relaxation and decoherence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owing to the emergence of several large-scale experimental efforts in implementing quantum coherent devices for computation, the center will respond to the growing need for research into promising directions of the design of such devices. The theory center will provide an added fundamental and overarching approach complementing goal-oriented experimental efforts. The center will provide research in the application of many-body physics techniques to the analysis of quantum information systems, including relaxation, decoherence, measurement, and quantum transport features; education of the next generation of scientists who will be concerned with the implementation and application of quantum computers; formation of the scientific network in this emerging field of solid state physics by means of publications, conferences, seminars and exchange visits. Members of this interdisciplinary center include those with backgrounds in mathematics and computer science, electrical and computer engineering, materials science and physics.&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
