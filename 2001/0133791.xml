    <AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;With the virtual completion of the human DNA sequence&lt;br/&gt; research attention has shifted to issues including the resolution of the&lt;br/&gt; genetic composition, evolutionary history, and health impact of portions&lt;br/&gt; of the human genome which have proven difficult&lt;br/&gt; to sequence due to their duplicative and dynamic nature.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research aims to address these problems through&lt;br/&gt; the development of algorithms and software tools for&lt;br/&gt; discovery, resolution and evolutionary analysis of genomic&lt;br/&gt; duplications and other genome-wide segmental&lt;br/&gt; rearrangements.&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate goal is to help understand mechanisms for&lt;br/&gt; and the sources of genetic disposition to&lt;br/&gt; genome-wide structural rearrangements.&lt;br/&gt;Some of these structural rearrangements are known to cause dosage&lt;br/&gt;imbalance&lt;br/&gt; of developmentally important genes during recombination events; as a&lt;br/&gt; result, genomic diseases, including several birth defects as well as&lt;br/&gt; a number of adult diseases occur at a rate of $\~1$ in every $1000$&lt;br/&gt;births.&lt;br/&gt;The premise of this research is that understanding the mechanisms&lt;br/&gt; under such segmental rearrangements may help improve methods&lt;br/&gt; for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these genetic disorders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The basic research components of the proposal&lt;br/&gt; are (1) identification of all chromosomal segments that are&lt;br/&gt; duplicated along the genome,&lt;br/&gt; (2) understanding the complex evolutionary relationships between&lt;br/&gt; these interesting segments through novel phylogenetic analysis&lt;br/&gt; algorithms for a single genome sequence, and&lt;br/&gt; (3) identification of the duplication&lt;br/&gt; order via known or derived properties of duplication mechanisms, and&lt;br/&gt; (4) development of similarity measures between genome sequences&lt;br/&gt; that involve not only point mutations but structural rearrangements,&lt;br/&gt; particularly duplications.&lt;br/&gt;The short-term education goal of the proposal is to establish the&lt;br/&gt; algorithmic and the fundamental software development component of&lt;br/&gt; an interdisciplinary bioinformatics program at CWRU, that will provide&lt;br/&gt;means&lt;br/&gt; of awarding M.S. and Ph.D. degrees within existing departmental&lt;br/&gt; degree-granting programs.&lt;br/&gt;The long-term goal is to establish a free-standing&lt;br/&gt; graduate program in computational genomics,&lt;br/&gt; offering a wide-range of introductory and advanced level courses in&lt;br/&gt; bioinformatics.&lt;br/&gt;To this end the investigator has developed and taught a new&lt;br/&gt; introductory graduate course on algorithmic issues in bioinformatics,&lt;br/&gt; with the involvement of students from both the Computer Science&lt;br/&gt; program and the School of Medicine at CWRU.&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this proposal will be used to enhance this activity&lt;br/&gt; through the development of a new advanced level graduate course&lt;br/&gt; in computational genomics for in-depth training on&lt;br/&gt; individualized research topics, as well as an intensive summer research&lt;br/&gt; and training program for graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
