    <AbstractNarration>0125122 &lt;br/&gt;Kalonji &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to the University of Washington to support the activity described below for 36 months. The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF 0179).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partners&lt;br/&gt;The partners for the award include the University of Washington (Lead Institution), Washington State Office of Economic Development, Washington State China Relations Council, Northwest Environmental Business Council, Earth Tech, Inc., and Hart Crowser, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Activities&lt;br/&gt;The proposed effort has the following goals: (1) create new team-based approaches for faculty, students, government and industry partners to collaborate on international research and education, (2) translate the work of these teams into products, systems, and services, (3) produce a scientific and engineering workforce to work in an international marketplace. Teams of faculty and students from the University of Washington and Sichuan University in Chengdu, China will be working collaboratively on water resource management, waste water treatment, forest ecology, environmentally-friendly materials processing, biodiversity, and the impact of humans on the ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed Innovation&lt;br/&gt;The focus of the project is on building sustainable relationships for research-education-economic development. Innovation outcomes include creation of a workforce to participate in the emerging Chinese market, creation of the opportunities for small businesses to participate in academic research and to gain access to new international business opportunities, increase trade with China for Washington, and "internationalization" of some of the faculty at the University of Washington.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Economic Impact&lt;br/&gt;The major economic impact will be the expanded opportunities for Washington State business with markets in China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Societal Impact&lt;br/&gt;The Pacific Rim could be a very large market for the United States over the foreseeable future. Preparation of a workforce to participate in this market is vital to the citizens of the US in general and especially the West Coast. Asians have already trained a workforce, and the US is behind. This effort will provide the workforce to open trade for small business in China.</AbstractNarration>
