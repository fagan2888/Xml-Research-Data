    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on development of unique ceramic/polyimide nanocomposite materials. It will demonstrate the ability to formulate a polyimide (or other polymer material) with a designed coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) through the covalent incorporation of ceramic nanophase materials. The key tasks involve (1) sol-gel synthesis of ceramic nanospheres possessing a negative CTE (2) covalently bonding them into the backbone of the&lt;br/&gt;polyimide through the use of bi-functional linker molecules and (3) evaluation of various doping levels of the ceramic nanospheres to determine optimum impact on the CTE of the composite material. &lt;br/&gt; In terms of commercial uses, polyimides have wide application as films in&lt;br/&gt;the electronics, aerospace, and manufacturing industries where they are used for flexible&lt;br/&gt;circuitry, insulation materials, speaker cones, automotive switches, disk drives, and in&lt;br/&gt;many other applications. A common problem in the design of these systems using polyimides is the inherently high CTE of these materials and to a certain extent poor thermal dimensional stability. The proposed effort seeks to provide an approach to resolve these issues.</AbstractNarration>
