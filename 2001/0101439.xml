    <AbstractNarration>DMS Award Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Award #: 0101439&lt;br/&gt;PI: Kohn, Robert&lt;br/&gt;Institution: New York University &lt;br/&gt;Program: Applied Mathematics &lt;br/&gt;Program Manager: Catherine Mavriplis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Focused Research Group: Analysis and Simulation of Magnetic Devices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanoscale magnetic devices are of critical technological importance. This project will advance our understanding of their properties through a coordinated program of modeling, analysis, simulation and experiment. Topics to be addressed include (a) development of improved numerical methods for the simulation of magnetic materials and devices; (b) exploration of the micromagnetic "energy landscape" and the role of noise in thermally activated switching; and (c) investigation of specific nanoscale effects such as configurational anisotropy and geometrically constrained walls. Mathematics has much to contribute and much to gain. The study of appropriate limits leads to challenging problems of analysis whose solution will shed light on the essential physics. The analysis of noise and switching leads to the study of the energy landscape and to physically relevant examples of stochastic partial differential equations. Modeling coordinated with laboratory experiments will refine our understanding of the relevant phenomena. This Focused Research Group activity will draw expertise from a multidisciplinary group of mathematicians, physicists and computational scientists. The project includes a collaboration with IBM and training of postdoctoral scientists and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic storage devices lie at the foundation of modern computing. Their modeling, simulation, analysis and design raise fundamental questions of physics and mathematics, many still unanswered. As device size decreases, the relevant science changes: defects, spatial disorder and thermal fluctuations become crucial in the nanoscale regime. Mathematics has much to contribute and much to gain. The study of appropriate limits leads to challenging problems of analysis whose solution will shed light on the essential physics. The analysis of noise and switching will be studied in a three-pronged approach: by mathematical analysis, numerical modeling and experimental investigation. Modeling coordinated with laboratory experiments will refine our understanding of the relevant phenomena. This Focused Research Group activity will draw expertise from a multidisciplinary group of mathematicians, physicists and computational scientists. The project includes a collaboration with IBM and training of postdoctoral scientists and graduate students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Date: June 26, 2001</AbstractNarration>
