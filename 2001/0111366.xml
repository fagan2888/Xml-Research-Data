    <AbstractNarration>Using an ultrastable low temperature scanning tunneling microscope, Professor Paul S. Weiss of Pennsylvania State University is examining the effects of local chemical environment on the chemistry of adsorbed molecules. With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Weiss's group is imaging and analyzing spatially dependent perturbations of the surface electronic structure at adsorbates and surface defects. Using the ability to characterize and control defects in monolayer films, selected molecules are inserted into these defects in order to probe the chemistry of these species in this local environment. Single molecule vibrational spectroscopy of the adsorbed molecule is carried out as well, using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The detailed interactions of adsorbed molecules can be examined using scanning probe microscopy and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. Professor Weiss and his group at the Pennsylvania State University are using these methods to examine the effect of the local chemical environment on the chemistry of adsorbed molecules. This information is useful for the fundamental insights it provides for a number of important technologies, including molecular electronic devices, micro-sensors, and heterogeneous catalysis.</AbstractNarration>
