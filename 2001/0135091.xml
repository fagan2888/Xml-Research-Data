    <AbstractNarration>Professor Jennifer Shepherd, of the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga University, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for her research that involves the elucidation of rhodoquinone (RQ) biosynthesis in the purple non-sulfur bacteria, Rhodospirillum rubrum and later in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. RQ is an essential electron carrier in the anaerobic energy metabolism of both of these species as well as in the helminth parasites. Parasitic infections pose a serious health threat to both humans and domestic animals. There are few effective anthelminthic agents available due to the emergence resistant parasite strains. The Pl plans to develop new anthelminthic agents that selectively target RQ biosynthesis in parasites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teaching portion of this proposal focuses utilizing undergraduates and postdoctoral students in teaching and research. Therefore, with the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Jennifer Shepherd, of the Department of Chemistry at Gonzaga will use small projects within the specific aims of the research project to train undergraduates and larger scope projects for post doctoral associates.</AbstractNarration>
