    <AbstractNarration>The REU program at the University on Michigan provides ten selected undergraduate students from around the United States and ten students from the University of Michigan the opportunity to participate for ten weeks during the summer in research in the fields of astrophysics, atomic, molecular, and optical physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics and high energy physics. Special emphasis is placed on recruiting promising students from small liberal arts colleges and historically black institutions that cannot provide this range of research opportunities. The research experience is complemented by a wide range of educational and social activities, helping the students to put their work in a wider perspective and building a network of professional contacts for a future career in physics. The program is continuously evaluated through a number of short- and long-term measures, ensuring continued success in training the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>
