    <AbstractNarration>0101022&lt;br/&gt;Constantin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Theoretical interest and experimental efforts concerning Lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;particle analysis have been increasing in the last years. The proposed &lt;br/&gt;research is to develop an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach initiated very &lt;br/&gt;recently. A main object of study in this approach is a diffusive Lagrangian &lt;br/&gt;path inverse that allows a natural formulation, including a viscous &lt;br/&gt;analogue of the inviscid Cauchy formula. The solution is built using a &lt;br/&gt;product expansion near the identity transformation. It is proposed to study &lt;br/&gt;this construction and apply it to randomly forced flows. In addition, the &lt;br/&gt;study of quenching of flames by strong random flows in turbulent &lt;br/&gt;combustion is proposed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluids and plasmas exhibit many active scales of motion, and are &lt;br/&gt;notoriously difficult to compute and predict accurately. The reason is that &lt;br/&gt;the equations describing them are not well understood. It is proposed to &lt;br/&gt;study mathematically the processes of transport of momentum and heat &lt;br/&gt;under extreme conditions</AbstractNarration>
