    <AbstractNarration>Dillon&lt;br/&gt;0109957&lt;br/&gt; The principal investigator and his colleagues develop&lt;br/&gt;mathematical models and computational methods for analyzing the&lt;br/&gt;motion of eucaryotic cilia and flagella, the growth and&lt;br/&gt;development of the vertebrate limb bud and tumor growth. The&lt;br/&gt;objective of the cilia modeling is to develop three-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;models for an individual cilium or flagellum and for&lt;br/&gt;three-dimensional arrays of cilia. These models incorporate&lt;br/&gt;discrete representations of the axoneme's ultrastructure&lt;br/&gt;including the individual dyneins and microtubules, as well as a&lt;br/&gt;continuous description of the fluid mechanics using the immersed&lt;br/&gt;boundary method. Vertebrate limb development is a widely-used&lt;br/&gt;model system for the study of development. The investigator and&lt;br/&gt;his collaborators have developed a 2D model for vertebrate limb&lt;br/&gt;development that describes limb bud outgrowth and predicts the&lt;br/&gt;spatio-temporal distribution of growth factors and morphogens.&lt;br/&gt;The major goals of the limb development modeling are to further&lt;br/&gt;validate the 2D model, to extend it to three dimensions in order&lt;br/&gt;to determine what signals cells see as a function of their&lt;br/&gt;position in the three-dimensional limb bud and developmental&lt;br/&gt;history and, from this, to suggest how the signals can be&lt;br/&gt;integrated by cells to produce the observed spatial patterning.&lt;br/&gt;Limb development and tumor growth are moving boundary problems&lt;br/&gt;that involve tissue growth, the transport of growth factors and&lt;br/&gt;control of gene activity. The investigators are developing an&lt;br/&gt;immersed boundary model for tumor growth along with the limb&lt;br/&gt;development model.&lt;br/&gt; These mathematical models focus on the complex biological&lt;br/&gt;systems involved in cell motility, vertebrate development, and&lt;br/&gt;tumor growth. An important aspect is the development of&lt;br/&gt;computational tools for the study of these processes. Thus, the&lt;br/&gt;ciliary model is used for the computational study of dynein&lt;br/&gt;activation mechanisms in cilia and flagella and the multiciliary&lt;br/&gt;model for the study of mucociliary interaction. The vertebrate&lt;br/&gt;limb development model may be used as an aid in interpreting&lt;br/&gt;experimental results, to help identify new experiments, and to&lt;br/&gt;test hypotheses that may be difficult to test experimentally.&lt;br/&gt;Because each of the models described in this proposal includes a&lt;br/&gt;fluid-mechanical representation, there is a unifying element in&lt;br/&gt;their mathematical description. The computational methods are&lt;br/&gt;based in part on the immersed boundary method, and the computer&lt;br/&gt;codes share many of the major subroutines. An important aspect of&lt;br/&gt;this proposal is the development of parallel numerical methods&lt;br/&gt;for the solution of these problems; advances in this area can be&lt;br/&gt;used in a variety of problems in the field of computational&lt;br/&gt;biofluids.</AbstractNarration>
