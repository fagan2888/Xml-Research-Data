    <AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for equipment upgrades for the Econometrics Laboratory (EML) at the University of California, Berkeley, including a 660GB fiber channel disk tray for its fileserver, and a five-unit tape library for backups. The disk tray will increase the storage capacity of the EML, and provides larger, faster disks for improved I/O as well as RAID performance and fail-safe capability. The new removable media technology will remain synchronized with the new disk technology.&lt;br/&gt; The EML provides a state-of-the-art computational environment for economic research, particularly in compute-intensive methods and the analysis of very large datasets. Extending its disk storage and backup capabilities provides key resources that are urgently needed by applied econometrics faculty investigators and graduate dissertation students.</AbstractNarration>
