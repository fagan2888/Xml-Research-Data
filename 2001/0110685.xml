    <AbstractNarration>This award, made to the University of Utah in support of Professor Joel Miller's research is supported by the Advanced Materials Program in the Chemistry Division. The research deals with the design, synthesis, characterization and properties of metalloporphyrin-based magnetic materials.The broad goals of the research are to understand the fundamental science that governs behavior in organic-based magnets, to identify new magnetic phenomena, and to to make organic-based magnets with enhanced and controllable critical temperatures and coercive fields. The research will elucidate structure-function relationships in the one dimensional manganeseporphyrin-tetracyanoethylene system including the role of the metal atoms, the pressure dependence, the photomagnetic response and the role of spins on the periphery of the porphyrin ligand. The one dimensional systems will be extended to two and three dimensions by covalent bonding and by supramolecular hydrogen bonded manganotetraphenylporphyrins. New types of magnets will be prepared based on new classes of radical-ion acceptors capable of binding two manganese moieties. A feature of the research will be extensive collaborations with experts for structural and performance measurements and for computational modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide a fundamental understanding of magnetic behavior in molecular and supramolecular organic magnets as well as provide more temperature-stable, higher field magnets. Soluble molecular magnets will advance thin film magneto-optical applications. Collaborations with international chemists and physicists will provide strong interdisciplinary training for students.</AbstractNarration>
