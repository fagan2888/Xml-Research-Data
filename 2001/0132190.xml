    <AbstractNarration>This NSF CAREER award supports the integration of scientific research and education within the context of developing a deeper understanding of climate processes. The research objective is to improve our understanding of large-scale climate variability in the Southern Hemisphere in the context of the Southern Hemisphere "annular oscillation" (AO), a robust feature of the atmosphere's general circulation that accounts for a substantial amount of climate variance. The education activities are the following: the development of new curriculum and mentoring of graduate students. This research is important because the AO, a natural mode of the atmosphere, has been shown to have a large influence on weather and climate; however, the basic processes that control its development and characteristics are poorly understood and controversial.</AbstractNarration>
