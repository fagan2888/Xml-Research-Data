    <AbstractNarration>EIA-0130059&lt;br/&gt;Animesh Ray&lt;br/&gt;Keck Graduate Institute&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title: Causes of Robustness and Vulnerability in Real-world Networks: Lessons from molecular biology&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vulnerability of natural networks (such as the Internet, power supply grid, or molecular regulatory circuits of cells) to perturbations is an important area of study. Prior work has traditionally involved observations on static networks or on computer simulations, and has revealed certain general fundamental properties. Specifically, the study of one representative natural network by direct experimental manipulation should illuminate general properties of most networks. The molecular machinery regulating the synthesis of RNA molecules in the nucleus of budding yeast forms a natural network that can be experimentally perturbed, and their effects studied by transcriptional profiling on DNA microarrays. In this initial funding period, study of the responses of a sub-section (comprised of approximately 300 nodes) of this natural network as a function of precise perturbations in the form of gene knockout mutations. A queriable, static, database model of the network is being made, which is queried by simple attack plans, and responses are tested for consistency with experimental results. This interplay is allowing a proof-of-principle demonstration of this empirical approach to studying properties of complex networks. Insights obtained from these studies is forming the basis of more sophisticated investigation of complex network properties.</AbstractNarration>
