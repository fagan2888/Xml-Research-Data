    <AbstractNarration>Existing genefinders use information about splice sites and differences&lt;br/&gt;between exons and introns, but do not explicitly incorporate information&lt;br/&gt;about sequences known as splicing enhancers, which promote incorporation&lt;br/&gt;of exons into mRNA. This is a project to characterize exonic splicing&lt;br/&gt;enhancers in Arabidopsis. Although splicing enhancers likely function in&lt;br/&gt;splice site selection in many plant genes, and contribute to the&lt;br/&gt;regulation of alternative splicing, plant splicing enhancers have not&lt;br/&gt;yet been described in detail. Computational analysis of a database of&lt;br/&gt;Arabidopsis exons and introns will be used to identify candidate&lt;br/&gt;splicing enhancer sequences. The role of these sequences, and sequences&lt;br/&gt;from genes that are known to be alternatively spliced, will be tested in&lt;br/&gt;transgenic Arabidopsis using a splicing reporter construct. The activity&lt;br/&gt;of these enhancers will be examined in transgenes that depend on exon&lt;br/&gt;inclusion for expression. This will include analysis of the&lt;br/&gt;tissue-specificity of splicing enhancer activity and should provide an&lt;br/&gt;extensive database of information about the role of particular sequences&lt;br/&gt;in promoting splicing. This project will generate: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) 2,000 publicly available transgenic lines, available through the&lt;br/&gt;ABRC, carrying splicing reporter genes with defined candidate splicing&lt;br/&gt;enhancer sequences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2) A description of marker gene expression for each splicing enhancer&lt;br/&gt;candidate. This will consist of a description of all expression patterns&lt;br/&gt;and images of typical and selected patterns, available through the&lt;br/&gt;internet (http://www.tigr.org/2010-splicing/) and linked to the seed stocks&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3) Improved genefinding and gene annotation available as improvements to&lt;br/&gt;the existing GlimmerM server (http://www.tigr.org/softlab/glimmerm/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective use of the complete nucleotide sequence of Arabidopsis&lt;br/&gt;requires improved gene annotation. Information about the messenger RNA&lt;br/&gt;products of genes is incomplete. This project will provide to the&lt;br/&gt;scientific community both experimental data on splicing enhancers that&lt;br/&gt;will improve gene annotation, and genetic material for further study.</AbstractNarration>
