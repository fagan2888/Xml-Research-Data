    <AbstractNarration>0104649&lt;br/&gt;Phadke&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Arun Phadke and Virgilio Centano of Virginia Polytechnic and State U. in a collaboration with Hans Ottosson of Enersearch AB in Malmo, Sweden. The research will focus on catastrophic failure of power networks, exploration of methods for damage assessment, control, and restoration of electric power grids following catastrophic disturbances. Disturbances to be studied include natural disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes, and man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks and human error. The Virginia Tech group will concentrate on information system infrastructure overview, computer networks, and electric power networks for robustness in the face of catastrophic events. The Swedish group will make substantial contributions in each area, and will be able to offer ways to enhance infrastructures for improved performance. Catastrophic failures of power networks are a universal phenomenon, and restoration of service to lost loads occupies the interest of engineers throughout the world. In particular, there is a significant pool of knowledge on these topics in Northern Europe, which this collaboration will</AbstractNarration>
