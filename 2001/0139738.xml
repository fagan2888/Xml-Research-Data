    <AbstractNarration>Several aspects of theories with extra spatial dimensions will be studied. The main focus will be understanding what the resulting observable consequences for particle and gravitational physics of such models could be, that is understanding the phenomenology of such models. Secondly, the cosmological evolution and the fundamental theory of these models will also be investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Models with extra dimensions have shown new avenues to resolve some of the most fundamental problems in particle physics. These include possible explanations for why gravitational interactions are so much weaker than other particle interactions (like electromagnetism), and perhaps even new directions toward understanding the cosmological constant problem pointed out by Einstein. Due to the potential applications of these models it is very important to study them and to find out which of these could describe our Universe. This is the main goal of this project.</AbstractNarration>
