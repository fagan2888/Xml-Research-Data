    <AbstractNarration>Professor Mark E. Welker in the Department of Chemistry at Wake Forest University is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies on the development of exo-selective and/or enantioselective Diels-Alder reactions that are catalyzed by transition metals. Series of chiral ligands, transition metals, and reducing agents that do not react or react very slowing with the dienophile carbonyl and double bonds will be screened for their efficacy in the catalytic cycle. This methodology will be used to synthesize several cis-decalin ring systems related to biologically significant compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Program, Professor Welker is investigating new ways to form six-membered rings with precise control over the three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the substituents. These reactions will be catalyzed by small amounts of transition metals. By using catalytic amounts, savings in terms of material and waste disposal costs will be realized. The new methodology also will be utilized to prepare the bicyclic core structures of several biologically active organic compounds.</AbstractNarration>
