    <AbstractNarration>Abstract of OCE-0118101; "Physical and Chemical constraints on fluxes at LExEn and proposed ODP sites in the Gulf of Mexico"&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will focus on unraveling the dynamics of the gas hydrate reservoir at and between moderate and high flux sites. Through 1.) direct measurement of fluid flux with osmotic flux meters, 2) acquisition of high resolution heat flow data, 3) use of porewater and solid-phase proxies for gas flux and 4) imaging of flux conduits with high-resolution, deep-tow Chirp profiles, the study will constrain spatial and temporal variations in fluxes critical to the formation and long-term stability of gas hydrates. The results provide a test of the hypothesis that quantifiable spatial variations in energy, fluid and gas flux are related to observable changes in the distribution of free gas and gas hydrate. The study sites coincide with two sites chosen for focused microbiological research as part of an NSF funded Life in Extreme Environments project. The study sites also coincide with two sites proposed for Gulf of Mexico gas hydrates drilling and the project will provide additional site survey data for the proposed drilling.</AbstractNarration>
