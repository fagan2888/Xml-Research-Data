    <AbstractNarration>The RECOMB conference series is an annual conference, now in its fifth year, which meets at various cities around the world. The subject area, computational biology and bioinformatics, is rapidly growing in scientific importance and impact. The conference organizers are committed to supporting travel to the conference of people at the beginning of their careers, especially Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows. The support for student travel expenses will result in exposing new workers in the area to the newest, best research.</AbstractNarration>
