    <AbstractNarration>RUI: Oriented Matroids and Rigidity Theory Techniques for Pseudo&lt;br/&gt;Triangulations, Visibility Graphs and Other Structures in Computational&lt;br/&gt;Geometry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ileana Streinu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is motivated by fundamental questions in Robotics and&lt;br/&gt;Computer Graphics, such as planning the motion of a robot arm, detecting&lt;br/&gt;collisions and computing visibilities. It seeks efficient algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;solutions by investigating the underlying computational structures with&lt;br/&gt;novel mathematical tools and it has a substantial potential to lead to&lt;br/&gt;applications in understanding the nature of the protein folding process in&lt;br/&gt;biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator is undertaking a systematic plan of research aimed at&lt;br/&gt;furthering the understanding of how the underlying oriented matroid&lt;br/&gt;structure of points and lines affects properties of a variety of partially&lt;br/&gt;embedded combinatorial structures such as pseudo triangulations and&lt;br/&gt;visibility graphs. The focus is on combinatorial (enumeration, generation,&lt;br/&gt;characterization) and algorithmic questions, the underlying framework is&lt;br/&gt;geometric (dimensions 2 and 3), and the techniques involved come from&lt;br/&gt;matroid and oriented matroid theory, rigidity theory, combinatorial&lt;br/&gt;topology, computational algebraic geometry and graph embeddings.</AbstractNarration>
