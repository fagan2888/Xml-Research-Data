    <AbstractNarration>Stigma is an example of a culturally and socially determined behavior that has enormous impact on the health of individuals and populations worldwide. It is time for a major behavioral and social science approach to complement the legal approach and moral reproach that have characterized the global response to stigma regarding persons with marginalizing illnesses, such as schizophrenia , epilepsy and HIV/AIDS. This award is in support of an international conference that will take place over two and a half days in September, 2001. The conference is hosted by the Fogarty International Center at the NIH. Sessions will focus on cross cutting, socio-cultural issues including policy. It will also include sessions on population genetics and stigma.</AbstractNarration>
