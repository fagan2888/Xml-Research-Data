    <AbstractNarration>Engineering -- Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project integrates medical-imaging research and new technologies into the undergraduate biomedical engineering curriculum. It develops a series of courses and a new software package that provides dynamic simulations of commonly used medical imaging systems. As a prototype, the PI is developing a CT simulator that includes web pages illustrating principles and devices along with a Java package allowing the users to view the results as an image is processed step-by-step. Using this material, the PI is establishing a web-based medical imaging laboratory/library accessible through the Internet. The assessment process involves an evaluation of the plans by faculty colleagues, teaching evaluations and exit interviews with graduating students, and an evaluation by an external review committee and employers' feedback. In addition to establishing the web-based laboratory/library, the PI plans to present papers at the ASEE and the IEEE EMBS meetings to disseminate his work.</AbstractNarration>
