    <AbstractNarration>While both plant ecophysiology and animal ecophysiology have enjoyed strong growth over the past decades, the fields have developed differently, accompanied by an increasing gap between plant and animal ecophysiology. Plant physiological ecology has increasingly developed links to ecosystem science by scaling up physiological process, whereas animal ecophysiologists have developed more strongly in the realm of evolutionary physiology. Despite this, both communities study fundamentally similar ecophysiological processes. Researchers and professional society members in the Ecological Society of America (one of the principal societies for plant ecophysiology) and in Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (the principal society for animal ecophysiology), recognize the problem. They also recognize the gains to both fields that will accrue from increased sharing of both methods and foci.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium focuses on commonalities and differences in plant, animal, and microbial ecophysiology, exploring the benefits of increased cross-talk among different communities of researchers. It will be held at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in Madison, WI, in August 2001. In addition to reaching participants at this large, widely attended meeting, results from the symposium will be published in the journal, BioScience.</AbstractNarration>
