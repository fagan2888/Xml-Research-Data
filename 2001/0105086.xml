    <AbstractNarration>DISSERTATION RESEARCH: Examining genetic similarity, mating behavior and fitness consequences in a simultaneous hermaphrodite&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Andrew Sih&lt;br/&gt;Thomas M. McCarthy&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genetic similarity may play an important role in both mate choice and reproductive success, but few studies integrate these inter-related fields. Physid snails are simultaneous hermaphrodites that can both self-fertilize and outcross, and are thus an excellent system for addressing questions about the role of genetic similarity in mating behavior, mate choice and reproductive fitness. This study includes a series of experiments that integrates these issues. It will also consider additional factors that may affect the interplay between genetic similarity, behavior and fitness.&lt;br/&gt;The study will be comprised of three experimental sections. The first section tests for any effects of genetic similarity on mating behavior in paired snails, and for effects of genetic similarity on reproductive output and offspring hatching rate. These reproductive consequences will also be examined for self-fertilizing individuals. The second section of the study tests whether the genetic similarity of potential mates affects mate-choice decisions in groups of three individuals. The behaviors and reproductive consequences observed in the first section of the study will be used to make a priori predictions about mating frequencies during these interactions. The third section tests whether additional factors (predation risk, food availability, temperature regime and reproductive status) affect mating interactions and measures of reproductive fitness within pairs of snails with varying levels of genetic similarity.</AbstractNarration>
