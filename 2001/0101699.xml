    <AbstractNarration>This project is delivering a baccalaureate degree in Information Systems Technology (IST) to associate degree graduates at a distance within the state of Florida. This involves the collaboration of a university, community colleges, and industry. This partnership is developing, implementing, and evaluating a model distance education program that enables students to make a successful transition from an associate degree program to the IST degree Bachelor of Science. The IST option is becoming an integral part of the Engineering Technology at a Distance (ETD) program currently offered. Students from the community colleges may complete these degree programs without having to come to the University of Central Florida (UCF) campus. The initial target group of associate degree students is comprised of graduates of the Southeast Center for Networking and Information Technology Education at Daytona Beach Community College (DBCC) and Seminole Community College (SCC). Also included are Valencia Community College (VCC) students participating in their ATE funded Information Technology System and students at the College University Center at St. Petersburg Junior College. The Information Systems Technology Articulation project is giving these students the final plus 2 years for their bachelor's degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the project include developing Information Systems Technology courses for delivery at a distance and beginning to offer these courses in the 2001-2002 academic year to partners; ensuring that support services for distance learning are in place; and marketing the degree to community colleges and industries within Florida.</AbstractNarration>
