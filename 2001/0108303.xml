    <AbstractNarration>This project examines dislocations in single-crystal, single-polytype SiC and strives to establish their role in deformation and fracture. The approach is to produce fresh dislocations in SiC by deformation, investigate their morphology by TEM, and assess activation parameters of dislocation glide from yield behavior of the crystals. Emphasis is on dislocation formation, glide of partial dislocations, and relationships between mechanical and electrical properties of silicon carbide (SiC). SiC diode degradation is associated with the appearance of dark triangular shaped areas that correspond to stacking faults on parallel (0001) planes (sometimes forming 3C-SiC inclusions) similar to degradation of the early generations of laser diodes fabricated from GaAs and other III-V compound semiconductors by the occurrence of dark line defects. In these cases, recombination of electron-hole pairs is thought to provide the energy for formation of the lattice defects; in the case of SiC diodes, the recombination energy is used in the creation and motion of partial dislocations to produce stacking faults. More complete understanding of such effects requires knowledge of the activation energies for formation and glide of partial dislocations in SiC, and the efficiency of electron-hole recombination at preferred sites [e.g. kinks, anti-phase defects (APDs), or APD/vacancy complexes] on different partials. Additionally, it is planned to directly measure the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature, TBDT , in 4H- and 6H-SiC at different strain rates and compare the results with the transition temperature Tc as measured by deformation experiments. The range of temperatures for compression tests will be extended to assess whether a transition is present for deformations at higher strain rates. The research aims to relate two different transition temperatures: one in the yield stress and the other in the fracture behavior of the crystals, and to relate both to atomic level processes. &lt;br/&gt;%%% &lt;br/&gt;The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It is expected that the project will provide useful data for growth and practical applications of SiC, a material with many potential applications in high-temperature, high-frequency, high-power devices, as well as in optoelectronics. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The project is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through experiences made possible by a forefront research environment. &lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
