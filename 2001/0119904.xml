    <AbstractNarration>Through a grant from the NSF Collaboratives for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (CETP), the Virginia Collaborative for Excellence in the Preparation of Teachers has accomplished a complete redesign of the mathematics and science preparation programs for future K-8 teachers. The participating institutions (Virginia Commonwealth University, Longwood College, Mary Washington College, Norfolk State University, and regional community colleges) increased the credit hours required of future elementary school teachers from an average of 9-12 credits to an average of more than 24 and developed entirely new programs for future middle school teachers requiring substantial course work in the subjects to be taught by these teachers. In making the program modifications, the faculty completely redesigned the content and nature of instruction provided in the courses taken by future teachers. In addition, the institutions strengthened the in-school experiences provided to future teachers by preparing a cadre of outstanding current teachers to serve as Clinical Faculty in the teacher preparation programs, providing enhanced practicum, class visitation and student teaching experiences for the future teachers. Finally, a Teaching Apprentice Program was put in place at each institution to aid in the recruitment and retention of prospective teachers. A follow-on project at Virginia Commonwealth University is conducting an assessment of the classroom effectiveness of teachers prepared under the new programs. The summative evaluation is focusing on the extent to which project goals were met; the impact of the project on faculty, preservice students and participating institutions; and the effectiveness of the VCEPT teacher graduates. The project is also providing mentoring to effectively transition a group of new teachers into their profession, by assigning a Clinical Faculty Member to mentor new graduates. Virginia Commonwealth University continues as the lead institution for the follow-on proposal.</AbstractNarration>
