    <AbstractNarration>The 12th International Conference on Arabidopsis Research will be held at&lt;br/&gt;the University of Wisconsin, Madison WI, June 23 - 27, 2001. The aim of this&lt;br/&gt;conference is to provide an opportunity for the exchange of ideas among&lt;br/&gt;researchers of the international Arabidopsis research community. The&lt;br/&gt;conference will include sessions on genomics, metabolism and metabolic&lt;br/&gt;regulation, cell biology, inductive processes, genetic mechanisms,&lt;br/&gt;evolution, responses to the biotic environment, responses to the abiotic&lt;br/&gt;environment, pattern formation and cell fate, and sex and reproductive&lt;br/&gt;development. An important component of the conference is that approximately&lt;br/&gt;40 speakers will be chosen by the session chairs from submitted abstracts&lt;br/&gt;for short talks. The majority of these talks will be given by graduate&lt;br/&gt;students, postdoctoral researchers, or PIs at early stages of their careers.&lt;br/&gt; This will ensure presentation of the latest results and provide important&lt;br/&gt;career development for the selected speakers. The conference will also&lt;br/&gt;include workshops on topics put forward by the Arabidopsis community. A&lt;br/&gt;workshop to foster international collaboration on Arabidopsis functional&lt;br/&gt;genomics and the NSF-supported Arabidopsis 2010 initiative is already&lt;br/&gt;planned. Last year's Arabidopsis Conference at this same site attracted&lt;br/&gt;approximately 900 participants. At least this many participants are&lt;br/&gt;expected this year due to the accelerated pace of Arabidopsis research&lt;br/&gt;resulting in part from the completion of the genome sequence for this&lt;br/&gt;organism, and due to the small number of plant-related conferences scheduled&lt;br/&gt;for summer 2001. Facilities are available to accommodate up to 1000&lt;br/&gt;participants.</AbstractNarration>
