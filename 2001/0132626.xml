    <AbstractNarration>The Idaho EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement project invests in three research focus areas and implements a number of initiatives to strengthen statewide human resource development and train its 21st century workforce. Idaho's three research universities, the University of Idaho, Idaho State University and Boise State University will collaborate in these endeavors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Idaho research universities will build nationally competitive teams in the following areas: 1) nanoscale materrials for electronics and sensor applications; 2) life at interfaces and the biocomplexity of extreme environments; and 3) neuro-fuzzy soft computing via silicon structures. In the nanoscale materials area, research will focus on the ultimate suitability of various materials for device and sensor applications in electronics, optoelectronics and magnetics. The research in life at interfaces and the biocomplexity of extreme environments will address biochemical and geochemical aspects of life at rock-water interfaces in extreme environments through an interdisciplinary combination of field, laboratory and modeling components. Neuro-fuzzy soft computing via silicon structures will address theoretical and practical issues for developing enabling technology necessary for cost effective neuro-fuzzy computing systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The human resource development programs will add value to the project's research focus areas through the integration of research training and student education and through professional development of faculty. A number of activities are also proposed for new and continuing collaborations with national laboratories and Idaho's private sector. In addition, specific programs will address several of the issues challenging Idaho's workforce, including the recruitment and retention of members of underrepresented groups in research and education-related activities.</AbstractNarration>
