    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: 0073355&lt;br/&gt;Proposal type: Investigator Initiated for International &lt;br/&gt; Conference&lt;br/&gt;Principal investigator: Edward L. Cussler&lt;br/&gt;Affiliations: University of Minnesota/ Engineering Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical Separations: Refocusing Chemical Engineering&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports partially the participation by 30 American faculty in the Engineering Foundation Conference, "Chemical Separations: Refocusing Chemical Engineering", to be held in Barga, Italy, from May 27 to June 1, 2001. This conference is the successor to earlier conferences on chemical separations. This particular meeting will explore the changing nature of the chemical industry and the implications for chemical-engineering research and education. Case studies will be used to seek new ways of organizing the field, both in education and research, in order to meet emerging needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is provided to support partially participation by ten invited speakers and twenty junior faculty from the U.S. Both academic and industrial researchers will participate in sessions on Process Intensification, Chemical Products, and New Paradigms.</AbstractNarration>
