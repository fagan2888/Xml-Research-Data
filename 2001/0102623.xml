    <AbstractNarration>Divisions of Chemistry, and Bioengineering and Environmental Systems support this multidivisional award to University of California Los Angeles, and this award is part of the Nanoscale Exploratory Research in the Nanoscale Science and Engineering program. Under this project, Jeffrey Zink will synthesize nano-engineered photo-electrochemical cells by self assembly process using solution-based sol-gel process, which will replace time consuming step-by-step serial assembly process. This materials synthesis method will provide flexibility in the spatial configuration and the chemical environment of the photoelectron donors and acceptors. Theoretical studies will be performed to determine the charge separation and electron transport in the nanostructured materials. The research program will provide education and training opportunities in material chemistry to underrepresented groups in undergraduate education through the Student Research Participation and Center for Academic Excellence programs at University of California at Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the award, nano-engineered photo-electrochemical cells will be fabricated using a solution-based sol-gel self-assembly process. The process will yield ordered and oriented nanostructures of relatively large sizes for the development of photoelectrochemical devices. In addition, the research program will provide multidisciplinary education and training opportunities in materials chemistry to underrepresented groups in undergraduate education.</AbstractNarration>
