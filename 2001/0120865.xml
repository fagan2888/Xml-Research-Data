    <AbstractNarration>The Association for Women in Science (AWIS) will develop a guide to mentoring aimed at the Latino community, called Una Mano al Futuro. Studies demonstrate that students are more likely to pursue science if they have mentors, have opportunities to explore potential careers, and learn in a supportive environment. Una Mano al Futuro will focus on reaching high school Latino girls at a critical stage and providing resources that can be used by the young women, their parents, teachers, and community leaders to create the environment that allows the women to explore their interest in science and technology careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the past 10 years, AWIS has established and improved community mentoring programs for pre-college, undergraduate and graduate students with funding from the Sloan Foundation, NSF and the NEC Corporation. AWIS's prior projects built on the knowledge and success of the Sloan mentoring program and produced a new publication: Creating Tomorrow's Scientists: Models of Community Mentoring. AWIS will edit and&lt;br/&gt;revise their award-winning mentoring books, including A Hand Up: Women Mentoring Women in Science and Mentoring Means Future Scientists, and produce Spanish language editions with on-line companion materials in both English and Spanish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AWIS will work with several partners in developing materials and in dissemination to the Latino community: ASPIRA, a non-profit organization committed to Latino youth issues, and Minority Women in Science (MWIS). Members of AWIS, throughout its 76 local chapters, will distribute materials and assist in planning community-based events to reinforce the message of the materials.</AbstractNarration>
