    <AbstractNarration>Abstract for DMS - 0104116.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal consists of seven items. The first item is a joint&lt;br/&gt;project of the two principal investigators and returns to previous&lt;br/&gt;joint work on the wave trace for a manifold with boundary, in order to&lt;br/&gt;sharpen and simplify the earlier results by defining the wave trace,&lt;br/&gt;not as a trace on the space of initial data of the wave equation, but&lt;br/&gt;as a trace on the space of boundary data. The second item is a joint&lt;br/&gt;project of Guillemin and K. Okikiolu and involves refinements of a&lt;br/&gt;recent result on ``two-tiered'' asymptotics for Szego estimates. The&lt;br/&gt;third item is a joint project of Guillemin with C. Zara, and concerns&lt;br/&gt;the interplay between graph theory and topology on GKM manifolds. The&lt;br/&gt;fourth item is a joint project of Melrose and P. Loya extending the&lt;br/&gt;Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem to manifolds with corners. The&lt;br/&gt;fifth item involves on-going work of Melrose and R. Mazzeo and the&lt;br/&gt;beginning of a project with D. Grieser to analyze the Laplacian on&lt;br/&gt;singular algebraic varieties by blow-up and pseudodifferential&lt;br/&gt;methods. The sixth project involves Melrose, A. Hassell and A. Vasy in&lt;br/&gt;the description of scattering by potentials which are smooth up to&lt;br/&gt;infinity. The final item is a joint project of Melrose and J. Wunsch&lt;br/&gt;in which the propagation of singularities for waves on manifolds with&lt;br/&gt;conic singularities is investigated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common theme of the items above is the wave equation and related&lt;br/&gt;techniques. For instance, one of the important applications of the joint&lt;br/&gt;project of the two principal investigators will be to the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the reflection of waves in a domain in the plane. For a convex planar&lt;br/&gt;domain the results of this project should shed light on the celebrated&lt;br/&gt;problem: "Can one hear the shape of a drum", that is, do the frequencies of&lt;br/&gt;vibration of a planar domain, corresponding to the head of a drum,&lt;br/&gt;determine its shape? Earlier work of the investigators showed that these&lt;br/&gt;frequencies of vibration determine the so-called "length spectrum" of the&lt;br/&gt;domain, namely the lengths of inscribed polygons of minimal&lt;br/&gt;circumference. One result of the investigation above should be a&lt;br/&gt;determination of the SHAPES of these polygons as well.</AbstractNarration>
