    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program to Cornell University supports instrument acquisition for the National Nanofabrication User Network (NNUN). The NNUN consists of sites at Cornell, Stanford, Howard, Penn State, and Howard University, provides advanced nanofabrication resources to users from around the country. In the most recent year, NNUN served over 1500 users from fields as diverse as microelectronics, micromechanics, optics, biology, materials science, chemistry, and physics. Modern equipment is key to our ability to serve this diverse user community. This award includes funds to upgrade critical NNUN facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under this award, CNF will purchase a Laser Pattern Generator. This instrument is crucial not only for fabrication of advanced photomasks but also for direct laser fabrication at dimensions as small as a quarter of a micrometer. Howard University will install an advanced ion source to its SIMS system to increase its capability for microanalysis. Under this award, the facility at Penn State will purchase an advanced field emission SEM. When combined with an integrated scanning tunneling microscope from another award, an advanced nanoscale characterization tool will be made available to NNUN users. UCSB will purchase a new computer control system to upgrade its JBX5 electron beam lithography tool to allow it to continue to support microfabrication in the sub &lt;br/&gt;Micrometer range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Nanofabrication User Network (NNUN), consisting of sites at Cornell, Stanford, Howard, Penn State, and Howard University, provides advanced nanofabrication resources to users from around the country.

This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program includes funds to upgrade mask-making facilities at Cornell, to expand microanalysis capabilities at Penn State and Howard University, and to upgrade electron beam lithography facilities at UC Santa Barbara. This equipment is critical to enable NNUN to serve an exponentially growing number of users, faculty, students postdocs and users from industry.</AbstractNarration>
