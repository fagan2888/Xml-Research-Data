    <AbstractNarration>The Design and Manufacturing Simulation Project (DMSP) is supporting systemic reform through education, applied research, curriculum development and reform, professional development, and dissemination. It is also providing a forum for joint industry/education collaboration focused on identifying manufacturing and simulation technologies critical to the success of the automotive industry centered in the southeastern Michigan region. Curriculum work is addressing mathematics, science and technology components essential to the lean manufacturing enterprise and its virtual design and manufacturing simulation activities. Expertise is being developed by engaging subject matter experts and by providing workplace experiences for faculty, teachers and students from a variety of diverse backgrounds. The DMSP is utilizing the Wisconsin Instructional Design System (WIDS) to create educational modules designed to enhance existing manufacturing programs and develop modules that focus on industry-validated simulation competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DMSP partners include Mott, Macomb, Oakland, and Henry Ford Community Colleges, Central Michigan University, General Motors, Daimler-Chrysler, Delphi Automotive, Detroit Center Tool, Delmia, Mechanical Dynamics, and the Tech Prep consortiums of Genesee, Macomb, Oakland, St. Clair, and Wayne counties. This partnership involves the Design and Manufacturing Alliance (DMA), an established partnership between the four community colleges and several business/industry representatives focused on design and manufacturing careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DMSP is enhancing existing Design/Drafting/CAD Associate Degree programs by incorporating and using simulation to validate design scenarios. In addition, the Manufacturing Simulation Technology - Robotics program (NSF/ATE #9950052) is being modified to address the needs of the virtual machining simulation industry. Curriculum deliverables include modules that update existing design and manufacturing degrees for 21st century industry and post-Associate degree or certificate programs that address simulation competencies and software products. The goal is to supply the automotive manufacturing industry with skilled workers capable of embracing advanced design and simulation activities that support more efficient development of automobiles. The DMSP seeks to increase the number of minority and underrepresented candidates in the field and is marketing programs and opportunities to schools, businesses, and parent/professional groups.</AbstractNarration>
