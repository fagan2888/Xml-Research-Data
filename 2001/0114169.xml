    <AbstractNarration>0114169 Pavlostathis The objective of this research is the in-depth assessment of the microbial reductive transformation and decolorization potential of anthraquinone and phthalocyanine reactive dyes. Several commercial dyes as well as model compounds will be used. The target dyes will be characterized, and their redox chemistry investigated. Specific analytical techniques, which are currently lacking, will be developed for the identification and quantification of the parent dyes as well as their transformed products. The kinetics and extent of abiotic, chemical and microbial reductive transformation and decolorization of the target dyes will be assessed. Mechanistic aspects of electron transfer during the reductive decolorization of the target dyes and the use of electron mediators for the potential enhancement of the decolorization process will be investigated. To further evaluate reductive biodecolorization under more realistic conditions, the decolorization process will be evaluated using a continuous-flow, fixed-film bioreactor under saline conditions typically encountered in commercial textile reactive dyebaths. Experimental measurements in both batch and continuous-flow systems will be used to develop mathematical models for the quantitative description of the reductive biodecolorization of the target dyes, including the potential beneficial effect of electron transfer mediators. ***</AbstractNarration>
