    <AbstractNarration>Funding is provided under this RUI award to permit 8 teams of undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;students over the course of a two-year period to participate in a continuous&lt;br/&gt;research project evaluating the thermomechanical fatigue of solder joints. To&lt;br/&gt;make this experience successful it is proposed to create a unique learning&lt;br/&gt;experience which is a combination of innovative classroom instruction and&lt;br/&gt;research. A master's student will assist in this project, and by doing so have a&lt;br/&gt;unique master's level experience designed to require the evaluation of the work&lt;br/&gt;of others, the synthesis of their work with that of the undergraduates and the&lt;br/&gt;development of leadership skills. There are research and teaching components to&lt;br/&gt;this proposed project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research: Thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) is the leading cause of solder joint&lt;br/&gt;failure in electronic assemblies. TMF of solder joints is difficult to model as&lt;br/&gt;there are many complex and interacting factors effecting the progression of&lt;br/&gt;damage to the joint. Because of the high homologous temperatures (0.8 or higher)&lt;br/&gt;significant microstructural evolution occurs during TMF, changing the properties&lt;br/&gt;of the material as TMF progresses. An experimental&lt;br/&gt;investigation will be conducted to 1) identify those more readily measured material&lt;br/&gt;properties most likely to affect TMF resistance, 2) evaluate the various&lt;br/&gt;acceleration factors used in TMF testing, and 3) evaluate the role of wetting in&lt;br/&gt;TMF failures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of this research much insight into TMF failure will be gained - 1)&lt;br/&gt;progress will be made toward the development of an experimentally verified&lt;br/&gt;energy model, and 2) the role of wetting in adhesion will be assessed. This&lt;br/&gt;means that those considering using lead-free solder alloys will be able to use&lt;br/&gt;diagnostic "tools" not currently available -- the combination of material&lt;br/&gt;properties which correlate to TMF resistance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Teaching: To enable undergraduates to participate in a continuing research&lt;br/&gt;program, a unique "classroom" experience will supplement the research. These&lt;br/&gt;class sessions will embrace interactive learning techniques, and expose the&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to 1) the necessary theoretical background, 2) the status of the&lt;br/&gt;project, 3) necessary lab techniques including statistical analysis, 4) oral and&lt;br/&gt;written communication skills, and 5) broader issues including ethics and&lt;br/&gt;economic impact. All of these subjects will be context based. The philosophy of&lt;br/&gt;this course is that upper level undergraduates need to perform at the synthesis&lt;br/&gt;level of Bloom's Taxonomy, and their experience is designed to enable them to do&lt;br/&gt;so.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The master's student will be required to perform at the evaluation level of&lt;br/&gt;Bloom's Taxonomy (evaluating the work of the undergraduates) and synthesize this&lt;br/&gt;work with their own study on wetting, thus participating in a unique integrating&lt;br/&gt;experience. Additionally the student will develop leadership skills, and&lt;br/&gt;possibly be persuaded to pursue a doctoral degree and develop a desire to teach.&lt;br/&gt;The master's students experience may also encourage the undergraduates to pursue&lt;br/&gt;a graduate degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is felt that this comprehensive plan will maximize the chances for success&lt;br/&gt;and serve as a demonstration project for others desiring to incorporate research&lt;br/&gt;into the undergraduate experience and developing a novel masters program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Impact: It is felt that this program can significantly impact undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;education by serving as a proof of concept in the development of research&lt;br/&gt;oriented courses, generating an appreciation of life-long learning, and&lt;br/&gt;demonstrating the value of undergraduate research to the outside community. This&lt;br/&gt;work complements the current work of the PI and lays the foundation for his&lt;br/&gt;future plans.</AbstractNarration>
