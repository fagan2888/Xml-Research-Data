    <AbstractNarration>This project develops a new certificate program to provide innovative training in the high demand area of web technology, including network fundamentals, client-server architectures, interactive dynamic multimedia human-computer interfaces and relevant development tools and languages. The program is unique in its coverage of the complete end-to-end web technology spectrum, from multimedia user clients to information servers. The project involves a regional collaborative partnership including a community college, four year colleges and universities, a public school district, and industries. The objectives are to develop, implement and evaluate new courses and educational materials, to develop a program web site to be shared by industry and academia, and to develop and implement "train the trainer" workshops for faculty. Undergraduate students are the primary target audience of the newly developed certificate course offerings. The project also provides professional development opportunities for college and university faculty, high school faculty and industry representatives as well as outreach to high school students.</AbstractNarration>
