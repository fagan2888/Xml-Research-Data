    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Dr. Scott Carlson at Luther College to acquire instrumentation necessary to pursue basic research related to control of blood pressure regulation. Specifically, the grant provides funding for purchase of a telemetric monitoring system, isolated tissue bath setup, doppler flow probe system, a microtome with a freeze stage, and a gamma counter. This equipment provides state-of-the-art technologies necessary for basic research related to rat cardiovascular physiology, and will be utilized by faculty and undergraduate students to pursue research projects related to cardiovascular control under normal and pathological conditions. &lt;br/&gt; Three faculty/student research projects will be supported by this grant. The first project focuses on how the rat brain receives information regarding dietary intake and normally responds to prevent alterations in blood pressure. The second study will examine the effects of diabetes on blood pressure and vascular function. The third study will investigate whether estrogen protects cognitive function, in part by maintaining proper blood flow to regions of the brains associated with learning and memory. &lt;br/&gt; The projects described above will allow the awardee and his students to pursue &lt;br/&gt;basic research which addresses significant physiological questions. The projects &lt;br/&gt;will directly involve undergraduate students, giving them experience in &lt;br/&gt;cardiovascular research methods and in the scientific process. Furthermore, students will present research at national meetings and in publication format. It is expected that the equipment will increase collaborative opportunities within the college and with other institutions through the use of the instrumentation as core equipment for the Biology Department. This instrumentation will also be integrated into the classroom curriculum, through a planned "Introduction to Cardiovascular Research" course as well as in the current physiology laboratory courses. Thus, in addition to the 6 undergraduate students which are currently working in the awardee's laboratory, it is expected that approximately 110 students will annually utilize this equipment during their course work. Finally, the instrumentation will be used in the Summer Science Program, which exposes minority students to scientific research. Thus, acquisition of this equipment will greatly benefit the educational and research goals to which Luther College and the National &lt;br/&gt;Science Foundation are committed.</AbstractNarration>
