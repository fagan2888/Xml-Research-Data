    <AbstractNarration>0132692&lt;br/&gt;Bhatia&lt;br/&gt;Under this CAREER Award, the investigator will develop a comprehensive research program in Microscale Hepatic Tissue Engineering oriented towards elucidating the structure/function relationship of the liver. The liver architecture in vivo will be used as a guide to quantitatively investigate and optimize hepatocyte-to-hepatocycte cell interactions, hepatocycte-to-non-parenchymal cell interactions, cell-to-extracellular matrix interactions, and the role of soluble cues. Micropatterned surfaces conjugated with the adhesive peptide RGD as a model extracellular matrix will be used to ligate integrins and control cell-to-cell interactions in 2D. Photopolymerized PEG hydrogels conjugated with RGD will be used to present an adhesive peptide to aggregated hepatocytes in a 3D context. Photopatterning of cell-containing hydrogels will be used to explore 3D features of tissue structure. Collectively, the studies will provide fundamental insight into the cross-talk between integrins, cadherins, and gap junctions as well as the relative role of 2D and 3D environments in this cross-talk. Insights gained will benefit design of bioartificial liver reactors and implantable constructs and should have a major technological impact on the practice of 3D tissue engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The educational plan focused on building and maintaining the involvement of women in science and engineering and the need for further integration across the fields of engineering, biology, and medicine. A pilot outreach program for 11-13 year old girls would be expanded and a study of reasons for attrition of women in engineering would be broadened. An interdisciplinary undergraduate textbook on Tissue Engineering would be completed.</AbstractNarration>
