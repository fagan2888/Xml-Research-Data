    <AbstractNarration>0107293&lt;br/&gt;Ratnayeke&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The International Research Fellow Awards Program enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct three to twenty-four months of research abroad. The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide twenty-four months of support to Dr. Shyamala Ratnayeke of Spelman College to work with Dr. Kalinga Padmalal of Open University of Sri Lanka in Nugegoda, Sri Lanka on the determinants of interspecific diversity of tropical carnivora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine questions underlying variations in animal diversity and the local processes limiting the coexistence of species within an area. The findings will have direct implications for the allocation and management of protected areas in tropical regions and contributes to an increased understanding of global patterns of biodiversity. Specifically, Dr. Ratnayeke will measure species diversity in a group of animals occupying a higher trophic level and sharing a common phylogenetic ancestry, namely the mammalian Carnivora. Species diversity in this taxon will be compared in 2 tropical habitats that show marked contracts in primary productivity. Mammalian carnivores as a group occupy the highest position in the food chain, are highly mobile, and demonstrate tremendous inter- and intraspecific variation and flexibility in behavior and ecology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Padmalal is the Head of the Environmental Studies Unite at the Open University and is currently involved in avian diversity and cervid research.</AbstractNarration>
