    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;Integrating technology and research rich laboratory experiences into biology curricula clearly fosters creativity and significantly improves learning. At Wittenberg University we strive to provide hands-on learning opportunities for our undergraduate students that are inquiry based and integrate modern scientific equipment. To accomplish this goal in an immunology course a "research-based mixed-model" approach is being adapted from the University of St. Thomas, Rider University, Haverford College and St. Mary's University. The mixed-model approach provides students with 10 weeks of instructor led exercises followed by a 4 week long directed research project. This project is providing students with a high quality investigative laboratory experience as a means of enhancing learning in immunology. The acquisition of scientific laboratory equipment and training faculty in both equipment use and integration of a research-based pedagogy into their courses is accomplishing the objectives of the project. Moreover, the Department of Biology strongly promotes undergraduate research and believes that student-centered investigative laboratory experiences fosters the creativity that leads to increased student involvement in independent research. This adaptation and implementation proposal targets the DUE themes of integration of technology in education and faculty development.</AbstractNarration>
