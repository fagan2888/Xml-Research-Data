    <AbstractNarration>The project focuses on Hamiltonian ODEs and PDEs under strong constraining&lt;br/&gt;forces. For an given Hamiltonian composed of the kinetic energy and a&lt;br/&gt;potential energy, consider particles restricted to a submanifold&lt;br/&gt;(independent of time) in the configuration space, i.e. a holonomic&lt;br/&gt;constraint. The idealization of the constrained particles' motion is&lt;br/&gt;governed by a Hamiltonian system defined on the tangent bundle of this&lt;br/&gt;submanifold involving geometric notions. In physics, an alternative way to&lt;br/&gt;realize the constraint is to consider the system in the original space&lt;br/&gt;with an extra strong potential which penalizes the distance to the&lt;br/&gt;constraining submanifold. This idea applies to both Hamiltonian ODEs and&lt;br/&gt;PDEs. While the convergence of the motions under strong constraining&lt;br/&gt;potentials to the limit geometric Hamiltonian motions on finite time&lt;br/&gt;intervals has been studied for ODEs, the problem in PDEs is basically&lt;br/&gt;untouched. The project focuses on two questions. The first is the&lt;br/&gt;convergence of the strongly penalized motions, both on finite and infinite&lt;br/&gt;time intervals. The second question is the relation between the dynamics of&lt;br/&gt;the strongly penalized motions and their limits, i.e. the structural&lt;br/&gt;stability under strong constraining forces. The subjects are stability,&lt;br/&gt;periodic motions, homoclinic motions, resonances, etc. The problem can also&lt;br/&gt;be viewed as homogenization or elliptic type singular perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of motions of particles restricted to submanifolds in the&lt;br/&gt;configuration space appears naturally in both classical mechanics and&lt;br/&gt;PDEs. For example, in classical mechanics, whenever a rigid rod is&lt;br/&gt;considered as elastic with a large elastic coefficient, the problem falls&lt;br/&gt;in this category. Also, it is found, in material science, that some&lt;br/&gt;anti-ferromagnetic systems converges to geometric wave equations&lt;br/&gt;targeted on the unit 2-dimensional sphere formally. Therefore, it is&lt;br/&gt;important to study how the constrained motions converge. Moreover, as the&lt;br/&gt;penalized motions have high frequency oscillations, it is even more&lt;br/&gt;important to investigate the relation between the asymptotic qualitative&lt;br/&gt;behaviors.</AbstractNarration>
