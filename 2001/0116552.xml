    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program will allow the University of Massachusetts to purchase a x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with integrated Auger analysis. The instrument will significantly enhance the capabilities of Interface Analysis Laboratory at UMass by providing high-resolution surface analysis and depth profiling capabilities that are currently lacking. The facility is accessible to the UMass community as well as research personnel from the surrounding Five College Community that includes Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and Hampshire Colleges and local industry. The Interface Analysis Laboratory and its director play an instrumental role in the support of broadly funded research programs in the chemical biological and materials sciences and for training of graduate and undergraduate students at these and other institutions. Specific programs include assessment of composition, contamination, interfacial properties and growth mechanisms for metal and semiconductor multi-layer films deposited from supercritical fluids, characterizing the chemical composition of polymer surfaces and interfaces modified to control interfacial interactions, surface wetting and biocompatability and the rational design of constrained-geometry catalysts for olefin polymerization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program will allow the University of Massachusetts to purchase a x-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with integrated Auger analysis. In tandem, XPS and Auger spectroscopy provide precise information regarding the atomic and molecular composition of surfaces that is crucial for the development and application of the advanced materials that are fueling today's economy. These include the assessment of metal and semiconductor films for microelectronic and photonic devices, the characterization of modified surfaces for consumer and medical applications, and the characterization of catalysts for more efficient fuel and chemical production. The instrument will be housed in an open Surface Analysis Facility that is easily accessible to the UMass Campus as well as research personnel from the surrounding Five College Community that includes Smith, Mt. Holyoke, Amherst and Hampshire Colleges and local industry. The facility plays an instrumental role in the training of graduate and undergraduate students at these and other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
