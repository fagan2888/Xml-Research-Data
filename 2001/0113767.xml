    <AbstractNarration>This project develops an information security curriculum to serve students from a broad range of backgrounds. It takes an integrated approach to information security education that covers both technological and policy issues. It includes a partnership with Clark-Atlanta University to design and development of an innovative and broad curriculum that could be used to train future information security professionals. The curriculum starts with a gateway course that provides a broad introduction to the field. This is followed by an initial set of courses, each of which focuses on a coherent body of knowledge. Each course introduces students to core concepts that cover a particular aspect of information security and includes projects that provide hands-on experience with the tools and techniques that can be used to build high assurance systems. A key component of the project is the creation and testing of teaching materials and projects for the courses. The curriculum development and its implementation is part of the development of a variety of programs in the information security area for a diverse body of students. These include an undergraduate specialization and a masters certificate and a concentration area for doctoral students. The courses that support these programs are available to students from Georgia Tech, Clark-Atlanta and other institutions that are located in the Atlanta area. This enables students to meet the critical needs for information assurance specialists in our country.</AbstractNarration>
