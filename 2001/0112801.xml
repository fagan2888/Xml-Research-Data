    <AbstractNarration>This project will develop new methods for the efficient dissemination of the data collected by wireless&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks. With recent and projected advances in small, low cost microelectronic and micro-electromechanical sensors, it is easy to envision that a large array of sensors, distributed over an&lt;br/&gt;appropriate region, will be able to measure the spatial and temporal variations of important attribute&lt;br/&gt;field such as temperature, moisture, sound, light, gas concentrations, etc.. However, to realize the&lt;br/&gt;benefits of such arrays, wireless communication networks must be devised that with low power encode&lt;br/&gt;and disseminate the large amounts of data they generate. With this as the goal, the project will&lt;br/&gt;develop new methods of distributed data compression and data dissemination for dense sensor arrays,&lt;br/&gt;that is, for arrays whose sensors are so close that their measurements are highly correlated. One thesis&lt;br/&gt;of this project is that the correlations in such arrays can be exploited in order to make the network&lt;br/&gt;operate essentially as efficiently as a sparse sensor network, while having the additional advantages of&lt;br/&gt;being resilient to sensor failures and permitting the attribute field to be measured adaptively or with&lt;br/&gt;higher spatial resolution. Another thesis is that the data compression and dissemination issues for&lt;br/&gt;such networks are deeply intertwined. Accordingly, the project focuses on the joint design of such.&lt;br/&gt;For example, it seeks methodology for tailoring distributed data compression methods to partcular&lt;br/&gt;dissemination strategies, and vice versa. In the process, it proposed to learn how the performance of&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks depends on a variety of issues such as the number and placement of sensors.</AbstractNarration>
