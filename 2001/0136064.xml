    <AbstractNarration>Rice blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea, is a major threat to food security worldwide. Decades of intense investigation have proven the fungus to be eminently suitable for genetic and molecular genetic manipulation, making it the primary model for elucidating the basis of phytopathogenesis, including infection related morphogenesis and cultivar/host range specificity. The Magnaporthe research community has established an international consortium with the goal of obtaining a complete genome sequence of the fungus. The community has also developed numerous biological resources and tools to take immediate advantage of the sequence. This project represents a partnership between North Carolina State University and the Whitehead Institute-Center for Genome Research to generate and assemble the entire genome using a whole genome shotgun approach and to perform automated annotation. The rapid availability of this sequence in an annotated form will immediately provide new opportunities for integrating research and education of students. The data will promote the discovery of genes and potential anti-fungal targets, permit reconstruction of pathways, provide sequence-anchored clone paths for use in genetic and functional studies, and enable comparative genomic approaches to commence. Moreover, the data will provide the foundation for the discovery and design of novel environmentally sound strategies to more effectively manage this and other fungal diseases. This is a Microbial Genome Sequencing Award funded through a collaborative activity between the National Science Foundation and the Department of Agriculture Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. This award represents one portion of the Magnaporthe grisea genome sequencing project. The other portion is being funded by the USDA.</AbstractNarration>
