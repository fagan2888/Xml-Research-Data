    <AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will demonstrate using a prototype design the commercial feasibility of electrospinning to produce nanofibers. Nanofibers will be combined with conventional filter media to form a novel NanoFilter media for liquid and air filtration applications. These applications have been shown to remove particles smaller than 3 microns from effluent streams with superior filtering efficiency and attractive cost potential. The acrylic nanofibers will be electrospun as a nanoweb directly on to a conventional support (filter media) substrate. The web will be combined with a protective cover layer to form a sandwich structure, which will be collected as a roll. The filter will be easily tailored to achieve the desired composite filter performance by varying architecture: substrates, nanofiber diameter, nanoweb density, and the nanoweb thickness. This project will be carried out collaboratively with academic centers and major corporations as its strategic partners. &lt;br/&gt; Nanotechnologies developed in the coming years will form the foundation for a significant commercial platform. Commercial applications in a variety of filtration processes such as: high-end industrial raw material purification, biological separations, ultra pure air and water systems, hospital clean rooms, agriculture and food industries filters, and microelectronic industries next generation clean environment needs are anticipated.</AbstractNarration>
