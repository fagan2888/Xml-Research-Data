    <AbstractNarration>Through this project, the Information Institute of Syracuse is integrating human expertise into the evolving digital library being developed through the NSDL program and is building a virtual reference desk to support the library. In particular, a research study is exploring how the integration of reference and collection building may lead to a more effective information service. The research questions shall ask when and why users seek help online, and how an NSDL virtual reference desk may be evaluated. Multiple qualitative (content analysis and "talk aloud protocols") and quantitative (web usage analysis and surveys) methods shall be used to ascertain a better understanding of the digital reference process. The project's second objective is to build an operational virtual reference desk system for the NSDL. This system will build on the extensive digital reference expertise the Information Institute of Syracuse gained through its AskERIC and Virtual Reference Desk projects. The NSDL operational system will use in-place math, science, and technology expertise as well as digital reference systems experience to build a functioning distributed virtual reference desk.</AbstractNarration>
