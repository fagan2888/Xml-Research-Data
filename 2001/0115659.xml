    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to substantially increase the emerging reading skills of young children by employing technology to enhance the effectiveness of the Success for All (SFA) reading program. The project will develop DVD, video, and computer technology to improve the SFA reading, ESL, tutoring, and professional development components, and systematically evaluate each component separately and then together in an integrated program. By carefully integrating technology in various of aspects of the SFA program, the PIs' believe it is possible to double the effect size on reading measures from .5 to 1.0 and to halve the failure rate. A new format for instruction called DaViD (DVD incorporating assessment and instruction) will integrate DVD technology with teacher instruction, incorporating material from Between the Lions, a PBS program designed to enhance children's literacy. It will incorporate additional video/DVD presentations to present vocabulary used in Reading Roots (beginning reading) lessons and to preview the content of Reading Roots stories. Additionally, a computer-assisted tutoring program, the Reading CAT, will be created to support the performance of the student, the teacher, and the tutor, by providing an electronic skills development and information hub. The Reading CAT is being developed by Concordia University who is a subcontractor to Success for All. The Reading CAT will be used for practice (by students), for assessment (by tutors and teachers), for performance support (by tutors), and for communication (by tutors, teachers, and the facilitator). A large scale evaluation will compare schools using all technology elements to matched schools using standard SFA and to control schools over a two-year period.</AbstractNarration>
