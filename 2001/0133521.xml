    <AbstractNarration>The problem of data synchronization is inherent to systems that require consistency among&lt;br/&gt;distributed information. In light ofthe vision of pervasive computing, in which any two mo-&lt;br/&gt;bile or fixed computing devices would be able tointeract, data synchronization is increasingly&lt;br/&gt;becoming an essential technology.&lt;br/&gt;To date, most research on data synchronization has focused on database issues related to&lt;br/&gt;con ict resolution. However, we feelthat current trends towards pervasive computing point&lt;br/&gt;to communication becoming the primary bottleneck for synchronization. For example, the&lt;br/&gt;Palm Pilot IIIxe, a popular and representative Personal Digital Assistant, can take even 20&lt;br/&gt;minutes to synchronize with a desktop PC in certain practical scenarios. There are many&lt;br/&gt;other diverse examples of the need for communication-aware data synchronization, including&lt;br/&gt;synchronization of mobile data, resource discovery, and even reconciliation of nucleotide&lt;br/&gt;sequences in DNA.&lt;br/&gt;We intend to investigate practical data synchronization techniques that minimize com-&lt;br/&gt;munication complexity, building upon a foundation of recent research connecting such tech-&lt;br/&gt;niques to graph coloring problems and the design of error-control codes. These connections&lt;br/&gt;allow for application of the latest results in these fields, such as the capacity-approaching Low&lt;br/&gt;Density Parity-Check codes, to important synchronization issues. The synchronized schemes&lt;br/&gt;we propose to research promise to be much faster and more general than those currently in&lt;br/&gt;use, offering applications to fault-tolerance, file synchronization, and image comparison.&lt;br/&gt;At the same time, we outline an ambitious, but attainable, educational plan based on&lt;br/&gt;years of experience with a diverse body of students. Our goals include: 1) strengthening&lt;br/&gt;ties with high schools through mentoring involvement in prize-based research programs; 2)&lt;br/&gt;expanding involvement of undergraduates in the proposed research through targeted projects&lt;br/&gt;and collaboration with graduate students; 3) enhancing graduate education through the use&lt;br/&gt;of real-life projects and raw, unfinished research. We have already begun to work towards&lt;br/&gt;these goals and describe some of our successes.</AbstractNarration>
