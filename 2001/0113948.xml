    <AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the architecture and design of a single-chip&lt;br/&gt;parallel computer system. As technology continues to improve and transistor&lt;br/&gt;sizes decrease, the latency of on-chip interconnect wires will have a&lt;br/&gt;greater impact on the performance of computer systems. In the future,&lt;br/&gt;computer designers will need to develop architectures that avoid the use of&lt;br/&gt;long interconnect wires in order to reduce the effect of this latency. One&lt;br/&gt;such approach would be to include a number of small, simple processors&lt;br/&gt;together on a single chip, forming a single-chip parallel computer. This&lt;br/&gt;would reduce the effect of the latency because the length of the&lt;br/&gt;interconnect wires would depend on the size and complexity of the&lt;br/&gt;individual processors, not the size of the entire system. By keeping the&lt;br/&gt;processors simple, long interconnect wires will not be necessary. The&lt;br/&gt;challenge to designing such a system is determining the features that the&lt;br/&gt;architecture must include. This research project will investigate&lt;br/&gt;architectural features that provide low-overhead support for parallel&lt;br/&gt;programs, applying them to the design of the SCMP (Single-Chip&lt;br/&gt;Message-Passing) parallel computer. Through the extensive use of&lt;br/&gt;simulation, the design and performance of the SCMP system will be analyzed&lt;br/&gt;and compared to other computer architectures.</AbstractNarration>
