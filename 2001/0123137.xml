    <AbstractNarration>The scholarship program is structured to support 32 minority and/or female student participants.&lt;br/&gt;Scholars are selected from students who have or will receive associate degrees in science&lt;br/&gt;and technology from appropriate programs and who express intent to major in one of the&lt;br/&gt;CSEMS disciplines. Students are recruited primarily, but not exclusively, from the&lt;br/&gt;local/state community college(s) participating in articulation agreement(s) with Southern&lt;br/&gt;University. Scholars are selected based on financial need and academic achievement.&lt;br/&gt;Students are co-advised by academic mentors. They participate in structured mentoring programs and various student development seminars/workshops, register with the SU Career Services Office, and participate in Career Services-offered career workshops.&lt;br/&gt;The scholarship program helps improve retention rates for capable&lt;br/&gt;students citing financial difficulties as reasons not to complete bachelor's degrees in CSEMS&lt;br/&gt;fields. Retention will also improve due to better preparedness of students having received&lt;br/&gt;needed remedial instruction before they come to the four-year college.</AbstractNarration>
