    <AbstractNarration>This proposal aims to investigate the impact of the new I/O&lt;br/&gt;technologies on the operating system architecture of the network servers. &lt;br/&gt;The key ingredient of the proposed approach is the memory-to-memory &lt;br/&gt;intra-server interconnect which allows non-intrusive communication &lt;br/&gt;between hosts and intelligent devices. Memory-to-memory communication &lt;br/&gt;eliminates or significantly reduces the overhead typically associated with &lt;br/&gt;conventional communication protocols. This benefit has been extensively &lt;br/&gt;studied to improve the performance of distributed applications but has not &lt;br/&gt;been yet explored in support of the operating system performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will focus on how to split the operating system functionality&lt;br/&gt;across a cluster of computing nodes and intelligent devices. Two novel &lt;br/&gt;operating mechanisms based on memory-to-memory communication will be &lt;br/&gt;explored: (i) direct application-to-device communication to offload the &lt;br/&gt;TCP/IP protocol processing to TCP servers executed on intelligent network &lt;br/&gt;interfaces or dedicated nodes, and (ii) direct communication between &lt;br/&gt;memory-mapped file servers and TCP servers. The research will also &lt;br/&gt;investigate how to use memory-to-memory communication to support cooperative &lt;br/&gt;file and network servers for availability and load-balancing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been considerably motivated by the increasing interest&lt;br/&gt;in VIA, InfiniBand, and programmable device controllers. Its ultimate goal is &lt;br/&gt;to contribute to the understanding of how systems software should be designed&lt;br/&gt;to exploit and combine these new technologies.</AbstractNarration>
