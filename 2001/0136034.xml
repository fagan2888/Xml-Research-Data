    <AbstractNarration>Plant sterols represent a complex array of chemical compounds that are&lt;br/&gt;essential for many facets of plant growth and development, and are of&lt;br/&gt;considerable importance for their nutritional contributions to animals and&lt;br/&gt;man. Hence, it is not surprising that the biochemistry and molecular&lt;br/&gt;biology of the sterol biosynthetic pathway has been intensively studied.&lt;br/&gt;Nonetheless, very little is actually known about the regulation of this&lt;br/&gt;biochemical pathway in plants. One goal of our long-term research in sterol&lt;br/&gt;metabolism has been focussed on the regulation of squalene synthase, a key&lt;br/&gt;enzyme in sterol biosynthetic enzyme. Our recent results suggest that&lt;br/&gt;squalene synthase gene expression and enzyme activity are localized to&lt;br/&gt;shoot meristems. In attempting to reconcile these results with those&lt;br/&gt;already reported in the literature, the most logical interpretation is that&lt;br/&gt;sterol biosynthesis itself is localized to this tissue. This interpretation&lt;br/&gt;implies that regulation of sterol biosynthesis occurs in the shoot&lt;br/&gt;meristem, a tissue that has not been evaluated as such before, and that a&lt;br/&gt;sterol transport system for the movement of sterol from the apical meristem&lt;br/&gt;throughout the plant must exist. Experiments to test these predictions are&lt;br/&gt;proposed and include: 1, an evaluation if sterol biosynthesis localized to&lt;br/&gt;the shoot meristem is regulated; 2, the development of a test for long&lt;br/&gt;distance transport of sterol within plants; and 3, a determination if NPC1,&lt;br/&gt;a highly conserved protein involved in cholesterol uptake and intracellular&lt;br/&gt;trafficking, plays a similar role in plants as in animals. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;work, which will involve undergraduate and graduate students and a&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral associate, should provide important insights into how this&lt;br/&gt;pathway might be engineered for enhanced value using emerging technologies.</AbstractNarration>
