    <AbstractNarration>In IC fabrication chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is used to planarize surfaces of&lt;br/&gt;conductors like aluminum, tungsten, tantalum and copper and dielectrics like silicon dioxide,&lt;br/&gt;silicon nitride, and low-k polymers. The CMP process is the only technique available now to&lt;br/&gt;provide surfaces across the die and wafer with planarity sufficient to meet the stringent depth of&lt;br/&gt;focus requirements of shorter wavelength lithographic techniques. The CMP of low-k polymeric&lt;br/&gt;materials and architectures overlaid on these polymers is challenging. This is because the low-k&lt;br/&gt;polymeric materials are mechanically softer and even porous, can flow under heat, and have&lt;br/&gt;hydrophobic surfaces. There exists a critical need for developing low pressure, selective, and&lt;br/&gt;effective CMP process of the new, low-k polymers and architectures overlaid on these polymers.&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this program is to develop a novel approach using magnetically&lt;br/&gt;responsive slurries (MRS) to conduct CMP of low-k polymers and associated structures. The&lt;br/&gt;project is a joint collaborative, interdisciplinary, synergistic effort between investigators from&lt;br/&gt;Clarkson University and University of Pittsburgh, with collaboration with industry. A&lt;br/&gt;fundamental and systematic investigation of the feasibility such a magnetically assisted CMP&lt;br/&gt;process will be conducted. The outcome of this program has the potential for a significantly high&lt;br/&gt;economic payoff. This project will have significant combined impact on the: basic science that&lt;br/&gt;forms the underpinning of the CMP technology, research infrastructure, and development of&lt;br/&gt;human resources.</AbstractNarration>
