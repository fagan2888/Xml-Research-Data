    <AbstractNarration>A first-order feature of the Tibetan Plateau is its triangular geometry on map view with its&lt;br/&gt;north-south width increasing from ~500 km in the west to &gt;1500 km in the east. This asymmetry&lt;br/&gt;has been explained by either eastward extrusion of Tibet or partitioning of north-south shortening&lt;br/&gt;in the Tian Shan and northern Tibet across the strong Tarim block. To quantify the role of lateral&lt;br/&gt;extrusion in accommodating intracontinental deformation during the Indo-Asian collision, we&lt;br/&gt;must know the timing and magnitude of slip along major Cenozoic strike-slip faults in Asia. This&lt;br/&gt;goal may be achieved by examining the termination structures of the strike-slip faults where their&lt;br/&gt;motion is transferred to dip-slip structures. In this proposal, we plan to investigate the temporal&lt;br/&gt;and spatial evolution of one of such structures: the 220-km long, north-trending Kongur Shan&lt;br/&gt;extensional system in the eastern Pamirs. In the lateral-extrusion model, the Kongur Shan&lt;br/&gt;extensional system is the northern termination of the ~1000-km long right-slip Karakorum fault,&lt;br/&gt;which is thought to have assisted Tibet to extrude hundreds of kilometers eastward. Because the&lt;br/&gt;southern end of the Kongur Shan system is assumed to link with the right-slip Karakorum fault,&lt;br/&gt;the extrusion model requires that the extensional system has progressively lengthened northward&lt;br/&gt;and its total magnitude of extension decreases from south to north. Alternatively, the oroclinal-bending&lt;br/&gt;model suggests that the development of the north-trending Kongur Shan system may&lt;br/&gt;have been related to pure bending of the Pamir-Nanga Parbat syntaxis system during Cenozoic&lt;br/&gt;northward indentation of the Pamir promontory. This hypothesis not only explains coeval east-west&lt;br/&gt;extension in the Pamirs and east-west contraction in the Nanga Parbat region in the western&lt;br/&gt;Himalayan orogen, but also predicts specifically that the Kongur Shan extensional system should&lt;br/&gt;have lengthened progressively southward and its total magnitude of extension decreases along&lt;br/&gt;strike to the south. The distinctive predictions regarding the extensional-magnitude distribution&lt;br/&gt;and propagation direction of the Kongur Shan extensional system by the two competing models&lt;br/&gt;form the basis of this proposal. We plan to conduct field mapping across the extensional system&lt;br/&gt;in four different transects, each is about 20-40 km wide, which will allow us to construct a series&lt;br/&gt;of cross sections for estimating the magnitude of extension along individual segment of the&lt;br/&gt;system. Field mapping will focus on the question of whether the Kongur Shan extensional&lt;br/&gt;system is actually linked with the Karakorum fault. We will integrate field mapping with&lt;br/&gt;thermobarometric, 40 Ar/39 Ar thermochronologic, and U-Th-Pb ion-microprobe geochronologic&lt;br/&gt;analyses to constrain the P-T-t paths for both the hangingwall and footwall of the extensional&lt;br/&gt;system. The results of this study will provide two important constraints on the tectonics of the&lt;br/&gt;western Himalayan orogen: (1) the timing and magnitude of eastward extrusion of Tibet, and (2)&lt;br/&gt;the dynamic cause for the initiation and development of coeval east-west extension and&lt;br/&gt;contraction in the western syntaxis system.</AbstractNarration>
