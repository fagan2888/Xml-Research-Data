    <AbstractNarration>0129824&lt;br/&gt;Guggenheim&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds from this grant will support an upgrade to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) capabilities of the University of Illinois at Chicago. A CCD detector equipped XRD will replace an aging Picker instrument (vintage 1968) in Earth and Environmental Sciences (E&amp;ES) and a Nonius diffractometer in Chemistry, and updates the capabilities of these laboratories. The system will allow for research that is not now possible including study of much smaller crystals, a reduction in search time for single crystals suitable for study, and rapid data collection during high-temperature experiments, especially for phyllosilicate studies. These studies often involve materials with high numbers of defects, where smaller crystallite sizes and a reduction in search time will increase productivity. In addition, the use of smaller crystals will allow new materials to be studied in-house. The E&amp;ES X-ray laboratory has served as a major university and regional facility in the Chicago metropolitan area. Routine use of the facility is made by the Departments of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Dentistry, Civil Engineering, Physics, and the Research Resources Center, in addition to visitors from outside the University. The system will provide single crystal capabilities that will substantially increase usage of the facility by a new group of researchers.&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>
