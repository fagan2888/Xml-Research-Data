    <AbstractNarration>This project will unite sensing and modeling in a virtual environment to enable simulation of as-built concrete structures and pavements. Embeddable sensors will be developed to utilize acoustic, electric, ultrasonic, and thermal measurements as complementary technologies, thereby enabling the in-place concrete quality and integrity to be measured. The predicted development of concrete properties will be compared with real-time field measurements to allow the stiffness, porosity, load, and damage to be adjusted to accurately represent the field concrete. Energy based damage criteria will be developed to compare information obtained from the sensor with the model predictions. This information will be used to characterize existing damage and to quantify the risk for future irreversible damage and deterioration. This modeling approach can permit contractors and inspectors to implement corrective actions during construction that can improve long-term performance. In addition to providing information during construction, these models will utilize early-age measurements to compute long-term performance. These models can be used to provide the owners of a structure with the feedback needed to assess alternate construction strategies, to determine pay adjustments, or to plan repair strategies. At the conclusion of this project the life-cycle performance models may be utilized by a wide range of users which could include governmental agencies (departments of transportation), material suppliers, contractors, insurance and surety companies, repair material producers, researchers, and students to predict the long-term performance of structures and to assess the success of innovative material and design improvements. In addition to the research, this project is focused on preparing both the construction engineer and the construction workforce for tomorrow. This project utilizes a 'problem-based-education' approach to encourage high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to consider careers in civil engineering materials through 'hands-on' projects in which they will learn to diagnose problems, conduct independent research, and develop solution procedures. In addition, this project will use continuing education courses and demonstrations to inform practicing engineers, concrete laborers and testing technicians of the project developments.</AbstractNarration>
