    <AbstractNarration>This career development project focuses on an experimental study of a novel type of "designer solid" consisting of a sample of ultracold Rydberg atoms that are strongly coupled by long range dipole-dipole interactions. The experiments investigate a new form of this designer solid -a Rydberg atom crystal. The research works toward developing the ability to control interactions between individual atoms in this strongly coupled spin system at the level required to produce the entanglement necessary for quantum computations. The table top scale of the proposed research provides excellent opportunities for student involvement at a variety of levels. In addition, the work seeks to broaden the exposure of a group of successful women scientists to the larger community. Undergraduate students are involved in the development of a conceptual physics course as student teachers whose duties go well beyond those of a typical teaching assistant. They explore teaching pedagogies, help implement innovative teaching methods, and help build lecture demonstration resources. Student outreach is being extended beyond the confines of the college through a physics demonstration show, which travels to local K-12 schools.</AbstractNarration>
