    <AbstractNarration>This research examines the health impact of the Wari empire (AD 600 - 1000) on populations in the state's heartland and periphery through paleopathological, dietary, and demographic analyses of archaeological human remains. The Wari state originated in the central Andean highlands (near modern-day Ayacucho) and incorporated populations throughout the Andes, including those of the Majes valley in south-central Peru. Demographic, paleopathological, and stable isotopic bone composition data are collected from three archaeological skeletal samples-two from the peripheral Majes valley (sites, La Real and Beringa) and one from the heartland urban Wari site in the Ayacucho valley, Conchopata-to document past rural and urban community health during the period of the Wari rule. These data are then used to compare differences in health status, if any, between those in the heartland and periphery, as well as document (dis)similarities between the two peripheral Majes valley skeletal populations that experienced interaction with Wari. Finally, data on sex- and class-based health and dietary differences are used to consider past social and gender roles and organization.</AbstractNarration>
