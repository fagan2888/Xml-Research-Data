    <AbstractNarration>Speculative execution has been widely used in computer architecture&lt;br/&gt;research in the pursuit of higher levels of instruction level&lt;br/&gt;parallelism. However, recent studies have shown that this technique&lt;br/&gt;can significantly impact the scalability of the processor pipeline.&lt;br/&gt;This research will investigate a number of speculative techniques&lt;br/&gt;with respect to performance, scalability, energy efficiency, area&lt;br/&gt;costs, and complexity; eventually leading to a novel, scalable&lt;br/&gt;architecture to provide high performance at future technology sizes.&lt;br/&gt;Such an architecture will minimize the amount of logic on the&lt;br/&gt;critical timing path of the processor, relying on small speculative&lt;br/&gt;structures to reduce the cycle time of the processor. Off the&lt;br/&gt;critical path, a variety of larger speculative structures provide a&lt;br/&gt;backing store to the critical path.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the techniques to be examined in this research include&lt;br/&gt;branch prediction, value and address prediction, data prefetching,&lt;br/&gt;early register release and late register allocation, and multiple&lt;br/&gt;clustered functional units. Many of these techniques require large&lt;br/&gt;and often complex predictors that can impact the cycle time and power&lt;br/&gt;density of a processor. This research investigates some techniques&lt;br/&gt;to reduce the access time and size of these structures, while still&lt;br/&gt;providing the accuracy to avoid costly speculative recovery&lt;br/&gt;procedures.</AbstractNarration>
