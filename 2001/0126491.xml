    <AbstractNarration>Geology (42)&lt;br/&gt;We are developing a new Applied Geophysics course that represents an adaptation of a pedagogical model developed at the University of Massachusetts. We are also creating new opportunities for undergraduate research in geophysics. The lab component of our Applied Geophysics course includes six modules dedicated to seismic refraction and reflection, ground-penetrating radar, gravimetry, direct-current electrical methods, magnetic surveying, and cross-hole geophysics. Two four-hour field labs are devoted to each module. The instructor designs the first survey using each method, for the purposes of demonstrating proper survey design, data collection, safety measures, and data reduction. Alternating groups of students lead the second lab in each module, thus calling on student groups to take leadership roles in designing surveys, assessing the limitations of various methods through forward modeling, and organizing data collection efforts. The instructor-led experiments take advantage of diverse sites off campus. Student-led surveys are being conducted at various locations on campus, including our Geophysical Test Site and adjacent Experimental Well Field. Interpretations incorporate complementary data sets from multiple geophysical methods. New access to state-of-the-art geophysical equipment is having a major positive impact not only on the preparation of geology majors, but also on other physical science and engineering students.</AbstractNarration>
