    <AbstractNarration>The goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) project is to investigate the potential performance of fixtures utilizing Light Assisted Adhesive Gripper (LAAG) pad technology; and, to characterize the design factors that are critical to its feasible implementation. In particular, this investigation will: (1) carry out machining tests to verify the dynamic load capacity of a LAAG pad; (2) carryout a dynamic response comparison between a dedicated fixture-workpiece system utilizing conventional technology versus one utilizing LAAG pad technology; (3) determine the necessary optical qualities of the light transmission system, and generate and test a practical design; and, (4) carry out laser release experiments in order to determine the impact of laser switching frequency, laser wavelength, laser power, and adhesive thickness on workpiece release time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In particular, the successful development of LAAG pad technology could lead to the following benefits: (1) The total exposed volume of fixturing necessary to restrain a workpiece will be significantly decreased, while simultaneously the dynamic stiffness of the fixture-workpiece system will be significantly increased. (2) Workpiece degradation due to pre-load deformation and contact surface brinelling and scratching will be eliminated.</AbstractNarration>
