    <AbstractNarration>Professor John Wright of the University of Wisconsin-Madison is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to study coherent two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy. Doubly vibrationally enhanced (DOVE) four wave mixing (FWM) methods pioneered by this group will be complemented by new doubly degenerate FWM methods, such as the use of two tunable infrared lasers to drive three infrared transitions and a fourth output beam. These methods will be used in a variety of ways to explore the utility of coherent two dimensional methods for analytical measurements. Certain advantages such as line-narrowing and selective component enhancement in complex mixtures can be achieved, relieving current problems in vibrational spectroscopy such as spectral congestion. Hydrogen bonded liquids will be studied. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Infrared spectroscopy is commonly used to study and monitor industrial processes analytically. New laser-based spectroscopic methods can potentially make more tractable the IR spectroscopy of proteins, for example, which will be of use in basic and applied biochemical and biotechnological research.</AbstractNarration>
