    <AbstractNarration>Proposal Number: DMS-0140513&lt;br/&gt;PI: Boris Kalinin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research lies at the area of smooth dynamical&lt;br/&gt;systems and ergodic theory. The main goal of the project is&lt;br/&gt;to investigate "higher rank" dynamical systems. In&lt;br/&gt;particular, the investigator will study actions of discrete&lt;br/&gt;and continuous higher rank abelian groups, which are natural&lt;br/&gt;generalizations of diffeomorphisms and flows on smooth&lt;br/&gt;manifolds. Higher rank dynamical systems appear naturally in&lt;br/&gt;the study of various geometric and algebraic objects. The&lt;br/&gt;prime examples of these systems include hyperbolic and&lt;br/&gt;partially hyperbolic actions by automorphisms and&lt;br/&gt;translations on compact cosets of Lie groups. Using dynamical,&lt;br/&gt;analytic, and group theoretic methods the investigator&lt;br/&gt;will study rigidity properties of such systems. The examples&lt;br/&gt;of possible rigidity properties include description of&lt;br/&gt;invariant measures, regularity of measurable isomorphisms,&lt;br/&gt;and existence of smooth isomorphisms to the algebraic models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems and ergodic theory is a relatively new field&lt;br/&gt;of mathematics which studies the evolution of physical and&lt;br/&gt;mathematical systems over time, for example planet systems,&lt;br/&gt;air and fluid flows. This field originated from the classical&lt;br/&gt;studies in differential equations and celestial mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;Dynamics and ergodic theory introduced new mathematical tools&lt;br/&gt;into these areas of physics and mechanics, such as the study&lt;br/&gt;of the qualitative behavior in the long run as well as various&lt;br/&gt;analytic and probabilistic methods. New ideas and concepts in&lt;br/&gt;dynamics, such as fractals and chaos, have not only affected&lt;br/&gt;the field itself dramatically, but also fundamentally changed&lt;br/&gt;our understanding of the world. The influence of the studies&lt;br/&gt;in dynamical systems nowadays goes as far as meteorology, &lt;br/&gt;biology, and computer science.</AbstractNarration>
