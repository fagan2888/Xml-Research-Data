The workshops are held in Washington, DC and are open to all recent doctorates and advanced graduate students in computing disciplines. Topics incorporated in the workshops include development of effective teaching practices, research programs, and developing a successful academic career overall. Senior computer scientists and engineers conduct the workshops and program managers from NSF and DARPA discussing how their research funding programs are organized are also part of the workshops.</AbstractNarration>
