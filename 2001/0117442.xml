    <AbstractNarration>This research will establish the long-term trends, variations, and extremes of regional climate by examining variations in annual growth rings of old-aged trees in Mongolia and China dating back to 800 A.D. Mongolia and the surrounding region are the center of the Asian High, the most extreme atmospheric pressure center of the Northern Hemisphere and a strong influence on winter atmospheric circulation. The goal of the research is to understand climate trends that impact global weather patterns. The effects of changing climate may be severe on Mongolia and changes in the Asian High can have effects far beyond the immediate region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The tree-ring samples, obtained nondestructively, will be used to develop calendar-dated, annual to millennial-length records of climate variations. Long records are essential because recorded information (approximately 50 years) does not reveal the full range of variability and trends in climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sampling sites are high in mountains or at the edge of dry grasslands where the trees are stressed by climate. Such tree-rings record the effects of warm and cold years in the mountains and wet and dry years near the grasslands. The resulting records will yield valuable information about temperature trends, severe winters, droughts, floods, and other climatic variations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is conducted in cooperation with Mongolian Universities, institutions, and government agencies. A Tree-Ring Laboratory has been organized at the National University and seminars and workshops are planned to teach and train students and scientists for cooperative and independent research.</AbstractNarration>
