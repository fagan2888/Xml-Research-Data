    <AbstractNarration>Biological Sciences (61)&lt;br/&gt;This project is providing opportunities for students to design, conduct, analyze, and report on inquiry-based laboratory projects in developmental biology by adapting from the contemporary research literature techniques of microsurgery, microinjection, and digital imaging for use by undergraduates. These research techniques are being implemented within inquiry-based undergraduate laboratory projects that investigate cell fate, cell morphology, and organogenesis. Thus, students have valuable opportunities to incorporate&lt;br/&gt;some of the most important and broadly applicable techniques of modern developmental biology research within experimental questions of their own design. By actively engaging students in all phases of scientific inquiry from experimental design through execution, analysis, and communication, students learn valuable technical, intellectual, communicative, and collaborative skills. Further, students are merging both classical embryology and modern developmental biology to obtain unique first-hand perspectives on how animal form and function arise.</AbstractNarration>
