    <AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Sturgeons, paddlefishes and their fossil relatives form a small&lt;br/&gt;group of fishes from the Northern hemisphere called Acipenseriformes that&lt;br/&gt;is believed to have split off from other ray-finned fishes (the&lt;br/&gt;actinopterygians) some 150 million years ago. The morphology of living&lt;br/&gt;sturgeons (25 species) has remained largely unchanged since they first&lt;br/&gt;evolved. Although there have been many studies of sturgeon morphology,&lt;br/&gt;there never has been a study that is detailed or comprehensive enough to&lt;br/&gt;allow modern studies of their evolution. The new study of the skeleton of&lt;br/&gt;fossil and living sturgeons by Hilton, Grande and Bemis has two main goals.&lt;br/&gt;The first objective is to describe in detail the skeleton of the shortnose&lt;br/&gt;sturgeon (Acipenser brevirostrum), a small species of sturgeon found in&lt;br/&gt;coastal rivers of eastern North America. This study will be based on&lt;br/&gt;several types of specimens, including dry skeletons, hand cleaned skeletons&lt;br/&gt;that are stored in alcohol, and cleared and stained skeletons (in which the&lt;br/&gt;soft tissue is made clear, cartilage is stained blue and bone is stained&lt;br/&gt;red). Specimens representing all life history stages will be studied, from&lt;br/&gt;the earliest embryos to the oldest specimens available. Such an approach&lt;br/&gt;allows observations of changes of morphology due to growth and development&lt;br/&gt;of the skeleton. The results of this study will be published in a large&lt;br/&gt;format monograph, illustrated with photographs for documentation and line&lt;br/&gt;drawings for interpretation, accompanied by clear text descriptions. The&lt;br/&gt;intention is that this monograph will serve as a lasting contribution to&lt;br/&gt;the knowledge of the anatomy of sturgeons and a standard reference for&lt;br/&gt;anatomical studies of primitive ray-finned fishes.&lt;br/&gt; The second part of this study concerns tracing evolutionary&lt;br/&gt;relationships among living and fossil sturgeons. Most fossils that are&lt;br/&gt;identified as sturgeons are very fragmentary, and only after a detailed&lt;br/&gt;study of the living members of a group can such specimens be properly&lt;br/&gt;interpreted. Additionally, new comparative data generated during the first&lt;br/&gt;part of the study will be used to formulate new hypotheses of&lt;br/&gt;relationships. All previous morphological studies of the relationships of&lt;br/&gt;sturgeons are inadequate for various reasons. For instance, many studies&lt;br/&gt;have looked only at relationships of sturgeons from a particular geographic&lt;br/&gt;region or country. Evolution has not occurred within political boundaries,&lt;br/&gt;and Hilton, Grande and Bemis' study will be the first to incorporate&lt;br/&gt;morphological data for all sturgeons on a worldwide scale. All species of&lt;br/&gt;sturgeons are afforded some form of protection, with many listed as&lt;br/&gt;endangered. The precarious conservation status of many sturgeons make&lt;br/&gt;studies of their evolutionary history even more critical.</AbstractNarration>
