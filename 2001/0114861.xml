    <AbstractNarration>0114861&lt;br/&gt;Hunziker&lt;br/&gt;This award supports Janet Hunziker of the National Academy of Sciences and junior and senior researchers from various U.S. universities to participate in an international workshop on several current engineering topics. The four primary areas to be covered are 1) medical device technology, 2) urban engineering and planning, 3) intelligent transportation systems, and 4) environment and renewable energy. Speakers will be asked to address issues such as what the frontiers in their field are; what experiments and prototypes are in progress; what new tools and instruments are available; what the major impediments to progress are; and what the theoretical, commercial, societal, and long-term significance of the work is. Invitees will be accomplished engineers who have made recognized contributions to advancing the frontiers of engineering, with half those present from industry and half from academia. The primary benefit of the workshop will be to foster new interactions between the best junior U.S. and German engineers from different fields and sectors. Today's most exciting and powerful engineering developments are occurring at the intersection of disciplines. By creating the opportunity for sharing of research insights and techniques across a range of fields, this workshop will facilitate leaps in knowledge and applications that might otherwise take much longer to achieve.</AbstractNarration>
