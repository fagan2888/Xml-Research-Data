    <AbstractNarration>This project involves continued research on the geometric,&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic and combinatorial aspects of functional analysis and&lt;br/&gt;convexity theory, with particular attention to noncommutative objects and&lt;br/&gt;phenomena. While most of the problems considered in the project have&lt;br/&gt;motivation in other fields of mathematical sciences, they are typically&lt;br/&gt;expressed in the language of local or finite dimensional geometry of Banach&lt;br/&gt;spaces and/or analyzed using the methods prevalent in that area. Sample&lt;br/&gt;research topics include: entropy of linear operators and duality of such&lt;br/&gt;entropy, structural properties of high-dimensional convex bodies, various&lt;br/&gt;analytic and geometric questions related to random matrices, some problems&lt;br/&gt;in the "local" operator theory, Gaussian correlation of convex sets,&lt;br/&gt;concentration phenomenon in the noncommutative context and some geometric&lt;br/&gt;questions related to free and quantum information theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; On an elementary level, Analysis is a study of functions, or&lt;br/&gt;relationships between quantities and the parameters on which they depend.&lt;br/&gt;As it happens, very many naturally appearing relationships are linear or&lt;br/&gt;at least convex. Thus, a good understanding of convex functions and,&lt;br/&gt;consequently, of convex sets is a prerequisite for understanding those&lt;br/&gt;relationships. The number of free parameters in the underlying problem can&lt;br/&gt;often be related to the dimension of sets in the corresponding mathematical&lt;br/&gt;model. Since real-life problems usually do depend on very many parameters,&lt;br/&gt;the high-dimensional setting is of particular interest. This is exactly&lt;br/&gt;the domain of Asymptotic Geometric Analysis, which studies quantitative&lt;br/&gt;properties of convex sets as the dimension goes to infinity. It&lt;br/&gt;constitutes a fertile middle ground between the classical Functional&lt;br/&gt;Analysis and the classical Geometry. Functional Analysis is usually&lt;br/&gt;concerned with the infinite-dimensional setting (which frequently is an&lt;br/&gt;idealization of a very large dimension), but it often provides only&lt;br/&gt;qualitative information. On the other hand, Geometry typically yields&lt;br/&gt;very precise information for a specific not-too-large dimension. For the&lt;br/&gt;last two decades or so the asymptotic theory has been quite successful in&lt;br/&gt;identifying and exploiting "approximate" symmetries of various problems&lt;br/&gt;that escaped the earlier "too qualitative" or "too rigid" methods. (This&lt;br/&gt;led, among others, to the discovery of many links to Computer Science.)&lt;br/&gt;Finally, to explain our interest in noncommutativity we point out that it&lt;br/&gt;simply reflects the fact that the final outcome of a process may depend on&lt;br/&gt;the order of operations involved; the best known, but by far not the only&lt;br/&gt;manifestation of that principle is quantum mechanics.</AbstractNarration>
