    <AbstractNarration>Dr. Graham R. Fleming of the University of California at Berkeley is funded for his research on optical studies of condensed phase dynamics by a grant in the Physical Chemistry program of the Chemistry Division. He will develop and apply new ultrafast laser spectroscopic methods to the dynamics of complex condensed phase systems. Specifically, he will develop heterodyne-detected, two-dimensional Raman spectroscopy, and two-color resonant photon echo spectroscopy for the study of liquid and glass dynamics, and the study of multichromophoric molecular complexes, respectively. Undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students will receive training and education in experimental design, measurement, and theoretical analysis. Students will be prepared to lead independent research programs at major research universities, National Laboratories, and private industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exceedingly short pulses of laser light with duration of a few thousandths of a trillionth of a second will be used to follow the motions of molecules during chemical reactions, and to study the processes involved in the collection and transfer of solar energy in nanoscale devices designed to mimic and extend the light harvesting function of the natural photosynthetic system of plants. The long range goals of this research are to reveal the design principles necessary for renewable energy sources based on solar energy, to provide new analytical methods for the study and optimization of chemical processes, and to train the next generation of U.S. scientists.</AbstractNarration>
