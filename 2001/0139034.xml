    <AbstractNarration>This award provides support for an REU Site in Cognitive Development at Yale University. The goal is to provide undergraduates with an interest in developmental psychology from a cognitive science perspective to gain mentored research experience over the summer. The intellectual focus of the research will be on how children and adults grasp the causal structure o the world around them. Students will be involved in experimental design, data collection, data analysis, and presentation of results of various studies. Weekly laboratory meetings as well as several forms of training and small group meetings form an instructional component to the internship. Six to eight students, recruited nationally, will be involved in the 12-week program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.</AbstractNarration>
