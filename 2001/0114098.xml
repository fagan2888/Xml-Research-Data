    <AbstractNarration>This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Ohio State University to replace the existing obsolete X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with an new system having higher sensitivity, spatial resolution and novel sample handling features. The system will be located at the Center for Materials Research (CMR) and is designed for use by a variety of investigators in science and engineering departments, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Physics, Materials Science and Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The XPS systems will support a variety of federally funded projects, including investigations of carbon based molecular electronic devices (NSF), corrosion of light weight alloys (AFOSR, SERDP), conducting polymers and light emitting diodes (DARPA), zeolite based chemical sensors (NSF, DOE), and oxidation catalysts for exhaust gases (DOE). In addition to examining research problems from various research projects, the facility will be used to instruct undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students on the applications of XPS for surface characterization. OSU has a long history of education and outreach activities involving local and visiting students, including summer research projects for undergraduates and science education programs for K-12 students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program will allow Ohio State University to replace the existing obsolete X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with an new system having higher sensitivity, spatial resolution and novel sample handling features.
