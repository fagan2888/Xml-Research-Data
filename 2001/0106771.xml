    <AbstractNarration>We propose a research project to investigate the impact of qualitative analysis on undergraduate students' conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills within the realistic setting of large introductory physics courses. The impact of qualitive analysis (QA) will be investigated both within a web-based homework environment and during acttive-learning, in-class formative assessment activities facilitated by a classroom communication system. The applications of web-based homework, and classroom communication systems, are proliferating in large introductory science courses nationwide. Yet, little is known about how to structure web-based homework, and active-learning in-calss activities in ways that engage students in qualitive analyses that promote a deeper understanding of scientific concepts and skilled problem solving. The QA materials that will be ddeveloped and investigated will engage students in four types of qualitative analyses performed by skilled problem solvers corresponding roughly to four stages of expert-like problem solving: conceptual alnalysis, strategic analysis. quanititative analysis, and meta analysis. We will investigate the effectiveness of these materials and their impact on: a) students' understanding on concepts and their ability to analyze and solve problems, b) students' approach to, and level of success with, web-based homework, and c) students' attitudes as they relate tot their web-based homework and in-class experience. The proposed research will utlimately infor the design and implemention of qualitative analyses in large, techonology-assisted introductory science courses in order to promote deep conceptual understanding and skilled problem solving in students.</AbstractNarration>
