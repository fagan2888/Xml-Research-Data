    <AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;CTS-0128860&lt;br/&gt;R. D. Shelton, WTEC, Inc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial support for the organization and travel of invited speakers participating at the Workshop on Nano- and Related Technologies for Improving Human Performance, December 3-4, 2001, at NSF, will be provided. The objective of the meeting is to evaluate the current research results and discuss future research directions in the emerging interdisciplinary field dealing with synergistic implications of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognition on improving human performance. Nanotechnology is opening an array of technological developments that may significantly improve human perception, sensing, adaptation, learning, human-machine interface, communication, group creativity, and other aspects of human activities. The workshop will provide input from about thirty leading experts in various areas from science, engineering, cognitive sciences, medicine and other disciplines. Specialists from academe and industry will attempt to identify common principles and approaches and develop collaborations. The workshop will be organized with plenary presentations and 4-5 breakout sessions. There will be about sixty participants, including observers from various agencies, academic and private organizations.&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of the workshop are to evaluate the potential role of nano related technologies on improving human performance, identify research opportunities, and develop a strategic plan for the future. Ample time will be allowed for questions and discussions. The workshop is expected to facilitate the establishment of interdisciplinary cooperation among researchers in academe, industry and government in the in the area technology implication on human improvement. A website will be established for timely communication and dissemination of the results. A report will be prepared at the end of the meeting.</AbstractNarration>
