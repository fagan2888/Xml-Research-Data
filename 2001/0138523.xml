    <AbstractNarration>There are two main research directions in this project.&lt;br/&gt;The first one is the continuation of the work on a &lt;br/&gt;general theory of boundary values, in the sense of &lt;br/&gt;analytic functionals or hyperfunctions. In its present &lt;br/&gt;state this theory has clarified several points in the&lt;br/&gt;study of boundary values of functions, in particular&lt;br/&gt;viz the intrinsic character of the definitions. Points&lt;br/&gt;which they have clarified in the global setting need&lt;br/&gt;further study in the local version. A theory in the &lt;br/&gt;non real analytic setting is still to be done. The &lt;br/&gt;second direction is at the confluent of pluri-potential&lt;br/&gt;theory and complex geometry. A still remote goal is&lt;br/&gt;the possible extension of Poletsky's theory of disks&lt;br/&gt;to the case of almost complex manifolds, whose role&lt;br/&gt;in Mathematics is rapidly growing. It also leads&lt;br/&gt;to the study of approximate solutions to the d-bar&lt;br/&gt;operator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary field of this proposal is Several&lt;br/&gt;Complex Variables. This field is rich due to its&lt;br/&gt;connections to many fields in Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;There is in particular a remarkable interplay between&lt;br/&gt;Several Complex Variables and the theory of&lt;br/&gt;Partial Differential Equations, which itself is&lt;br/&gt;the most basic tool in the study of many processes&lt;br/&gt;in Physics and Engineering. The first direction discussed&lt;br/&gt;above fits in that setting. In applications &lt;br/&gt;quantitative studies have often to be replaced &lt;br/&gt;by qualitative studies, either because the&lt;br/&gt;quantitative study is too difficult or because the&lt;br/&gt;qualitative study is in fact more illuminating. This&lt;br/&gt;is where the field of Topology is essential.&lt;br/&gt;Several important connections exist between Several&lt;br/&gt;Complex Variables and Topology. The second direction&lt;br/&gt;discussed above fits in that setting. Deformation theory&lt;br/&gt;is a major theme, in which the study of almost complex&lt;br/&gt;structures has already played a crucial role.</AbstractNarration>
