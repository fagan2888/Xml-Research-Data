    <AbstractNarration>With modern processor architectures, programs can achieve good&lt;br/&gt;performance only if they possess sufficient data locality to exploit&lt;br/&gt;on-chip caches. This research focuses on developing and evaluating&lt;br/&gt;software support for improving locality for advanced scientific&lt;br/&gt;applications for both sequential and parallel machines. The basic&lt;br/&gt;premise is that both compile-time analyses and sophisticated run-time&lt;br/&gt;systems are necessary. Run-time systems are needed because many&lt;br/&gt;programs are not analyzable statically. Compiler support is crucial&lt;br/&gt;both for inserting interfaces to the run-time system and for directly&lt;br/&gt;applying program transformations where possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal investigates locality optimizations needed for three&lt;br/&gt;features found in advanced scientific applications (3D arrays,&lt;br/&gt;irregular accesses, and pointers). It focuses on extending&lt;br/&gt;locality optimizations to handle cache conflicts between multiple&lt;br/&gt;data, deep memory hierarchies (multi-level caches and TLBs), hardware&lt;br/&gt;and software prefetching, nonlinear memory layouts, parallel and&lt;br/&gt;cluster architectures, and memory performance tools. Locality&lt;br/&gt;optimizations will be applied to representative programs and&lt;br/&gt;experimentally evaluated on advanced computer systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research should help improve the performance&lt;br/&gt;of computationally intensive scientific applications. Because&lt;br/&gt;of trends in computer architectures, lessons learned are also&lt;br/&gt;likely to be useful for application domains such as image&lt;br/&gt;processing and high-performance databases.</AbstractNarration>
