    <AbstractNarration>Prince George's Community College is leading an effort to develop and implement science and mathematics courses for preservice elementary teachers in Maryland's community colleges. Courses are modeled after courses developed through the Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation and conform to a constructivist and inquiry-based approach. Mentors from two and four year colleges assist with the course development and continue working with faculty throughout the year. Courses are consistent with the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) standards, national science and mathematics education standards, and Maryland state technology standards. The science and mathematics course development is part of a larger effort to establish an Associate of Arts degree in Teaching in Maryland community colleges that articulates with all four year institutions in the state. Course development is based on an outcomes document that specifies a constructivist approach. Students demonstrate their understanding through performance assessments and portfolios. Partnerships between community colleges and the Future Educators Associations at local high schools are assisting in recruiting students into teacher education programs.</AbstractNarration>
