    <AbstractNarration>This program provides financial and academic support for students in marine engineering technology, marine engineering technology with license option and maritime systems engineering. Students from eight especially diverse high schools in the Houston/Galveston area are recruited to participate in the program as entering freshmen, and are tracked as a cohort over the four year duration. Selection of participants is based on an application process reviewed by a selection committee and is competitive based on standard criteria including financial need and merit. The program provides specialized diagnostic testing, tutoring, supplemental instruction, mentoring and career services to help them successfully persist, graduate and find employment or pursue a graduate degree in the engineering field. A summer bridge workshop in mathematics is a critical element in preparing the entering students.</AbstractNarration>
