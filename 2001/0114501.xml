    <AbstractNarration>This project seeks to characterize the entire range of&lt;br/&gt;Arabidopsis proteins that are regulated by interaction with 14-3-3 proteins; to identify&lt;br/&gt;components from metabolic and signal transduction pathways that utilize 14-3-3 regulators,&lt;br/&gt;and to address fundamental aspects of 14-3-3 function in plants. 14-3-3s have emerged as&lt;br/&gt;critical regulators of important and diverse cellular processes that extend to every&lt;br/&gt;tissue and organ. Indeed, 14-3-3s appear to be intrinsically necessary for regulatory&lt;br/&gt;events that are absolutely crucial to normal growth and development in many species, and&lt;br/&gt;especially in plants. Initial searches of the Arabidopsis genome predict that 14-3-3s&lt;br/&gt;interact with fully 10 to 20 percent of the Arabidopsis gene products.&lt;br/&gt;The most recognized of 14-3-3 activities involve protein kinases, phosphorylation&lt;br/&gt;events and signal transduction pathways involved in growth and development, with one&lt;br/&gt;underlying theme being that 14-3-3s bind to specific phosphorylated client proteins in&lt;br/&gt;order to influence the regulation of the target activity. The goals of the present&lt;br/&gt;project are to identify in the Arabidopsis genome client proteins that possess 14-3-3&lt;br/&gt;docking sites and to assay the interaction strength of the potential docking site against&lt;br/&gt;the family of 14-3-3 proteins in order to provide a tested, predictive algorithm for&lt;br/&gt;determining of the spectrum of 14-3-3 interactions that should be expected for each client&lt;br/&gt;protein. These data, combined with emerging data from 14-3-3 knockouts and 14-3-3 isoform&lt;br/&gt;expression patterns, should provide key insights into the potential regulatory functions&lt;br/&gt;of the 14-3-3 signal mediating molecules, and a central, fully characterized database for&lt;br/&gt;predicting 14-3-3 mediated signaling in diverse pathways.&lt;br/&gt;By highlighting potential regulatory sites across diverse gene families and metabolic&lt;br/&gt;pathways, this project will provide an integrating effect on the many projects identifying&lt;br/&gt;specific functional aspects of Arabidopsis gene families. As genes are functionally&lt;br/&gt;characterized, the 14-3-3 client database will provide immediate predictions of&lt;br/&gt;phosphorylation and 14-3-3 dependent regulation that will accelerate the understanding of&lt;br/&gt;the regulation of many gene families and metabolic and signaling pathways.</AbstractNarration>
