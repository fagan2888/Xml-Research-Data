    <AbstractNarration>This project is a partnership is a partnership between the ERC for Particle Science and Technology at the University of Florida and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The objective is to provide fundamental information concerning the effectiveness of polymeric and surfactant dispersant layers during chemical and mechanical interactions with surfaces. Direct measurement of surfaces force and characterization of dispersant layers under high applied loads, shear rates, and solution conditions will be used to develop dispersant selection criteria for optimal performance in extreme conditions. The ERC's graduate students and researchers will be working in NIST laboratories and NIST personnel will visit the ERC to present seminars and teach students in new characterization techniques.</AbstractNarration>
