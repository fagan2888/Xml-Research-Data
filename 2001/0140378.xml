    <AbstractNarration>The investigator and his coworkers study elliptic curves, special values&lt;br/&gt;of L-functions, and related topics. Some of the most interesting open&lt;br/&gt;questions and conjectures in arithmetic algebraic geometry relate&lt;br/&gt;arithmetic invariants with special values of L-functions. Iwasawa theory&lt;br/&gt;and Euler systems have proved to be among the most successful tools for&lt;br/&gt;attacking these problems, by serving as a bridge between the algebraic&lt;br/&gt;world and the analytic world. The investigator continues to pursue this&lt;br/&gt;approach, by extracting additional information from Euler systems and&lt;br/&gt;their "derivative" Kolyvagin systems. In another direction, the&lt;br/&gt;investigator and his colleagues study ranks of elliptic curves,&lt;br/&gt;especially the asymptotic distribution of ranks in families of quadratic&lt;br/&gt;twists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Elliptic curves play a central role in many parts of mathematics&lt;br/&gt;including its most applied areas. For example, elliptic curves are used&lt;br/&gt;in algorithms to encrypt data for transmission, and for efficient digital&lt;br/&gt;signatures. In its most basic form, an elliptic curve is a special kind&lt;br/&gt;of polynomial equation in two variables. Historically number theorists&lt;br/&gt;are interested in finding solutions of these equations in which the&lt;br/&gt;variables take values which are either whole numbers, or fractions. The&lt;br/&gt;rank of an elliptic curve is a basic invariant which measures the size of&lt;br/&gt;the set of solutions. The investigator and his coworkers study ranks of&lt;br/&gt;elliptic curves and their interrelations with other mathematical objects&lt;br/&gt;and concepts. These questions are related to the cryptographic&lt;br/&gt;applications of elliptic curves, which come about by considering&lt;br/&gt;solutions in which the variables take values in finite fields.</AbstractNarration>
