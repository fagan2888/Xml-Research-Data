    <AbstractNarration>A grant has been awarded to Drs. David Jenkins and Michael Lemke at the University of&lt;br/&gt;Illinois at Springfield (UIS) to purchase an image analysis suite to be used in aquatic ecology&lt;br/&gt;research and st udent (B.S., M.S.) research training. The image analysis suite will also be available&lt;br/&gt;to o ther scientists and students at t he UIS campus. The suite will be composed of three different&lt;br/&gt;research-grade Olympus microscopes: a compound light microscope with epifluorescence and&lt;br/&gt;phase-contrast capabilities; a stereo dissecting microscope; and an inverted light microscope. All&lt;br/&gt;three microscopes can be connected to a computer Image Analysis System with a digital camera,&lt;br/&gt;plus that camera can be used to photograph electrophoresis results. Finally, a Polaroid HR 6000&lt;br/&gt;Digital Palette Color Film Recorder will allow digital images to be converted to film suitable for&lt;br/&gt;publication or presentation at scientific meetings or in the classroom, and a printer will provide&lt;br/&gt;hardcopy capability.&lt;br/&gt;Research with the image analysis suite will focus on two related disciplines of aquatic ecology:&lt;br/&gt;invertebrate and microbial ecology. Aquatic invertebrate ecology research at UIS investigates:&lt;br/&gt;the potential of invertebrates as wetland indicators in central Illinois; mechanisms of organismal&lt;br/&gt;spatial patterns in temporary freshwat er ponds; empirically-based models of metapopulation&lt;br/&gt;networks and gene flow; and endosymbionts in microcrustaceans. The microscopes will be used&lt;br/&gt;frequently for all of that research (e.g., taxonomic identification, fluorescence microscopy to&lt;br/&gt;indicate symbiont presence), and images of electrophoresis gels will facilitate research on&lt;br/&gt;population genetics. Aquatic microbial ecology research at UIS heavily relies on microscopic&lt;br/&gt;analysis (e.g., fluorescent staining for enumeration and biomass) to investigate: bacterial&lt;br/&gt;population dynamics in anthropogenically-impacted st reams, t he identification of culturable and&lt;br/&gt;non-culturable river microbial communities by advanced molecular biology techniques,&lt;br/&gt;degradation of natural and t oxic subst ances by microbial assemblage (i.e. domains Bacteria and&lt;br/&gt;Archaea), and rain-pulse effects on bacterial and viral abundance. Students will be trained in use&lt;br/&gt;of the suite, and will then conduct research for independent and honor's projects, Masters theses,&lt;br/&gt;and advanced courses (e.g., Aquatic Ecology, Microbial Ecology). Ot her science faculty and&lt;br/&gt;students will also share in use of the microscopes.&lt;br/&gt;The requested instruments will permit an expansion of current research and research training,&lt;br/&gt;and will facilitate the collaboration of UIS faculty with investigators at other institutions. UIS&lt;br/&gt;students will have greatly improved training and access to important scientific equipment for&lt;br/&gt;aquatic ecology, which will in turn advance UIS r esearch capabilities and st rengthen the curricula&lt;br/&gt;in the UIS Biology and Chemistry departments.</AbstractNarration>
