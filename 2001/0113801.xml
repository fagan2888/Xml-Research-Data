    <AbstractNarration>0113801&lt;br/&gt;Affatigato&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a 36 month U.S.- China cooperative project between Dr. Mario Affatigato of Coe College and Professor Wencheng Wang, Fudan University, Shanghai, China, to study the structural origin of photosensitivity in lead glasses, and to provide an REU training opportunity for four U.S. undergraduate students. This research is designed to uncover the structural origin of photosensitivity in glass. This collaboration makes use of Coe College's expertise in glass synthesis and structure characterization, and Fudan University's work on optical properties. The expertise between the two campuses is mutually beneficial. The most impressive part of this project is the educational benefit that the U.S. students can derive from this collaboration. These exchanges will enrich the research experience of the students at Coe College, which is an undergraduate teaching college. This project provides the students a significant research experience in their undergraduate education. The proposal will be jointly supported by the National Science Foundation of China and the NSF.</AbstractNarration>
