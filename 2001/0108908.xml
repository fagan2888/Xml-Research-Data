    <AbstractNarration>0108908&lt;br/&gt;Freericks&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a conference, Spintronics 2001, to held August 9-11, 2001, at Georgetown University. This conference will deal with novel aspects and possible applications of spin-polarized transport and spin dynamics in a wide range of materials, such as magnetic semiconductors, superconductors and carbon nanotubes. The feasibility of novel hybrid devices, including spin transistors, spin filters and memory devices, and their future technological impact will be the main focus of this meeting. Scientists with very diverse backgrounds will be encouraged to participate, with the goal to bring together expertise and ideas from different scientific communities and provide a broad view of the status and perspectives of spintronics research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports conference costs for young participants (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty).&lt;br/&gt;%%%&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a conference, Spintronics 2001, to held August 9-11, 2001, at Georgetown University.
