    <AbstractNarration>The CSAM (Computer Science and Mathematics) Scholars program at the College of William and Mary annually provides financial and academic assistance to 26 academically talented, financially needy students who express a desire to pursue degrees in mathematics and computer science. Each student is assigned a faculty-mentor from the Departments of Mathematics or Computer Science for entire degree program. The faculty-mentors are trained by the Offices of Academic Advising and Multicultural Affairs. In addition to scholarships, funds are also provided for travel, special projects, and summer research. At the end of each academic year, an assessment expert from the School of Education conducts an analysis of the criteria for selection of CSAM Scholars, their success in maintaining the award, and its benefits. A summary of this is used for continuation of funding for the students.</AbstractNarration>
