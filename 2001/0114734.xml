    <AbstractNarration>The St. Louis Public Schools (SLPS) serving 42,673 students, of which 81.7% are eligible for free/reduced lunch, 15.3% are students with disabilities, 80% are African American, 17.4% White-non-Hispanic, 1.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1.1% Hispanic, through the St. Louis Urban Systemic Program (SLUSP), proposes to build upon the substantial accomplishments realized under the St. Louis Urban Systemic Initiative (USI) to implement strategies that ensure effective teaching and student success in science and mathematics in all schools throughout the District. The District's policies bearing on mathematics and science graduation requirements, teacher and other staff professional development, and accountability programs conjoined to student achievement, student assessment and program evaluation, curriculum designs objectives/indicators coupled to explicit student learning outcomes, the annual performance standards for each school, school-based management, and infusion of technology into the delivery of instruction serve as the framework, enablers and direction for the overall reform process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of the SLUSP include improving the implementation of standards-based, inquiry-centered science and mathematics education with technology infusion for all students, pre-K-12; increasing the competency of the science and mathematics instructional workforce; expanding the collaborations with colleges and universities for the production of science and mathematics teachers; and increasing the number of skilled entrants into the technology-based workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The District's program is informed by an implementation strategy that includes the following elements:&lt;br/&gt;- Full implementation of the standards-based, inquiry-centered science and mathematics education program with technology infusion for all students, pre-K-12;&lt;br/&gt;- Ensuring that the fully implemented program is a seamless, unitary teaching and learning sequence with regard to the continuum of the standards-based curriculum, instruction, and assessments with distributed accountability for student learning;&lt;br/&gt;- Increasing the competency of the science and mathematics instructional workforce through professional development and teacher education programs characterized by demanding content and performance standards; and&lt;br/&gt;- Enhancing teaching and learning outcomes through the use of state-of-the-art technologies and student support programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SLUSP has defined Student Achievement Benchmarks/Targets, inclusive of baseline data, to be attained in four areas of student achievement:&lt;br/&gt;1) performance on the mathematics and science portions of the statewide tests administered by the Missouri Achievement Program (MAP), &lt;br/&gt;2) performance on the mathematics and science portions of the District-wide TerraNova achievement tests, &lt;br/&gt;3) numbers enrolling in, and the percentage completing, selected advanced high school courses in mathematics and science, and&lt;br/&gt;4) numbers taking, and the scores achieved on, college placement exams such as the SAT and ACT. &lt;br/&gt;In addition, even higher improvement benchmarks for the District's black students were formulated explicitly in order to narrow the existing differences between white and black students on higher level math and science courses and on college placement exams.</AbstractNarration>
